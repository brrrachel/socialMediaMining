## Data
In this folder you find all collected tweets by running:

```

## Backend
For the backend to run, you have to start the server. 
```
cd backend
npm run build
npm run start
```
After every change you have to stop the server and run the build and start command again.
The server runs on port 3000. For communication with the backend use the Access-Service in
