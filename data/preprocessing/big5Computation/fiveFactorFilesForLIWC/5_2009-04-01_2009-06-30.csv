has spoken to lacy greens who are having a great time amusing &quot;Köhler&#39;s campaign speech&quot;
"in the end, Koehler becomes weaker and weaker. Tedious enumeration of all sorts ..."
"Good speech by BuPrä on the state act. A bit too many clichés at the beginning, but little campaign for tomorrow. In the end, he becomes weaker"
now goes to the state act &quot;60 years of the Federal Republic&quot; and thus to the last official speech by Horst Köhler :-)
... and the beekeeping associations did not even get an answer from Schavan (CDU) and Aigner (CSU) on request.
"understands the anger that 90% supporters were invited to the &quot;Round Table&quot; genetic engineering, although 80% of Germans reject it"

"is on the way to Berlin, executive faction board"
"With @kommunalpolitik, now also greets the Bürgerbund Bonn as a follower. First vote? Kelber!"

Did the @julisbonn know that your party has supported &quot;cold progression&quot; in 46 years of government responsibility? #Opposition
Kauder praises the role of the CSU in the creation of the Basic Law. Didn&#39;t they vote against the Basic Law? # CSU
the recorders in the CDU clap particularly keenly against &quot;enemies of unity&quot; at Polemik Kauders #amnesia
"Kauder abuses Basic Law debate for party politics. #GDR. Forgets, that Kohl received Honecker as a state guest for the first time in 1987 # CDU-"
Volker Kauder talks about the Basic Law. First reference to God and abortion right for eight minutes. Main emphasis? # CDU
Too bad that Parliament is only a third occupied in the debate on 60 years of the Basic Law # unworthy

Vote on abortion law unfortunately lost. CDU / CSU misuses group proposal if 100% of its own parliamentarians are in favor
