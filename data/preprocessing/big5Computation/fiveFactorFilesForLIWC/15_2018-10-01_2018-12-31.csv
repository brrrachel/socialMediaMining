". @ Markus_Soeder: This is what this #government stands for. Despite different political positions, let&#39;s work together and constructively for #Bayern. Because Bavaria is worth it."
". @ Markus_Soeder: I want all citizens in the #Free State #Bavaria to feel in good hands, that the Bavarians are proud of their country and can rely on the # politics of the state government."
"@Markus_Soeder: My #Vision: #Bavaria should remain a special country - a stable, productive, an endearing one and one with a high # quality of life."
. @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria is one of the most attractive economic regions in the world. We have almost full employment and the lowest youth unemployment in Europe.
". @ Markus_Soeder: We pursue active economic policy. A modern Bavaria has a powerful economic policy. Economy is not everything, but without economy everything is nothing."
. @ Markus_Soeder: Our long-term goal is to develop the first Bavarian quantum computer. This marks the beginning of a new era in computer technology from Bavaria.
". @ Markus_Soeder: Over the next few years, we will be investing over 280 million euros in a competence network &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; consisting of eight universities and other well-known non-university research institutions."
". @ Markus_Soeder: We want to set new impulses in three strategic areas: Artificial Intelligence, Aerospace and Supercomputing."
". @ Markus_Soeder: In order to be successful in the competition for teachers, we will increase the starting salary for all teachers and almost completely eliminate time limits."
". @ Markus_Soeder: The teachers in Bavaria do a great job! We will employ 5,000 new teachers by 2023. We reduce the number of lessons lost and achieve smaller class sizes."
. @ Markus_Soeder: We reject the uniform school. We don&#39;t want ideological debates at school.
. @ Markus_Soeder: No other country in Germany invests as much in every single school child and in every single student as the Free State.
. @ Markus_Soeder: School policy is and remains a national issue. All federal states agree on this.
". @ Markus_Soeder: A word about the #Digitalpakt: we want it. But we also want a strong educational federalism. Diversity is not a disadvantage, but rather a strength of the German education system."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Digital education is a key issue. In the coming year alone, we want to set up around 10,000 digital classrooms together with the municipalities. There will be a total of 50,000."
". @ Markus_Soeder: The basis of digitization in Bavaria is the # broadband expansion. We have now laid more than 43,000 kilometers of glass fiber."
". @ Markus_Soeder: We are shaping the digital awakening. Our development depends on #digitization. In the digital world, data is the currency of the 21st century. We want to actively help shape this change of era in Bavaria."

. @ Markus_Soeder: #Bavaria is our #home. Bavaria is also a # lifestyle. Anyone who comes to us immediately senses that life is good here.
. @ Markus_Soeder: #Bayern wants to be a good partner in #Europe. Bavaria is in the heart of Europe and has Europe in its heart.
". @ Markus_Soeder: #Migration policy is also an international challenge. In order to prevent many people from embarking on the dangerous route of flight in the first place, combating the # causes of flight on the ground is a common international task."
. @ Markus_Soeder: We stand unreservedly on the #fund right to #Asylum. But it is also clear that there is no requirement that anyone who comes to us for economic or other reasons can also stay with us.
". @ Markus_Soeder: We will be the first federal state to pass its own victim protection law. Because it is important that we not only talk about the psyche of the perpetrators, but also pay more attention to the protection and aftercare of the victims."
. @ Markus_Soeder: We will reduce overtime hours by at least 10% each year and reward night shifts better. This is an appreciation for the work of our police officers in Bavaria. #Police
. @ Markus_Soeder: We stand by our #Police. We strengthen her back and put trust in the officials.
. @ Markus_Soeder: We have the fewest crimes and the highest clearance rate. It should stay that way. #Safety
". @ Markus_Soeder: More freedom, less nagging, more advice, less sanction. This is our way for a business-friendly Free State."
". @ Markus_Soeder: In addition to the shortage of skilled workers, taxes play a central role for the business location. We are therefore against any form of tax increase."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria stands by its #handicraft: We are increasing the master bonus to 2,000 euros, thereby setting a signal for the craft. Such a master bonus is only available in Bavaria."
. @ Markus_Soeder: Vocational and academic training are equally important. We are strengthening the dual training system and are committed to making the master craftsman&#39;s certificate mandatory again for more skilled trades.
". @ Markus_Soeder: You need a strategic and active economic policy for industry, # SMEs and # crafts. Performance has to pay off, performance is supported."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Our BayernHeim is building 10,000 new state-owned apartments for normal earners. It starts in Munich with the large-scale project on the McGraw site with over 1,000 apartments and dormitory spaces."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Our goal is 500,000 new apartments in Bavaria by 2025."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Those who have children in Bavaria should receive the best possible care. That is why we not only receive obstetrics in rural areas, but above all strengthen our midwives. In addition to the midwife bonus from 1,000 euros a year there is a starter package of 5,000 euros."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Together with the municipalities, we will invest over two billion euros in medical care in rural areas in the coming years."
. @ Markus_Soeder: This is what our family allowance stands for. But that&#39;s not all! We also make all kindergarten years largely free of charge and from 2020 we will support daycare and day care with 100 euros per child per month.
". @ Markus_Soeder: We support regardless of the type of care you choose, whether at home or in daycare. Because we want real freedom of choice for families."
". @ Markus_Soeder: We are a family coalition &amp; Bavaria is a family country. Our guiding principle is: We help families, but do not prescribe anything for them."
". @ Markus_Soeder: To govern civilly means to govern well. Solving problems objectively instead of constantly arguing, improving the present and at the same time planning the future with foresight."
". @ markus_soeder: The new Bavaria coalition is based on shared beliefs, concepts and trust."
. @ markus_soeder: The Bavarian population has given the #CSU and the free voters a clear government mandate - and we want to do that.

". @ Markus_Soeder: What kind of Bavaria do you want, what kind of Bavaria do you expect. What is best for you? #jazuBayern #darumcsu"
". @ markus_soeder: We have developed a concept from # anchor centers, # border police and state office for # asylum. And it works: The right ones stay and the right ones go. #jazuBayern"
. @ markus_soeder: We stand for humanity and order! I want to help everyone who wants to get involved. But those who commit acts of violence must leave our country as quickly as possible. #JAzuBayern
". @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria is not only a country of glittering towers, but also of warmth and humanity. With our #Country care allowance of 1000 euros, we are sending a clear signal that the love + work of the caring relatives is worth a lot to us. #JAzuBayern"
. @ Markus_Soeder: We have strengthened palliative and hospice medicine in Bavaria. Each of us has to walk the last few meters and I want us in Bavaria to walk these last meters with the same dignity as we lived. #jazuBayern
. @ Markus_Soeder on #Care: I would like us to show how human and social the Free State of #Bavaria is. #jazuBayern

. @ Markus_Soeder: Our country Germany has a backbone. This backbone is Bavaria. But Bavaria also has a backbone and that is the Christian Social Union! #JAzuBayern pic.twitter.com/yYsPDYZJmk

. @ MarkusBlume: We fight for our beliefs and the people in our country. #JAzuBayern
". @ MarkusBlume: Over the next 12 days, let&#39;s fight to keep this Free State unique. This is only possible with the #CSU! #JAzuBayern"
. @ MichaelFrieser and @MarkusBlume open the rally in Nuremberg: We are fighting to keep Bavaria stable! #JAzuBayern
