@norberthense total nonsense. The @nico previously blogged about it: http://lumma.de/2013/11/27/die-digitale-agenda-im-koalitionsvertrag/… - digital was rarely so much in one koav.
@norberthense not at all. I reject them and believe that the ECJ decides wisely.

@ Papapreuss that&#39;s nonsense. there are enough lessons to draw from the result. But your topic hopping shows that you agree with me. Thank you!
"@papapreuss how do you know it will be bad? I do not know it. yes, we promised content and got 25% for it."
"@papapreuss problem is not groko, but how SPD positions itself and how it acts. fear is never good."
