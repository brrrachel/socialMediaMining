"&quot;Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews that can be expressed as hatred of Jews. Anti-Semitism is directed, in word or deed, at Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and / or their property, ...&quot;"
why don&#39;t you google it yourself? There are enough studies on the side of the family ministry and the constitutional court ruling with references.
I would be happy to help you with your legal perception: http://honestlyconcerned.info/2015/01/05/generalbundesanwalt-sennt-kein-israelisches-fehlrechte-in-bez-auf-mavi-marmara/‚Ä¶
"No, the Federal Prosecutor&#39;s Office checked and legally confirmed this in the context of advertisements in the Causa Flotilla."
That was at least clearly anti-Semitic. You wouldn&#39;t have to be right for that.
Why is that relevant?
Hat!
"Israel does not slaughter people, maybe that is what Hamas and Islamic Jihad do. Israel is also ready for &quot;Land for Peace&quot;, see Sinai, see Lebanon, also Gaza in 2005, only then did Hamas come."
"In 1958, Gaza was controlled by Egypt and the West Bank and East Jerusalem were occupied by Jordan, and the Jews were driven out. Otherwise there was no crew."
"Religions are never fixed structures, they only become concrete through believers and their interpretations. Therefore there is no Islam, no Christianity or no atheism"
"1958, what was there?"
There are one-sidedness on different sides and there are people who try to deal with the problems without looking at the group from which they start.
Al Kahlil is Hebron and it is not in Gaza. I can not see that someone is shot.
Berlin provincial antics about dialogue initiative incapable of criticism: Transparency &amp; courage to confront! Otherwise you work in the hands of Muslims and &quot;Islam&quot; who are generally suspected # meet2respect https://www.facebook.com/VolkerBeckMdB/posts/10156618747592698
You assume someone has a certain distorted perception of reality because of his supposedly being Jewish. That is an anti-Semitic degradation. At least stand by it!
Dear @berlinliebich @PetraPauMaHe @SevimDagdelen @DietmarBartsch @katjakipping How did such a one-sided anti-Israeli decision by @dieLinke come about? That is beyond any balance. https://www.die-linke.de/parte/parteistrstruktur/parteivorstand/2016-2018/beschluesse/detail/news/fuer-ein-ende-der-besatzung-und-der-blockade-von-gaza/‚Ä¶
When was that supposed to be where and what do you see there?
I think that&#39;s politically a little naive. I would only do that when negotiating specific disarmament offers. A ‚Äúworking visit‚Äù without a fuss was enough.
"While the Israeli independent judiciary&#39;s corruption investigation against @netanyahu and his family is rightly reported, the reporting largely fails to depict the grievances &amp; realities in the Palestinian Territories. https://twitter.com/kas_palestine/status/1014468087385612290‚Ä¶"
I don&#39;t find the word &quot;Hamas&quot; in the statement. Can you tell me where I read &quot;Hamas&quot;?
Where do you distance yourself from the violent protests when you write about &quot;mostly peaceful protests&quot;? The condemnation of the rocket attacks from Gaza is clearly delimited by an &quot;addition&quot; thematically.
"Iran policy must face the realities of the Iranian regime and its terror policy in the region. IKG: President Rouhani is part of the problem, not the solution via @APAOTS https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20180704_OTS0050/ikg-praesident-rouhani-ist-teil-des-problems-nicht-der-loesung ..."
"In case of doubt, that too. The heads of state cannot be chosen. However, economic relations must not be promoted without consideration. One should not close one&#39;s eyes to the fact that the current Iranian leadership is using economic scope for armament."
"&quot;In addition&quot;; the condemnation of the violent aspects of the protests, the tunnels etc. is missing. The attempt to break through the border with violence and weapons is minimized as a &quot;mostly peaceful mass protest&quot;."
what do you think about him? Will there be a critical discussion at @dieLinke &amp; @Linksfraktion?
"On an international package, you also have to talk to the villains. The central thing for me is that you don&#39;t talk about problems and that you show attitude. It is not a scandal for me to talk."
"it is really just a question of what requirements there are for a full quotation, which can also be used in any other way. The distance must also be disseminated, so that the suggestion that it is a current position is impossible."
"I would sign the quota. Nonetheless, in external relations, it always depends on the objects that are processed there and how. I am afraid that the state visit was the wrong one. But that&#39;s another level of criticism."
Copyright should not help me. It is enough if my work cannot be disseminated without being asked and without reason without further distancing. I published it myself.

I do not think so. She is the only one who still keeps a cool head in the mess.
Withdrawal from withdrawal? # seehofer withdrawal I bet in the summer of 2019 the Federal Interior Minister is not called Seehofer. Who is betting against it?
kind of cool her prudence.
"If #Seehofer resigns, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. He didn&#39;t want to be Minister of the Interior. He couldn&#39;t do anything with the office. He radiated that all the time and that was probably the impression of many in his house. #SeehoferRuecktrit"

Do you as the federal government or @BMI_Bund take action against the unauthorized use by @csu with the #Masterplan as with the Afghanistan papers / @FunkeBerlin?
