"There are many reasons to criticize # Orb√°n, #Fidesz, Hungarian government. For anti-Semitic campaigns against scientists / NGOs defamed as &quot;# Soros mercenaries&quot; for human rights violations in refugee camps. PSt Schr√∂der #CDU also has a criticism: pic.twitter.com/cIuEzwcwzg"
"For anti-fascists in and outside the #Bundestag, for everyone who stands up against #Racism, for people who want to know which right-wing networks are working in the #AfD group: read.

"The man from the Federal Chancellery, who repeatedly tried to curtail Parliament&#39;s right to ask questions in the #NSAUA, is now throwing himself in front of the secret services again. Denial of the right to information under press law reveals blatant contempt for #press freedom. https://twitter.com/bild_reporter/status/984301535671840768‚Ä¶"
"50 years ago today, Rudi Dutschke was gunned down by a concerned citizen. Right-wing terror has history. The agitation against the left too. #Right Terror #RudiDutschke"
"A year ago, Shaden M. was run over and killed in #Cottbus. Now another car is racing into a group of people. Both perpetrators shouted racist slogans. Perpetrator of # M√ºnster should have contacts in the right-wing scene #Racism kills! http://www.der-rechte-rand.de/archive/2521/autos_waffen/‚Ä¶"
Also my little question on &quot;Knowledge of the investigative authorities on contacts of Anis Amri to the so-called IS&quot; http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/011/1901185.pdf‚Ä¶
The assassin from the #Breitscheidplatz was not a single offender and was integrated into a jihadist network. #The Investigation Committee urgently needs to investigate whether authorities have done everything possible to investigate other parties involved in the attack. https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article175256562/Festnahme-Polizei-verhundet--Terroranschlag-Berliner-Halbmarathon-.htmln‚Ä¶
The AK47 in the apartment and material for the construction of explosive devices then go well with the neighborhood in Pirna. In the case of &quot;mentally unstable&quot; I am cautious after the story from Gundolf K√∂hler to David Sonboly. # M√ºnster http://www.lvz.de/Region/Mitteldeutschland/Todesfahrer-von-Muenster-Polizei-durchsuche-offenbar-Wohnungen-in-Sachsen‚Ä¶
"Would type the searched neo-Nazis are not only &quot;# Reich citizens&quot;, but there are contacts to organized militant rights such as # European Action or # III.Weg.

"Rapid recovery for the injured, consolation and support for the relatives, recognition for the rescue workers and caregivers. #Muenster"
This is clearly going too far! Then the suitcase is placed in the storage space between &quot;do you drive in the direction of travel&quot; &quot;do you drive in the direction of travel&quot; and good.

Pretty opaque story. Why do the files leave the #LKA or the Senate unpaginated? Why are the files filed in the #Examination Board? And all of the important TK√ú protocols. https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/berliner-untersuchungsausschuss-affaere-um-amri-akten-betrifft-auch-heikle-dokumente/21131948.html‚Ä¶ #Breitscheidplatz
