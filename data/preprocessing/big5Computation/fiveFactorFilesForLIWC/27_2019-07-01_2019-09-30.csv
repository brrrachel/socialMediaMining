"Right, but it only exists because it is defended with massive means against left-wing intolerant undemocrats, as we can see from the example."

1. I do not use the addition. 2. A correct claim does not go wrong because others used it similarly. 3. The KPD had already used this statement. So it is cross-warehouse.

"Can you think of anything more with such a horrific act of your gold pieces? Embarrassing and impious. Left, right?"
"Please who is killed by right politics, how?"
"To my knowledge, unfortunately no."
"If you want to have something like this prevented in the future, then you have to concentrate on the crime and the perpetrator, everyone knows that with a bit of common sense. Is done the same way with other crimes. What does that have to do with instrumentalizing, please?"
Please where and when did I say something unconfirmed?
"Of course, it does not matter who is the victim of such an act of horror, in any case the perpetrators must be severely punished and those responsible for politics must be named and voted out!"
"Sure, but are you still perfectly clean of wishing someone to die like this?"
"The deed is not instrumentalized, but criticized. Strange that this concerns you more than the act of terror itself. And who is a &quot;Nazi&quot; here please?"

"Oh yes, I also ask myself, but the information about it was very contradictory. Was there a threat and which one exactly?"
"Since the state of health is not / was not yet clear, condolences would be too early, right? And my followers may be a bit premature about perpetrators, but they probably refer to the experiences of the past few years."
"I also don&#39;t know why the lunatics attach so much importance to a protest without a bra, you have to ask them yourself."
"It is understandable that you cannot explain many things. The &quot;note&quot; comes from the target left reactionaries themselves, I only reproduced."

"Please what did i whine you crybaby? The AfD has canceled, not us."

"Because it&#39;s not a fake, very simple."
"Nevertheless, I can have the opinion that these people belong in a prison. Apart from that, you have to set up a corresponding equivalent for the foreign country, which does not mean &quot;prison&quot;, but is defined similarly. And again: first think then write."

It is somewhat irresponsible that the police actually insist on public statements on ongoing investigations. Just have a look at the criminal charges at hand.

https://www.lvz.de/Region/Markkleeberg/Farbanschlag-auf-Wohnung-von-AfD-Politiker-in-Markkleeberg‚Ä¶ What exactly was blown up?
https://www.lvz.de/Region/Markkleeberg/Farbanschlag-auf-Wohnung-von-AfD-Politiker-in-Markkleeberg‚Ä¶ rather leftist class in his element?
"https://www.lvz.de/Region/Markkleeberg/Farbanschlag-auf-Wohnung-von-AfD-Politiker-in-Markkleeberg‚Ä¶ nope, but with truths yes"
"https://www.lvz.de/Region/Markkleeberg/Farbanschlag-auf-Wohnung-von-AfD-Politiker-in-Markkleeberg‚Ä¶ oh so? Rather, you are ridiculous."
"https://www.lvz.de/Region/Markkleeberg/Farbanschlag-auf-Wohnung-von-AfD-Politiker-in-Markkleeberg ... well, there is no left violence ... # linksbl√∂d"
https://www.lvz.de/Region/Markkleeberg/Farbanschlag-auf-Wohnung-von-AfD-Politiker-in-Markkleeberg ... you are the dreamers

"The left-hand mob rules in Leipzig, something like that comes from installing a SOKO Rex but forgetting the SOKO Lex. The German state is not a constitutional state as long as it tolerates leftist violence and aggression! #ADPM #Poggenburg https://www.radioleipzig.de/beitrag/poggenburg-demo-doch-verlege-594042/‚Ä¶"
"As almost to be expected, the rule of law collapses! Due to massive left escalation, the city of Leipzig is now unable to enable a safe demo in Connewitz. In consultation with the city, we will once again follow the relocation to Simsonplatz at 6 p.m. üá©üá™"
I wasn&#39;t there at the time and I reject any violence in political discourse. Rush somewhere else.
We can be curious whether the rule of law will stand up to this leftist line of violence or buckle again! üá©üá™ # ADPM
You have a poor understanding of democracy! The GG applies everywhere and for everyone.
"This is exactly how it has to be, that violent left-wing peers also have to learn."
&quot;Calls for violence against the police&quot; This immediately confirms the need for our rally under the motto: &quot;Consistently counter left anarchy and aggression&quot;. #ADPM #Poggenburg https://www.mdr.de/sachsen/leipzig/demonstration-leipzig-connewitz-vorab-100.html‚Ä¶
"Greaseproof notes of the dull, intolerant left-wing peers! #ADPM #NoAntifa pic.twitter.com/lZgGLAkNP0"
Today in Connewitz everyone is challenged to stand up for the RIGHT state! üá©üá™üôãüèº‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Current information: In Leipzig there were nightly raids with weapons on &quot;rights&quot;, and left arms stores are said to have been excavated by the police. This is #link terrorism, the rule of law must finally fight back! #ADPM #Poggenburg"
It&#39;s surprising that you have to struggle in this way to exercise a fundamental right. We hope for a peaceful rally against violent left-wing extremism in Leipzig-Connewitz tomorrow. #ADPM #Poggenburg https://m.lvz.de/Leipzig/Polizeiticker/Polizeiticker-Leipzig/Stadt-Leipzig-laesst-Poggenburg-nach-Connewitz-und-schweigt‚Ä¶
"Short election of von der Leyen as President of the European Commission. Perhaps it will do the same damage there as in the Ministry of Defense, which is a glimmer of hope. #ADPM"
The evidence against #Individual case are the daily incidents. Just take your left ideological glasses off and think.
"And again the heaviest knife attack by &quot;protection seekers&quot;! It is precisely this cultural enrichment that has brought us red-green politics, of course, just an # individual case. If you vote on the left, you choose mass murder &amp; homicide in the multi-cultural craze. #ADPM https://www.salzgitter-zeitung.de/salzgitter/article226493777/Salzgitter-Mann-rammt-Frau-ein-Messer-in-den-Kopf.html‚Ä¶"
well definitely
then go against left fascism
"Then left-wing parties that openly cooperate with left-wing extremist organizations such as IL, RH or VVN would have to be observed by the US in the future, right?"
"I consider the classification of @IBDeutschland as right-wing extremist to be completely exaggerated; here, too, left and right are measured with completely different standards! #ADPM üá©üá™"
Finally on July 17th in Leipzig-Connewitz! Motto: &quot;Consistently counter left anarchy and aggression&quot; #ADPM #Poggenburg üá©üá™ pic.twitter.com/7OEVJhG7L9
"Then you didn&#39;t really listen to my speech! I had spoken in my speech from the Association of the Turkish Community in Germany, which previously also spoke very improperly about Germans. This is exactly what the political Ash Wednesday is for."
"Nobody should be sentenced for the rescue (down from an intact boat?), For carrying it on to Europe. Let&#39;s wait."
"So we know that sea rescue ‚úÖ is not the same as towing ‚ùå, right?"
regarding ‚ÄúMerkel gang‚Äù? ü§î
PS: international maritime law does not provide for illegal towing!
Process the Volksschaden in a suitable prison.
What does reason have to do with &quot;brown sauce&quot;?
"Reasonable and logical assessment of the situation, apart from left hysteria &amp; utopia. Clear no, also from Austria to illegal trafficking! Since the left-wing Merkel gang can see something. Are @matteosalvinimi and @sebastiankurz #Nazi? https://m.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/streit-um-hafenoeffnung-kurz-unterstuetzt-salvini-16271624.html?GEPC=s2‚Ä¶"
"Drugs are rather the elixir of left-wing peers, so their kind. So stay calm, even if it is difficult for you with the pear slammed shut."
"Just an agreed mess, who should be sold here all over the world as a &quot;German culprit&quot;! It is enough, therefore #ADPM. pic.twitter.com/6BoOFFO8Ww"
They gave the answer themselves: one should say &quot;no more&quot;. So left speech dictation.
The term &quot;negro&quot; has only become a &quot;racist&quot; term in left-wing hollows in recent years. This voice dictation is just annoying.
Maybe because he&#39;s not?
"A &quot;negro child&quot;, it said there."
Are you stupid now or are you? Greens - pedophilia; Islam (courted by the left) - child marriages etc. ... ring the bell?
"1. &quot;Negro child&quot; is not a racist term because it was not used by me. 2. ‚ÄúFamily Rot‚Äù would surely have Stalin &amp; Co. on the walls, would sexually assault the child and teach him to light cars and smash panes and heads."
"Please read and understand the article, even if you are having a hard time."
"Firstly, I do not have the term Negro child, which I learned at school, forbidden today, and secondly, I only quoted from the program."
"‚ÄúFamily Braun‚Äù is currently playing on #ZDF, neo-Nazi flat share welcomes Negerkind, quite funny. Hope there will be &quot;Family Red&quot;, or will it only be distributed unilaterally !? Who knows more?"
All the same left-degenerate gang.
just like that
"Oh, there is a left wing waving wildly with the #Nazikeule and swaggering about &quot;embarrassing&quot;. ü§¶üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"I wrote &quot;people ...&quot; and I meant it that way. They should have been saved and brought back, THAT would have been sea rescue!"
"So you think this illegal trafficking is good, right?"
"#Steinmeier is politically unwise and presumptuous! In addition, in his simplicity, he is unable to distinguish &quot;human rescue&quot; from &quot;human smuggling&quot;, just embarrassing the man. #ADPM https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute/steinmeier-im-zdf-sommerinterview-100.html‚Ä¶"
"Well, would be a guarantee of further decline of the SPD."
"Do more often, right?"
"Teene delivers arrogant speech of anger and triggers truancy because she teases with a one-sided opinion. Any non-left would have been assumed to have intolerant hate speech, but red-green simply cannot be bad. because what cannot be cannot be"
"Well, that&#39;s exactly how lonely callers and reminders often faced the emergence of dictatorships. And again and again there were and are mentally idle followers and mockers."
"So it is beyond doubt, I also found out in the left-wing extremism committee."
"Finally you understand it too. Of course, things that are politically incorrect are always left out in the system media. Hence # gap press."
"It was also about the behavior and appearance of the left mob! There is no &quot;mistake&quot; there, you do not need to pretend."
"It is shameful and significant at the same time: # Concentration camp survivors feel reminded of the Nazis by the appearance of #Antifa &amp; Co.! We have been saying it for a long time, the next intolerant, violent, undemocratic mob is brewing on the left. #NoAntifa https://www.compact-online.de/wiesbaden-kz-ueberlebende-solidarisiert-sich-mit-gelbwesten- Gegen-antifa/‚Ä¶"
Job gone due to political abnormalities? We know that from red and brown regimes. Something like that is a shame for a (formerly) liberal-democratic constitutional state and a further harbinger of everything that comes along in this way. https://m.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/chef-der-hessischen-filmfoerderung-muss-posten-raeumen-16401009.html‚Ä¶
"Oh, 500 are a handful ... And you ask me about my hostility to science? Do you notice what?"
Your question can only have been rhetorical.
"There was also progress with the car, even if it doesn&#39;t always have to be good, but what is there now as an offer to replace it? Environmentally harmful, impractical electric cars?"
How great must arrogance and stupidity be if a ‚Äú16-year-old autistic woman‚Äù wants to teach the world and some still trample uncritically afterwards.
A glance at the home countries of Islam is sufficient.
