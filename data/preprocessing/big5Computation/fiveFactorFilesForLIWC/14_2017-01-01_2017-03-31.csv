"#Europe no longer needs German money, but more focus on its core tasks."
Schulz must finally finish the wall and explain himself. Ducking away and keeping silent is no longer possible after the complaint of the EU committee!
Everyone must be clear that with the SPD there is more Europe and no better Europe.
Mr. Schulz is slimming down. Our country does not need a party Schulz that shuns responsibility.
It remains: # Turkey will not join the EU!
"Germany gives, the rest of Europe takes, this business model cannot be done with us."
"It is absurd if the EU&#39;s largest net contributor, according to the SPD foreign minister, should dig deeper for Europe."
"In the coalition committee, Schulz would have the chance for very specific political work, but the SPD party is more important to him."
"After the last few days, I go one step further and say: Abort negotiations with # Turkey!"
"It is important that we return quickly, even with collective deportations to #Afghanistan."
The state of Berlin has become an #AsylMecca. That is exactly the wrong signal!
"#Erdogan, who locks up journalists and wants to introduce the death penalty, sits in the glass house and still throws with thick boulders."
"We in Germany are concerned about public order and defend democracy, so we do not need to be insulted for that"
The Nazi comparison is as insolent as it is absurd. An apology is due here. No Turkish domestic politics on German soil
The Nazi comparison is a new low point in Turkish-German relations. An outrageous derailment of the despot from the Bosphorus.
This is an unacceptable abuse of guest rights when Turkish politicians take advantage of German freedom of assembly.
Enemies of democracy want to take advantage of our openness and promote the death penalty in # Turkey.
We do not want Turkish domestic politics on German soil.
"At their party congress, the Gaga Greens turned sharply to the left and moved away from the middle class of society."
"The short result shows how torn, unpredictable and therefore unreliable the Greens are. # Spitzenduo17"
The deportation stop of red-green and red-red-green federal states is a clear and open violation of the law. #AsylMekka
"If the result is deportation after an asylum procedure under the rule of law, deportation must be carried out!"
"Turkey is moving further and further away from Europe, Turkey&#39;s entry into the EU is completely unthinkable."
The developments in Turkey are unbearable. An attempt is being made to lock journalists away and to silence them.
"The Turkish Prime Minister is not supposed to campaign in Germany, but to finally respect the fundamental right of freedom of the press."
The #Toll is coming - in compliance with European law and without additional burden for domestic drivers.
The @SPDde will be punished just as much for its rumbling as it is for its red-red-green flashing.
"Playing coalition games instead of delivering content, people are fed up with it to the max."
"The socialists have no program, no perspective and only one greedy candidate who wants to &quot;conquer&quot; the chancellery at all costs."
At @SPDde there is panic after the Saarland crash. https://t.co/Je458pCuY9
Promised! Held! #PKWmaut https://t.co/WGTX26i2zx
@CSU enforces: Burglar 1 year in prison! Deportation for social fraudsters! Child marriages are prohibited! #Groko
Goofing about &#39;unjust Germany&#39; and adding extra allowances to the environment in addition to the Brussels salaries: this is a fat dog.
Voters in Germany are entitled to full clarity about what he does as President of Brussels.

It becomes completely absurd and irresponsible when SPD leader Schulz goes to @spdbt and is represented on the coalition committee.
Under the pressure of the facts @MartinSchulz is now hanging its flag in the wind. The Hü-und-Hott-Schulz is completely unbelievable.
"In January @MartinSchulz, as President of the European Parliament, spoke out for accession talks. #Turkey"
The refusal of the candidate @MartinSchulz to join Turkey # EU is flimsy.
The Federal Government can also show the red card to Turkish propaganda at any time.
It was overdue for the Chancellor&#39;s Office to show the despot from the Bosphorus a yellow card and to threaten a # entry ban.
The #Propaganda from # Turkey endangers our peaceful coexistence in Germany.
For @CSU it is crystal clear: we do not want Turkish domestic politics on German soil.
"We first have to register, accommodate and integrate the refugees who are already living here."
The Brussels School also stands as Berlin School for open borders and mass immigration. Our country is overwhelmed!
"If, on the other hand, the SPD wanted to make family reunification possible again, this would set the wrong incentives."
SPD zigzag policy with a heavy left-wing twist on immigration! The current regulation has been agreed with the votes of the SPD.
"Those who want to get involved in the domestic politics of their country of origin instead can do so there, but not in Germany."
"For us it is clear: First comes the integration, then the passport. #Doppelpass"
The German passport is not a junk article that one takes along with the citizenship of the country of origin. #Doppelpass
Anyone who wants to take German citizenship as a child of foreign parents should show that they are committed to our values and principles
We need to return to the proven option model. #Doppelpass
"One thing is clear: @Die_Gruenen want unlimited influx into our country, open borders without control and change Germany."
The right of asylum is not made for economic migrants.
". @ Die_Gruenen could have sent the clear signal today that they are against asylum abuse, they missed this opportunity."
Rejection rates of asylum seekers from the Maghreb countries are 99 percent.
"Blocking @Die_Gruenen when Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia are classified as safe countries of origin is an invitation to asylum abuse."

Majority of Germans consider candidate Schulz to be unbelievable (survey @BILDamSonntag). With every #SchulzFake the unbelievability grows.
It turns out: Candidate Schulz has no idea about domestic politics and internal security.
The red and green governed countries are over-indebted and do not employ enough police officers.
The red and green governed countries have saved on the #Polizei and are behind in the crime statistics.
Another #SchulzFake when candidate Schulz claims the Union saved the police. The opposite is the case!

The EU Commission clearly sees the German #Toll as conforming to European law.
"With so much technical ignorance, one has to ask the question of the meaning of the scientific service. #Toll"
These constructed allegations are simply incorrect. #Toll
"Once again in the Bundestag, so-called experts have submitted a commission report from the Greens against the #toll."
"For @CSU it is clear: integration comes first, then the passport, then the right to vote - not the other way around."
Right to vote for migrants without a German passport? @oezoguz does an integration-political somersault backwards.
Facts ensure clarity in the political debate and cannot be prohibited. #Klartext
#SchulddenSchulz has to face the question of what should be socially just if German savers had to pay for Greek debts.
"Voters should know that @MartinSchulz, for example, called for Eurobonds."
The @spdde should not play the self-defeating when justified criticism is voiced. The SPD wants a muzzle for # Schulz critics.

The @CSU will not let up until this campaign is stopped. #Hendricks #peasant rules
These so-called #peasant rules show anti-peasant thinking of the #SPD: Hendricks wants to spoil producers of our food more and more.
The #SPD has already burned far too much tax money in this defamation campaign by the Federal Environment Ministry.
This unspeakable peasant bashing by the SPD minister #Hendricks must be stopped immediately. #Bauernregeln

"The SPD personnel panel is not a sign of a new beginning and future, but of standstill and staff shortages."
#SPD And the new Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries has already announced that she will no longer run for the Bundestag.
"SPD sends last contingent. Given the global political situation, it is irresponsible to appoint Gabriel as the foreign minister"
Our course remains unchanged: Prevent a left front from running down Germany with # r2g. #Gabriel
"Candidate @MartinSchulz is the last contingent, and he will not succeed either. #Gabriel"
We experience panic and chaos with the 20 percent SPD. #Gabriel
We will prevent red-red-green from taking power and running down Germany. Even @cem_oezdemir doesn&#39;t change that.
