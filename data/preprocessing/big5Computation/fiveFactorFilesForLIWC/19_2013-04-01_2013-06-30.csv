The Turkish government must finally realize that it cannot bludgeon the protest against its policies.
The only answer to the completely disproportionate police operation against protesters on Taksim Square in Istanbul must be dialogue
The European Parliament should have a crucial control role in monetary policy.
A full-time president for the Eurogroup would be another institution with dubious democratic legitimacy.
It is long overdue for the EU to finally define a common economic and social policy that has never existed at all.
It is high time that sovereign Germany banned the United States from waging war from Germany.
"Due to the US combat drone operations controlled from Rammstein, war was again waged from German soil without sending German soldiers"
