"The #EU has been run by conservatives for 15 years. Since then, inequality in Europe has grown significantly. The unrest in society increases: The United States voted #Trump, the British voted #Brexit, in France Navy #LePen made it to the runoff."

CDU / CSU speak of freedom. Do you mean the freedom of justice and science that your buddy Viktor Orban smashes? Or the freedom of the press that is attacked by your buddy Sebastian Kurz? Or the AKK attacks on the freedom of same-sex marriages?
Great atmosphere and 800 people at our campaign launch in Saarbrücken. Together with @katarinabarley and @UdoBullmann we are fighting for a social #Europe - and against the agitators &amp; splitters who want to destroy Europe. #Europe is the answer # European election2019 📸 Thomas Imo pic.twitter.com/jgWVhXEZHT
I buy your book ok? Right after I finished reading Daniel Goffart. But you don&#39;t get me wrong every day anymore. Deal?
Bad idea: when conservatives like Sebastian Kurz bring a right-wing populist party like the # FPÖ into the government and court. Good idea: show your attitude. Watch the @arminwolf program on ORF at 10 p.m. Not an inch! #TeamWolf https://www.arminwolf.at/2019/04/28/etwas-das-nicht-ohne- sequences-bleiben-kann/…
"Europavision @spdde: A Europe of people with cohesion, fair taxes for corporations &amp; investments in education, equal opportunities &amp; infrastructure.

Where did he do that?
Are you on Twitter?
na gut
He has little idea about football
Because many have asked: why the Conservatives will not save Europe and we need a social Europe to suppress the right-wing attack.

The Conservatives have ruled the #EU for 15 years. There has been division and more right-wing populism all over Europe. We need a change of course. We need #cohesion &amp; a social #Europe: https://link.spd.de/europaretten #EuropaistdieAnantwort # Europawahl2019 pic.twitter.com/cAY1GnwlJV

"So that this is clear: #Conservatives are not right-wing populist. But who pays homage to Orbán, who campaigns more often with FPÖ friend Kurz than with Merkel, who publicly supports AfD candidates for the Bundestag vice has a problem with the demarcation."
"Europ. Minimum wages (12 euros in Germany), consistent corporate taxation, equal wages for men and women, a training place guarantee for under 25 year olds. That is our social vision of a European future."

"#Press freedom is under attack, report @ReporterOG. In Europe and Germany. &quot;The systematic agitation against journalists has led them to work increasingly in a climate of fear&quot;. That threatens our democracy. Our freedom. Such messages: incredible pic.twitter.com/0ghj8X7jOP"
Hear more Fortuna Ehrenfeld!
"It would be nice if the Union were less concerned with personnel games and more with what interests people: the basic pension, the end of the fixed-term contract and questions about future investments. We have to do that together. https://m.saarbruecker-zeitung.de/nachrichten/politik/inland/spd-generalsekretaer-klingbeil-will-keine-kanzlerin-krampp-karrenbauer_aid-38134529… pic.twitter.com/JzBiZSREgI"

I met the @seawatchcrew. Thanks @KuehniKev for the conversation idea. I am grateful for the valuable work in the Mediterranean. Attacks by the Conservatives and the right against #sea rescue are unbearable. We have to do more to really protect those seeking protection pic.twitter.com/IKbtLp8dk4

#Upload filters would have been off the table long ago if the CDU and CSU had been in the EP! I expect @akk to finally put her words into action and to file a protocol statement with us to get by without #Uploadfilter. You should report to the Chancellery urgently!

The #Grundrente is recognition for everyone who has worked for 35 years but still cannot make ends meet in old age. Now we have solid funding &amp; again the Union is not satisfied. I&#39;m curious to see how she wants to explain her anti-posture &amp; social cold. pic.twitter.com/9plcs77LBC
"Paul, 1. please make a point before @hubertus_heil so that you can read more, 2. what is your idea? 3. Is the Mövenpick tax more important to you than the better life of 3 million pensioners?"
"Strong performance by @katarinabarley in #ZDF. It has become clear again today: We want a Europe that stands for cohesion and not this cold, technocratic Europe that Weber and the #CDU #CSU want! #wasmireuropabringt"
It is not understandable that the CDU / CSU immediately reject Heil / Scholz&#39;s proposal. Union now has to decide: Hold on to the Mövenpick tax or use the money for a basic pension for millions of pensioners who have so far had too little? I&#39;m for: # basic pension now!
Pffft
Thank you @hubertus_heil and @OlafScholz - this is a really strong recognition of the life performance of so many people and good for the cohesion in our country! https://twitter.com/tagesschau/status/1130874763994456064…
Ey hallo?
The buddies of AFD #Farage and #Strache are not clean men but deeply involved in scandals. The AFD still refuses to disclose the names of its donors. They want to hide what interests they really represent. https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/farage-europawahl-spenden-1.4455000…
"Yes, I wasn&#39;t allowed to appear in the official videos ..."
"Sorry to someone like Kurz who, for reasons of power, gives people like Strache responsibility, you can&#39;t strengthen your back."
"Find any collaboration with right-wing populists wrong &amp; always say that out loud. It&#39;s a good thing that new elections are coming to Burgenland. By the way, exclude that representatives of the Burgenland SPÖ speak at our rallies. Now the crucial question: what is the Union doing with Kurz?"
