"Affordable housing, better and free education and more mobility for everyone. Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel will tackle that as Prime Minister. If this is also important to you: both votes today for @tsghessen and the SPD! # ltwhe18 pic.twitter.com/SbtI7yVerF"
"I don&#39;t want medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe! Why is that important? Trump has announced that he is about to terminate a contract with Russia that has so far prohibited this. If you too are for peace, sign our call now: https://kein-wettruesten.de/"
"&quot;You can only understand life backwards, but you have to live it forward,&quot; said Kierkegaard. I now look back on 2018 a little wiser and full of confidence towards 2019. Happy new year for you and your loved ones! pic.twitter.com/tsH7L4drUr"
"250,000 people were on the streets in Berlin at the # indivisible demo - also for a strong Europe. I hope that they and the 81% in our country who are convinced of Europe will finally get as much attention as the screams from AfD, Pegida and Co. pic.twitter.com/Gl1yXl3nCL"
"I wish you and your loved ones relaxing, peaceful and happy holidays and a peaceful Christmas. I would like to express my greatest thanks and respect to all those who still work over the holidays and keep the shop going. pic.twitter.com/7FrhzGyRXX"
"How do we want to tackle cross-border challenges such as climate change, migration and tax justice? #europaistdieantwort. @katarinabarley knows that and she can get others excited about it. I am glad that she tops our list for the European elections!"
"My friend @TimmermansEU is the top candidate of European social democracy! His experience, passion and clarity are exactly what we have to oppose to the right-wing agitators, what Europe needs now. Veel succes, dear Frans!"
"November 11, 1918 warns us to stand up for peace in Europe and the world. This was preceded by 17 million deaths in a senseless and bestial World War I. We cannot allow nationalism to drive us crazy again! # ArmisticeDay100"
"Europe already makes sense on paper, but it has to convince the hearts to be successful. @katarinabarley can do both: she is an incredibly clever lawyer and she infects everyone in the room with her passion. She will be a great top candidate! #Barley"
"As Democrats, we have to make it difficult for the splitters. We have a shared responsibility: we have to preserve European democracy for future generations. That is why we have given ourselves 5 rules for the European elections across political groups: http://edition.faz.net/faz-edition/politik/2018-11-10/859cf14532d38480342242c587df8e0e/?GEPC=s9…"
"The Nazis systematically murdered over 6 million Jews in killing factories and left large parts of the world in ruins. Whatever is going on, whatever happens: you don&#39;t march with neo-Nazis. If you don&#39;t understand that, you should follow me. #unfollowme pic.twitter.com/acKPa6julu"
"November # 9 is a fateful day. I am proud that a social democrat proclaimed the republic 100 years ago. And with deep shame, how the Nazis pillaged and murdered 80 years ago. Let&#39;s defend democracy and never give the Nazis a chance again!"
"The carer @Alexander_Jorde has joined the SPD. His experience, passion and clear language will enrich us. His TV presence in the election campaign, with which he made nationwide aware of the shortcomings in nursing, was unforgettable. Welcome, dear Alexander! https://twitter.com/alexander_jorde/status/1056611576638255106…"
In Bavaria today you can choose cheaper rents and free daycare. So go to the ballot boxes and make two crosses for the @BayernSPD and @NataschaKohnen! #ltwby # LtwBY18
"Haddad now has the chance to gather Brazil&#39;s democratic and progressive forces behind it. I hope he can do it. The extreme right, authoritarian populist Bolsonaro must not win. It would be fatal for Latin America if Brazil tilts to the right."
I am happy for Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad and congratulate the Nobel Prize Committee on this outstanding decision. #Friedensnobelpreis
The fact that we were able to resolve the # Ehefüralle was one of the highlights of the election campaign for me. It is the success of those who have fought for decades with great personal sacrifices. I thank you and congratulate everyone who dared last year! pic.twitter.com/JF1mwQCLwq
