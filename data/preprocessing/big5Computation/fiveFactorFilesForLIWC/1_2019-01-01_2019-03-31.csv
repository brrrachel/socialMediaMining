"Moin, as if I had guessed your tweet: I met the organizers in the ministry weeks ago, went to the demo and let myself be whistled ... You can really see! :-)"
"As far as I can see, the Chancellor only welcomed the commitment of the young people - but said nothing about truancy! ‚úåÔ∏è"

"On the contrary, when you read my paper, you find that market economy &amp; competition are extremely important there. But it&#39;s about fairness and level playing field.

"Elections are free and secret. And that&#39;s good. For my part, however, I have always refused to make my decision dependent on a single question - however important it may be. Elections are always about making an overall decision."

Who said it would only be one?
Too bad that FAZ writes something wrong. I have always campaigned for #LSR AND for a 20 million exception for Art 13. Negotiator BMJV was unfortunately unable to achieve anything on Article 13 in the Council. Then at least wanted to save #LSR because there was a majority in Council and EP.
Who ever said that size alone is the answer ????? At least not me !!!!! #Industriestrategie
If internalization would happen in really ALL markets it would be highly welcome. But even without that we must step by step achieve it.

It has always been a pleasure to read your tweets! All the best!
I am always in favor of competition & innovation. But how to safeguard it against severe distortion by others on global scale? How to respond when global champions elsewhere are leading innovation & disruption?
"No question of belief: A railway company that is very, much larger than the railway division of Siemens, and also a monopolist on a huge market, is preparing its global expansion. That is his right. And we like this: lie down, wait or maybe?"
"At Siemens, the intervention consists in prohibiting the merger (all a question of perspective! :-). Possible consequence: emergence of a global monopolist from another country for large rail contracts (eg Turkey 30 billion)."
"@FuestClemens&#39; willingness to express criticism is always refreshing! But it&#39;s not about large U&#39;s as a principle: elevators in high-rise buildings, wide-body aircraft, rail systems for entire countries are ONLY built by large U&#39;s.

"The problem with infrastructure is not the lack of money, but the fact that existing money does not drain away. Black zero right, otherwise budget discipline will be gone. We can fool with investment instead of spilling if we have the courage to focus on spending."
"I totally agree. We have a close exchange with China and it has to stay that way. Kind and relaxed. And if we slept through the new technologies, we would be to blame ourselves ..."

"If I were scared I would not have made my serve :). I want to know where we stand as an economy and whether we are well positioned for the next 20 years. Incidentally, a global market economy only really works if everyone adheres to the rules."
"Good breakfast-meeting with @georgesoros: thx a lot for your support for Europe and our global values. We shall never accept anti-semitism, intolerance, populism!"
"At the World Economic Forum @wef in Davos this year a lot of interest in Germany. In view of #Brexit and many conflicts worldwide, we have to secure jobs and growth. In addition, I have more than a dozen discussions with state leaders and entrepreneurs worldwide."

"Sympathy, patience & readiness to wait until the UK‚Äôs position will be clarified are of utmost important to avoid the worst. They should not be misused for party politics. Large majority wants to exclude hard #Brexit - in the interest of the UK & beyond."
Some want to introduce referenda such as in the UK üá¨üáß or Switzerland üá®üá≠ in Germany. But what is it like when the population changes their mind later? And how can you tell if that&#39;s the case?

Hi Andrew! I am elevated because I see much more european spirit in the UK than I would have expected!
Finland is still relying on nuclear power plants and even building a new one. This is exactly why coal can be banned some years earlier. Like in France and in the uk by the way. https://twitter.com/HealthandEnv/status/1101431876298989568¬†‚Ä¶
The EU&#39;s ban on the Siemens / Alstom merger shows the urgent need for a European industrial strategy. It is about orders of many $ 100 billion worldwide. That&#39;s why we need a strong European champion. France &amp; Germany agree.

"Citizens&#39; energy won over 90% of the first tenders, unfortunately most of these plants have not yet been built. Hence the slump. The law was changed with the approval of the spd."
"It is the other way round: 1 trillion &quot;if we do nothing&quot; I said at the time. Then in 2013, against opposition from the SPD &amp; Gr√ºnen, I pushed through the auction model for EE. Since then, the costs have dropped enormously. This will save hundreds of billions by 2040!"
