"Again wrong thought, just left ..."
as well!
Because many left wing followers also follow me?
Then just READ the notes properly.
Then I could continue to run my business and my farm. 😉
It is probably murder and homicide and the many individual cases that justify scaring citizens and not the AfD program. Nice cheap trial ...
"For more security for life and limb, we ask you to use the protection zones to protect yourself from so-called protection seekers at the turn of the year in Cologne and elsewhere! #AfD #NoMultiKulti"

Of course it takes place every day in Germany! The daily reports in the media are just the tip of the iceberg. Slowly open your eyes and ears!

"Nothing else can be expected from your peers - primitive, primitive, bottom left."

"Unfortunately not, if there were enough rights outside, we would not need any protection zones and multi-cultural concrete barriers."
It is probably because your head is full ...!
Are you alluding to the many accommodations that foreigners themselves have ignited? Or the AfD&#39;s persistent stand against all violence?
Violent excesses again by &quot;seekers of protection&quot;! Culture enrichment in the sense of left anarchos? Let us hope that responsible left politicians will one day have to take responsibility. #AfD #NoMultiKulti https://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/amberg-nachrichten/nach-gewaltexzess-maenner-sind-in-haft-20847-art1734232.html…
"Yes and? Right-wing radicalism is legitimate, only right-wing extremism and, of course, the willingness to use violence should be clearly condemned. So what problem do you have?"
Protection of minorities and constant exaggeration are two different things. It just annoys people.
Just because we do not advocate the constant and compulsive exaggeration and overvaluation of minorities?
Cheap comment.
"no, is unknown to me"
well ...

Your humble opinion.
Can&#39;t you even differentiate between &quot;rushing&quot; and politically criticizing?
And the multi-cultural gossipers celebrate the violence at Christmas?

"Deputy Quade #Linke, himself a supporter of the violent #Antifa, repeatedly referred to the AfD faction in the plenum as anti-Semitic and ethnic fascists and anti-democrats. But once you wanted to &quot;put the #AfD argumentative&quot; - was probably nothing!"
It differentiates between radical and extremist!
You can see that you have no idea of the matter. Radical and extremist are not the same.
With the clear rejection of violence in the political debate? Nothing!
that&#39;s how it is

It is common knowledge that some statements for yesterday&#39;s and severely restricted link ideologists like you only allow one interpretation.

"Because, unlike the chaots, we are fighting violence in political discourse!"
"People also &quot;die&quot; in Germany, increasingly even through so-called refugees, so this is not an obstacle to returning home."
I even believe that as a left wing!

Again and again I speak against left-wing educational experiments such as &quot;writing by ear&quot; or inclusion etc. and for the maintenance of special schools.

"Exactly, such conditions make you particularly affected shortly after such a memorable day."

For example. since Antifa Nordost Berlin.
"I even go with it, related to left and right EXTREMISM."
Maybe there is no &quot;order&quot; at all? # Links stupid
"Yes, it&#39;s fine and yes, the left-wing miss in the video looks really desperate. The police just don&#39;t do anything bad ... but we&#39;ll do it anyway. Very meaningful and representative of Antifa &amp; Co., please share if you like."

It was also to be expected that you would want to interpret this in order to have an excuse for this left embarrassment.

You mean to leave cheap comments on other sites? But you do!

Sorry that some clear facts blinded left for conspiracy theory.
"But I am, even of direct democracy based on the Swiss model."
But not better either. Why are you patted anyway?
A left rag.
"You seem to have a huge lack of intelligence. Right is legit and left is legit. Violent extremism, no matter which side, it is not. Where and when did I write something else?"
"Exactly, of course that was the right ... 🤦🏼‍♂️"
The cornflower stands for old German patriotism and desire for freedom. Something else?
"It is surprising that you have no understanding of politics, given the fact that you are so clever ... You belong to the “Germany die faction”, right?"
"By the way, if you are not in the mood for left-wing shots and illegal mass immigration, you are not &quot;right&quot;, but normal!"
So what was wrong in my post? We all want to see if you can be reasonably factual.
"Yup, and they were there quickly ..."
Then I explain it to you: I mean the shift to the left over the past 20 to 30 years. Example? Merkel times: Multi-Kulti failed terribly (you were right); Merkel today: Multi-cultural is enrichment - understood? Or do you need a sketch?
"Are you laughing at yourself right now? I would join in, what do you think?"
Yes and further?
"Right-motivated crimes in SA down by 12%, what else?"
I have never been in a brown private life and why should my retreat stop left-wing extremism?
"You mean more in the &quot;belief&quot;, better in the left &quot;misbelief&quot;, because who exposes himself more than yourself through the left-wing provocative and insulting writing? Keep it up that helps me, the popularity is growing."

"Of course, and necessary!"
"Oh yes, for example in Switzerland."
"No, for direct democracy based on the Swiss model."
"Positive, should have lasted longer."
"1. Did I mention the attempt to democracy, did not praise the Weimar Republic 2. Was the SPD then completely different from today, Ebert was, for example, a patriot and spoke of a national community, etc. 3. Do not measure yourself up to me about national conservatism instruct."

So you mean the bearers of the blue flower in the fight against Napoleon? Are they supposed to be fascists? #linksirre
"So patriots should support the parties that want to abolish Germany? Oh, that&#39;s # stupid again."
But it shows that the state and media are apparently blind in the left eye.
"1. Right, 2. I didn&#39;t see a #Nazi there"
"If it doesn&#39;t suit you that Germans don&#39;t do this multi-cultural madness without contradiction, then please go very ..."

"Got something, but I don&#39;t know what ..."
But what exactly ...
"Others do that non-stop, we just make up for it."
Why should I keep calm?
Nothing planned at the moment.
"If it bores you, then it was a direct hit! Thank you for the confirmation."
But otherwise you have no complaints?
"Where and when should this have happened “everywhere”? Left liar, yes?"
Do you now mean left-wing educational and social experiments as “ideas” that do far more harm than good?
How would it be appropriate and who determines that?

"&quot;Today - would be - back then&quot; somehow problems of understanding, yes? # Links stupid"

"Thank you and also! Tomorrow, however, we will go out to lay the wreaths! ☝🏻"
"Who is talking about exploitation here? And do you actually know how many people have to work overtime? Left haze, right?"
"Dear @Joerg_Meuthen, there is only one honest alternative to this # EU juggernaut, namely: #DEXIT! Nevertheless, congratulations on the election as a top candidate. #AfD #NoEU #Poggenburg"
Are you talking about your own inability to differentiate between &quot;you&quot; and &quot;you&quot; in strangers? And please where do I constantly defend &quot;Western values&quot;? 😄
"You don&#39;t need specific information about age, hair color, etc. to clearly recognize the political motivation. Are you a bit # stupid?"
Exactly ... stupidity and irresponsibility! Just like your insolent attempt to relativise left-wing acts of violence.
"&quot;Creating&quot; as much as possible means: no more time for leftist fascist stupidities, that would help everyone in a positive way, right?"
Always too many!
"Anyone who is &quot;anti-fascist&quot; is not a left-wing fascist #Antifa, on the contrary!"

So first we have to distance ourselves and then the others? Who specifies this order? Your left-wing mind?

"Where does that prove that we insist on such members? Please explain if you can. These people are more likely to be forced to leave, unlike other parties that have and have had ex-NSDAP and NPD members. So we&#39;re excited ..."

"If you call those who think differently politically, who want direct democracy based on the Swiss model and immigration policy based on the Australian model, #Nazi, then you should trivialize National Socialism and spit it out in front of its millions of victims!"
This is more likely to apply to the fantasies of your Leninist and neo-communist clientele. We want direct democracy based on the Swiss model. That you refuse to do so exposes your clientele so wonderfully.
"Hitler greetings? How the Hitler Greetings in #Chemnitz with RAF signs on hand? Stupid again, what? Well, # stupid left"

"“Volksgemeinschaft” would be just as harmless. Has already been used a lot by Ebert (SPD). When I say this today, I am left opinion #Nazi. Something is settled # stupid left."
"It was clear to me that you, in particular, would be offended by my answer. But that&#39;s really left-cheap."
"They probably only react to constant Nazi allegations, hold up the mirror, but do not trivialize National Socialism."

"They may make mistakes when classifying them, but they do not trivialize National Socialism."
"So how radical left and extremist left in the left, Greens and parts of the SPD? Just for understanding."
"But other parties had and still have ex-NSDA and NPD members in their own ranks, but only the AfD today philosophizes with individuals with brown ideas. That is nothing but left hypocrisy!"
"You made a huge mistake again. I very well differentiate between left, radical left and extreme left. And just for info: on the left, I personally accept myself as a political direction."

"Yes, political reason alone has the color blue at the moment."

But why are you so clearly left? With history and danger?

It “means” and it “should” - BUT DOESN&#39;T do it in reality! Always the same with the left utopians. Was the same lyre with communism.
"Allegedly, conservative rights in Germany and the USA divide the people - that&#39;s wrong! Left-wing ideologists with experiments such as multiculturalism, gender and inclusion who want to change society completely and turn it upside down are the real splitters. #linkeSpalter #AfD"
Your extremely humble opinion.
Long and long before you.
"Exactly, for example about fear of foreign infiltration. This is of course HOSTILITY."
"Then please moderate yourself, okay?"
"But there were no &quot;arguments&quot;, only left agitation."
"Yes, I could take care of your left-primitive exaggeration and come with the KPdSU club etc. But I don&#39;t, I&#39;m not a constant rascal like you."
And left-wing agitators defend left charlatans.
"According to the University of Leipzig, &quot;xenophobia&quot; would have increased enormously - nonsense! This is what you get when you equate criticism of illegal mass immigration with xenophobia. Left charlatans instead of neutral scientists. #AfD #Poggenburg"
Your world? In which there is already a lack of minimum manners when approaching strangers? Who wants to take a look there?
The Lord has not noticed anything for a long time.
"Something like a left typing error, right?"
When and why should I?
"This is left nonsense and an awkward comparison! If there were actually Nazis at the head of the AfD, then you could bring the comparison like that. But it’s not like that. #linksdoof"
"If “your own lifestyle” can harbor a great deal of danger for others, you can generally reject it."
Let&#39;s say hello.
"You will have to ponder for a long time, will you?"
"You mean you&#39;re not let in as an illegal immigrant, right? It was also about the basic principle of &quot;generalize&quot;. This is used daily in all areas for security purposes and is completely legitimate."
"There is not so much choice, so where there is still something to &quot;destroy&quot;."
"1. After what their top people Habek, Roth &amp; Co. say about them completely true 2. yes, also"
"Didn&#39;t understand the connection? Not everyone is allowed to get a truck driver&#39;s license at the age of 16, because SOME are not yet that old, so it becomes a security measure: PAUSED"

It is generalized daily to ward off dangers and this is completely legitimate! Question: Why can&#39;t everyone get a truck driving license at 16?
"Drive home from rally and demo in Eberswalde / Brandenburg. Almost 300 participants were there. On the other hand, there were also numerous left-wing counter-demonstrators for the well-known pipe and howler monkey concert. #AfD #Poggenburg"
You mean more the crowd of lazy left spinners !?
"It is successful if you, as a new party, move in with every state election of 0 with a remarkable result!"
"But we are very successful for that, right?"
"Yes, the &quot;Republican trap&quot; really does exist and we are probably just entering it, but very differently than we thought! https://www.facebook.com/1079592458722716/posts/2436606636354618/… pic.twitter.com/JpnfZ6k9XW"
Perhaps because I myself am from the people and know a real working life outside of politics.
Educate people about the migration pact every day and do a good job of counteracting them everywhere!

"Exactly, that&#39;s how it is."
"More and more countries reject the #migration pact or, more correctly, the #peoples resolution pact. This has nothing to do with xenophobia, but with responsibility for your own people. Helping people to help themselves on site, instead of illegal mass migration! #AfD https://www.compact-online.de/bravo-kroatien-und-tschechien-lehnen-un-migrationspakt-ebenfalls-ab/…"
"1. Not of rights, but of violent right-wing extremists. The death threats are of course unacceptable, as is the mayor. 2. Yes, of course."
"Yes, it has always been this way in history, intolerance is wrapped in warm words and you try to justify it morally. But intolerance remained."
Then as an entrepreneur I am not a National SOCIALIST. So are we done with the left kindergarten?
"Of course, I thought that people who politically think dissident inflationary Nazis, whose peaceful events and expressions of opinion disrupt and want to prevent them, are simply intolerant. Logical, right?"
And when do you turn against Kommis? Or would you have to turn against yourself there?
"Right now letter salad with you again, right?"
You too? This demand ... but unfortunately no.
"Exactly, like you do such deeds still, right?"

By the parliamentary left-wing extremism committee and by definition left-wing extremism according to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
And every third with the old parties?
A little weak in the upper room? The fight against parliamentary democracy and for communism are rather the facts according to the protection of the constitution.
Left stupid or left primitive? I&#39;m still considering ...
Who says that? You have to listen and don&#39;t fool around on the left.
I didn&#39;t say either. But they work openly with left-wing extremist groups such as IL and VVN.
"No, why? We are right-wing or right-wing populist and against the use of violence. So what&#39;s the undifferentiated ramblings?"
"For your kind, it would only be a scandal, of course, only with right-wing extremism. #linkeHeuchelei"
"I have something against violent extremism, no matter what it disguises itself."
"Everyone, however, except of course AfD. It is not so bad that it is pacted directly with left-wing extremist groups."
Thank you very much and also!
Clear public sign against multi-cultural madness and the criminal consequences. We are fed up with murder and homicide as a result of illegal mass immigration! #AfD pic.twitter.com/gWF76xb3oB
Oh? Then you will be a little more precise.
"Oh, then Merkel does it &quot;unconsciously&quot;, even though it was so easy to predict? Then the woman would be weak in spirit according to your theory and should resign very quickly."
"Again from the series #linksbillig, yes?"
I would rather say that the mistakes are in your comment and not in the post. Do you think the name says it all?
They certainly said: &quot;Ridiculous comment again&quot;
But yes ... your comment surpasses everything in stupidity. And who was supposedly &quot;convicted&quot; by which Central Council for what?
"Maybe not that quickly, but the tendency towards the end of the Merkel era is becoming increasingly clear."
"A hideous crime! The &quot;shock&quot; of Chancellor Merkel, however, appears to be unbelievable, because it itself ensures increasing anti-Semitism in Germany by promoting Islamization. #AfD #GegenAntisemitismus #GegenIslamisierung https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute/merkel-erschuettert-ueber-anschlag-in-us-synagoge-100.html…"
"With us it may still be fermenting, of course the left manure troop is much wider."
Why is “sending home” against the rule of law and the Basic Law? Was the morning pint again extensive?
Says an old Stalin club and a left-wing incitement to the Lord ...
Criticism of the state and prevention of further political failure testifies to a sense of responsibility and not to mockery. The constant left relativizing and fine talking mocked the victims outrageously!
"Let us hope that we can prevent the repetition of the story and the red and brown camps! The violent “Red Guards” are already on the road again, as we did then, now we blue men will have to prevent the violent “Brown Hordes”."
"You mean like &quot;Germany die&quot; etc.? Oh no, I will not surrender to the commi speech of your kind."
"If anything, send it home! But how do you know about the alleged innocence? Against the background of innumerable document and asylum fraud, very unlikely."
"Well, &quot;right&quot; always means Hitlerism or Nazi, according to your own kind, vice versa, &quot;left&quot; automatically means Stalinism and Maoism. Or do you have another opinion?"
"Isn&#39;t it that bad that unions are pacting with left-wing extremists? Well, that&#39;s how Stalinists and Maoists think ..."
"If you learn to differentiate radically and extremist first, we will continue to speak."

"Plenary debate: #SPD thanks for the cooperation of unions, left-wing projects, the government, etc. with left-wing extremist groups such as #IL, # VVN-BdA etc. at the Bildungswochen Halle. No wonder the SPD is in total crash mode. #AfD"
So I only ever see mob like you!
"Level 1 reading book with you? Left, yes?"
"Center-left, but what does that have to do with the post?"
"Aha, so you admit that you made a mistake first ..."
Your extremely humble opinion ...

"Debate in the state parliament on November pogroms in 1938 and anti-Semitism: Leftists, Greens, SPD do not want to admit that illegal mass immigration and Islamization have fueled anti-Semitism in Germany. #AfD"
Again: where is something from Alsace quoted here? I don&#39;t see any activity from him here !?
And people sit in cars !? What kind of admission was that now?
Where did Elsasser quote here? Do you have perceptual disorders?
Can you read? And maybe you can even understand what you are reading? I wrote &quot;radical left&quot; and not &quot;extreme left&quot; for the Greens.
"What are you telling left garbage again? Who wrote anything about attacks on people? A house is first a thing, an object and that&#39;s what this was about. For example. &quot;painting&quot; of an asylum home."
You are the only howler!
"This is your insolent assertion, but nothing more."
What would you say if something like this was reported under attacks on refugee homes?
"Exactly, 41% increase in left-wing extremism in Saxony-Anhalt, that speaks for itself!"
Apparently yes!

"So 5000 isn&#39;t thousands? Do you have problems thinking more often? And you&#39;re left, right?"
Not just that. 😉
"My propaganda? Even the left press writes from 3000 to 5000 Pegida participants. You have now correctly delivered one. You just can&#39;t do anything, can you?"
"Well, you don&#39;t have to proclaim ignorance first, it is clearly in every word."
"Left wishful thinking! And &quot;right&quot; is just as legitimate as &quot;left&quot;, you should actually know."
"The left-wing extremist band @feinesahne Fischfilet is now supported by @anhaltisches Theater Dessau, since any art in general must not be suppressed. Will there be #Rechtsrock in Dessau soon, or how should the theater&#39;s statement be understood?"
1. Can you read? 2. Do you understand what you are reading? 3. Where do I have a “party symbol” on me?
Why shouldn&#39;t he look around? What does this have to do with me and which construction sites? Rumor has it that you are just a left troll !?
"Yes, of course, was there. There I found citizens who were fed up with Islamization, multi-cultural madness and left-wing extremism."
Left wing scholars abide by the Basic Law? That was good. 😂
Then you would have to pick up your kind with the bush drum.
Headwind? Rather monkey theater!
And your fear that National Socialism is ready to jump around every corner clearly shows how much your peers live the day before yesterday!
"That was a picture in between at the rest area with the cell phone, nothing more."
Where do you see any of this in my post? #LinkeHallos
"So you live firmly anchored in the day before yesterday, right?"
"At least something is going on in my head. Do you know otherwise, yes?"
Left stupid nonsense again !? Can you do anything else?
Do not have one.
"Event in Hamburg last night was great. However, when I saw the noisy, drooling and violent left-hand mob, I had to think of a renovation backlog. Because there must still be a lot of drinking water flowing through old lead pipes. #AfDwirkt"
"Such a nonsense again. If I put something as given and fact into the room, then I have found that to be real existing for me. So it was wrongly done here. There is only one previously unproven accusation against me, nothing more."
But just really ...
Which court allegedly found my bankruptcy? Left liar?
Missed the gray tones again? I differentiate!
"Exactly, regarding the major political weather situation."
He found it to be a claim.
"Well, you see, it is slowly ..."
"It&#39;s just nonsense again. For example, I have never called the FW &quot;left&quot;."
"Better than such a class pasper. You don&#39;t have to feel sorry for yourself, we feel sorry for you."
"And choke regularly, as everyone can read."
"Left-wing fascist in action. Keep it up, campaign for us!"
Better than stupid big asshole. Think about it as much as you can.
You would never figure that out yourself. So also mental stubborn cheek. Try again tomorrow.
Because we draw attention to this and want to help victims like you?
"But now you have almost got a mental knot, right? How big was the red guard who sat on the comment for an hour?"
"Maybe cheap, but your comment is, in contrast, quite worthless."
"Yes, so leave such comments, embarrassing."
"And you live the day before yesterday and you are still mentally caught up in WW2, right?"
Your comment is flatter. One could say below left.
"political stupid, yes?"
"Nationwide correction! A spelling mistake has crept into the slogan of a left-wing, nationwide campaign, probably due to increased educational deficits. We want to help correct this. So it is not #unpartisable but #unhealthy your #AfD"
"And you might think you are a left-winged utopian, we from the former socialist East recognize that immediately."
The Christian Suicide Union is not. 😄
But you&#39;re the radical bald man here!
Oh thank you for that ...
"Now, for example, a somewhat active election campaign."
Do you have to be afraid of &quot;left&quot;? Well when you say that.
"Then you probably don&#39;t know his statements about home, fatherland and &quot;red rats&quot;? Left and uneducated?"
All leftists who promote multiculturalism and Islamization in Germany are happy to accept these excesses as described in the article.
And what does the nonsense have to do with the content of the article? Left-wing stunners?
"Well, then you didn&#39;t address the stupid comments. What exactly do you want to know from me?"

Because you are a multi-cultural gossip and say that? I say exactly that to multi-cultural claps and that&#39;s it.
These are mostly left trolls if you address the stupid comments here.
I should &quot;piss off&quot; because such a small left-wing fascist wants that and doesn&#39;t get along with the truth? Keep dreaming.
You mean that with your utopian attitude you are unable to recognize cause and effect? Right!
"The left are committed to illegal mass immigration, multiculturalism and Islamization and are happy to accept forced marriages and rapes! This is called co-responsibility."

Whoever didn&#39;t understand anything here is obviously you. The post was about right and left and NOT center. Maybe UNDERSTAND now? Or do we still have to record it for you?
What do you want with middle now? The post was about right and left. Can you stick to it?
Will be the answer to daily left provocations.
Maybe to the Maoist? Not only the reference to the hashtag.
Why? Mark?
Then why are you discussing anyway? # Links stupid
Some now call everything racist that is not welcome gossip.
"That&#39;s right, somehow straightforward and accurate. It suits us."

So isn&#39;t that so? Then right does not automatically lead to Hitlerism and National Socialism? But why is every right permanently insulted as #Nazi in this country?

"Still, it was a bit stupid with feudalism, you don&#39;t have to mess around with it."
"Hundreds of thousands crossing the border without documents and &quot;seeking protection&quot; in Germany, although protection had long been found in other European countries, is: illegal mass immigration! Whether your left-wing mind tastes like it or not."
At least something could float there. Don&#39;t get too jealous. #linksdusslig
&quot;Illegal mass immigration&quot; is a fact and not an extreme right-wing concept of struggle.
When did I say &quot;lying press&quot;? Maybe completely wasted again?
"You should seriously consider the definition of “hostility”. If I criticize or reject something, I am far from being hostile to it. Here, from the left, there is again deliberately exaggeration and fear!"
Of course not from you.
"You uninformed left fool, I was attacked at the lecture by your peers and other left rags at Magdeburg University. Don&#39;t just read New Germany!"
"1. Bad, unfortunately there has always been difficult to prevent. 2. Bad, came a new one, easily avoidable without multi-cultural craze FINALLY CAPTURED?"
"You didn&#39;t get it, did you? It&#39;s not about the question catalog, but the left-wing marketing of the result! Even fear of foreign infiltration is not a xenophobia."
Evidence for something unproven? 😄
"The first part is correct, since we are always and constantly speak out against violence. Unlike your friends from Antifa &amp; Co., who like to “heat up”, for example with burning police vehicles."
"You can&#39;t do more than Nazi school, can you? # Left bright bag"
"Your timeline is really enough as an indication. Please go somewhere else, thank you."
I would not agree with that.
It was clear to everyone beforehand that you equate left-wing radical troll criticism of illegal mass immigration with xenophobia.
And wouldn&#39;t the left be something for you?
"No why, I stand by the AfD program and the rule of law."
Sensible left and extreme right? What world do you live in?
Says one of the SED successor party. 🤦🏼♂️
"And you are even unable to read !? Same question: new links, yes?"
"Says someone from the troop, which is sparkling red and rioting German streets in the fight for peace and against rrrääächts. # Left bright bag"
It is a shame for you that your attempt was so hollow that you now look stupid yourself.
"German universities are largely harbors of left-wing extremism, which must be dealt with with a strict national conservative hand!"
"Very sophisticated and constructive. New links, yes?"
running...
You are more likely to have poor eyesight when you can no longer see the violent left-wing mob. But you&#39;re probably right in the middle of it.
I see it the same way. But who do you say that to? With me there are neither.
"Exactly, I see the voters of the Greens regularly as drooling screaming necks with outstretched middle fingers on the counter demonstrations. At that point, nothing seems to be constructed for you !?"
On the howler monkey side? Good to know.

You want your Stalin again! Do not distract.
Not in the state parliament at least.
"Do you mean the people described in the Basic Law? And is that &quot;fucking and ominous&quot; for you? That says it all, another leftist anti-constitutional anti-constitutionalist."
"Well then it is probably also the states with a radical left-wing government that vote for the pact, right?"
"But you&#39;ve already read AND understood the post, yes?"
"Fortunately, some of them have woken up, and left-hand sleepers like yours will of course not happen."
Entertaining from time to time.
"No, because that would be irresponsible."
Having trouble reading or understanding? I called the left screaming chaots howler monkeys and not the &quot;much larger part of the people&quot;.
"nope, they just screamed around, as always"
👍🏻
A bit stale.
&quot;Mimimimi&quot; - again left level reading guide 1st class?
That is exactly what is far from them.
Great event in Möckmühl in Baden-Württemberg despite intolerant left-wing gestures. Thanks for the courageous invitation! #AfDwirkt http://www.afd.hn/p/poggenburg-701.html…

"Rape and knife attacks have been greatly increased by multi-cultural, who disputes the connection is a left charlatan!"
"What kind of left nonsense do you write? Of course, EVERYONE is not such a perpetrator, but the proportion in this group is so high and the resulting danger so great that a flat-rate protection must also be provided for the protection and well-being of our own people. Get it now?"
"Possibly yes, but completely undesirable."
"Then we&#39;ll leave it out, right?"
"Of course, as a directly elected member of parliament, that is not possible."
Exactly. #Rechtsruck
"Very reasonable from Austria! The migration pact is supposed to legalize illegal mass immigration and means the end of our social form. Further increasing sexual and knife crime, collapse of our social and health system, etc. ... #AfD https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article183030880/Oesterreich-Sebastian-Kurz-kuendigt-Rueckzug-aus-UN-Migrationspakt -an.html…"
"Nah, that was more of a couple of multi-cultural gossipers who were still enjoying it."
"Politically color blind, yes? BLUE is my home, you red sock."
"I can do it differently, in contrast to you. Always the same curd."
Left-silly perpetrator?
Left-hand rush.
Criticism of sexual assault by so-called refugees is &quot;baiting&quot;? Do you have any mental deficits?

"That sounds more like left-wing utopia, like communism or taking up half the world in your own country."
"Do you mean like the &quot;made up threat&quot; that if the words people, nation and patriotism are used frequently, National Socialism will break out of its own accord?"
Or do you mean the map of the asylum homes set on fire by so-called refugees themselves?
They haven&#39;t caused a G20 or anything like that in recent years.
And did not want to trade in the past.
You don&#39;t like it at all? Then I&#39;m doing everything right!
Rather in your head !?
In which dream world do you actually live? They have no idea about left-wing attacks and necessary security measures due to state-tolerated left-wing extremism. #bittemalaufwachen

"Violent left-wing extremism, yes."
But you still don&#39;t have to be one of the flicker lights like your own. 😉
"Our LeiDmedien analyze the #Rechtsruck in Brazil almost hostile and warn of all kinds of dangers. But where were the critical analyzes and warnings about the #Leftpress in Germany with all its intolerant, undemocratic and sometimes criminal consequences? #AfD"
"Exactly, at intolerant howler monkey tournaments, i.e. the left counter demonstrations to peaceful AfD events."
"You didn&#39;t get it again? If someone supposedly wants to do good, but actually produces bad things and beautifully pretends, that&#39;s hypocritical for me."
"Do you really understand reading? Where did I write that more and more Germans are agitating against Jews? Unfortunately, it is a fact that IN Germany is being increasingly harassed against Jews due to Islamization."
"Exactly, that&#39;s how it is!"
"Well, if you absolutely have to declare German as a &quot;Nazi language&quot; and subsequently pay homage to National Socialism, then there is no help for you. Please don&#39;t bother me on my side in the future."
"Tell us, you are the upper manure pumper here."
"Left-wing charlatans always want to justify their criminal multi-cultural madness by saying that there is no significant increase in crime by illegal mass immigration. This is a cheeky lie from left-wing pied piper, as the numbers make clear. #AfD #Poggenburg pic.twitter.com/OlBgWSPGyC"
"Hatred and violence tend to stir up your friends at #Antifa &amp; Co., also with the constant fear that all pol. Be dissenting #Nazis."

"Political accomplices are like you, namely wannabe good people, who campaign FOR the possibility of hateful daily # individual cases through their own multi-cultural craze."
"@ Jens7berlin is probably sitting in front of the screen all day, waiting for there to be legitimate criticism of acts of terrorism by multi-cultural groups in order to be able to rush left again. Poor primitive existence."
We didn&#39;t bring up the terrible # individual cases every day. They were more like you. You are politically responsible!
I&#39;ve never googled for it. What kind of ideas you have. People like you are ideological accomplices in everyday # individual cases.
Left-wing agitation as predicted! Any criticism of maladministration caused by leftist ideology must be declared hatred. Always the same primitive scheme. #linksbillig
The German with a migration background?
What&#39;s the nonsense? We have nothing against &quot;Right&quot;.

"In his speech, Striegel # Grüne describes the opponents of the extreme left-wing band &quot;Feine Sahne Fischfilet&quot; as the &quot;right-wing rabble&quot; ... With this #AfD, #CDU and countless conservative citizens have been clearly defamed again. These are the radical leftist Greens as we know them. #AfD"
There...
"Minister of Culture Robra could not or did not want to answer my plenary question directly, as he is now evaluating the intended event of the left-wing extremist and glorifying band &quot;Feine Sahne Fischfilet&quot; in Dessau. He would like to answer later, we can be excited! #AfD"
So far it doesn&#39;t really affect me. Link ideologues only believe your delusion.
So yes ... you are a trivialization of National Socialism. They should be ashamed of millions of victims.
How do you want to “know” anything !? 😄
What are you doing again? You can&#39;t murder a house any more than a car. &quot;Murder attempt&quot; ... just turn on your mind please.
"Yes, one sees more clearly every day."
"No, it is the original picture of the private property and of course the lady does not live in the warehouse."
And are you also such a left-wing trivializer of historical National Socialism?
Of course not. The fact that this has to be explained shows the state of emergency in the country. #Rechtsruck
Suppression of free expression through threats and attacks is anti-democratic!
"Oh, from where, the deed and not the color. Education instead of imagination."
"Well, left-wing activities often look sick, so I&#39;m absolutely right."
"No I did not. I compare attacks on a car with attacks on a house. Think, even if it is obviously difficult for you."
The only thing that doesn&#39;t work here is your thinking process.
"No he didn&#39;t, no they don&#39;t because of that. Any questions?"

"Oh, you can assume, but not others? I don&#39;t want nationalism, I want nationality. Has worked peacefully for decades, so where&#39;s your problem?"
"It may be that 13,000 were on the street against Pegida. But then not in Dresden. 😄"

The same applies to each party. Where is the real statement now?

Do you mean the justified criticism of conditions like yours? Still coming
"Well, you see, you can at least expect something from a &quot;right-wing politician&quot;, on the other hand, it looks very different."
"Of course, it is flatter than flat, as you have demonstrated impressively."
"And you don&#39;t have any left, just left."
"Wide awake, even without brown coffee."
"Congratulations to @AfD_Bayern for the strong first entry into the state parliament! Finally there are patriots in the Bavarian parliament again, Franz-Josef Strauß would be thrilled. 🇩🇪"
Even residual alcohol?

"I never cry, don&#39;t infer yourself from others."

Green herring?
You mean: left-wing incitement?
"No, German Democrats, so we are not responsible for this, unfortunately left-wing multi-cultural celebrations are."
For you: # incurable
You have to ask that yourself. Hardly understandable for a normal thinking person.
Also weak in understanding reading? Left?
Read again exactly what I wrote.
"Who did this hollow answer come from, please?"
And you?
Everything great.
"So I already differentiate between left-wing, populist, left-wing radical and left-wing extremism. Conversely, the other side cannot, as you can see from the article."
"You didn&#39;t understand the term populism, did you?"
Then some tuition for you: Even a party leader has and ultimately cannot classify me as an “extreme right”. This could possibly only be a court or the VS through appropriate actions.
This is private. 😉
And that&#39;s what leftist utopians say! 😄
"From a legal point of view, I &quot;may&quot; call each party fascist, what should that say?"
"It has been observed by the VS for a long time, as far as I know."
"The Hamburger @abendblatt needs a tutoring on extremism! I am not observed by the US, and there have never been proceedings against me for sedition etc. I am an avowed right-wing populist, but not a right-wing extremist. #Poggenburg https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article215551375/AfD-Mitte-laedt-als-extremistisch-geltenden-Redner-ein.html…"

"From zero to two digits in the state parliament is a win, even if the left wing does not fit."
"No, only at the rest area. But I also speak to the Greens when it matters. I&#39;m not an intolerant preacher of tolerance like that."
Good but unbelievable.

At eye level? How far must your wife lower then?
"No, because a suspicion is just a suspicion. Very strange and useless question."
"I wouldn&#39;t even say that Mr. Kavanaugh was a rapist because he was just publicly accused, nothing more."
"I do not need it, it has already been sufficiently pointed out on all sides, as your question confirms."
"And you would like a central EU based on Stalin&#39;s model of the former Central SU, right? No, we will prevent that!"
What kind of curd cheese are you talking about here? Are you perhaps a racist?
"And then should we wish you a man who accuses you of sexual assault, even if you have not done so, and thus destroys your professional and family life? Would that be for you, yes?"
"I&#39;m sorry, but I see it differently, as do those who chose him. Of course, rape is not a trivial offense, but here the allegation has apparently only been used for politics."
What a stupid leftist you are. You have nothing else what?
What are you a dumb Stalin freak?
And for years the lady would have had more time to make her allegations. That was a cheap spectacle!
Then we will point out the suspicion.
"And for you, nobody has to be properly judged first? You&#39;re such a fan of the #Volksgerichtshof, right?"
"Judge #Kavanaugh in the US confirmed that this is good news and a major blow to the left-wing liberal squad. And the allegedly inflated rape allegations did not work either. Good thing, because you can&#39;t do politics with something like that."
"Watch the news, tweet and compose a few more emails."
Rather because the workers are turning their backs on the unions. 😄
"But you already know that we are here on Twitter and not in a book publisher !? A tip: you&#39;d better correct the spelling of your left wing, then come back to me, yes?"
It was just a description of the situation. Should I have said dishonestly: &quot;stimulated discussion&quot; when there was peace? Courage to truth!
Specifically to your leading question: no
You mean by speaking the German language? I&#39;m sorry if the Nazis used them too. But that won&#39;t stop me from saying what I think today.
"The new left ideology of social experiments such as multi-cultural at any price, gender nonsense, inclusion, etc. is just as crazy as the earlier left-wing fairy tale of communism."
"Aha, you are such a left-wing yesterday. You couldn&#39;t do it without #Nazi, right?"
But maybe you see it that way because YOU have long since been manipulated on the left? Think about it.
"At yesterday&#39;s #AfD faction dialogue faced the accusation that we were constantly doing &quot;stir up fear&quot;, I replied: Fear was stirring up the left forces, who constantly invoke the demon of National Socialism to justify their insane ideology. Afterwards: calm #AfDeffects"
Because we are exposing left-wing extremism? Explain times.
And you have no idea about the definition of extremism?
Actually not at all...
I like to believe that you are a left-wing extremist!
Do you have any experience?
"Press conference # Left-wing extremism with knowledge from the left-wing extremism inquiry: Landeszentrale für pol. Education, leftist groups, trade unions and togetherness e.

"No, the disrespectful behavior and a head of state that makes up for it. What does that have to do with skin color?"
"Oh, that I get so much attention in the presence of Macron. All attention."
Of course not and that&#39;s the difference.
"Very big, deep, left level!"
Where is there a head of state that makes the statement common? #understood nothing
"An assignment according to appearance is not &quot;racist&quot; at all, since it contains no rating or assessment at all, you left lamp ..."

"You “don&#39;t have to” read anything, but thank you for being interested in my site. Even if their left-wing comments are difficult to bear for non-utopians."
"Then would you explain the racist part behind it? You mean the underpants, yes?"
"Please, what exactly was racist?"
Do you know the difference between right and right terror? And don&#39;t you have to wait for a judgment first?
"No, but about some comments! 😂"
"There is nothing of the Caribbean in the picture, so what is the clumsy agitation?"
But it really depends on the &quot;how&quot;! And I am not making myself common with the invaders&#39; terrorist methods.

And right ...
"1. we are still &quot;you&quot;. 2. What is this stupid claim? 3. Of course, I totally reject a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; that wants to perpetrate attacks on foreigners."
"That&#39;s rubbish! It is about the constant exaggeration at metoo, corresponding laws had existed long before."
If moral apostles fail on themselves! The hypocrisy of (new) left-wing campaigns cannot come out more clearly. All the exaggerated howling and transparent moral drooling annoys righteous people.

All good...
"Rather mixed, for example as a cyclist or diesel."
"You should be ashamed of yourself! They want a criminal justice system à la People&#39;s Court, where the accused is convicted without having been proven beyond doubt. #neulinkeIdeologie"
How did they stop this? By even turning on the FBI? Tell me exactly.
"And what would be right-wing conservative in the US, comparable to Germany?"
I understand you correctly: You also reject the presumption of innocence and would rather like a dictatorial criminal justice system?
"I did not &quot;look down&quot; either, but spoke of the same problems."
But no...
"So the United States has (still) the same problem: shrill activists who cheer up the rape card and reject the presumption of innocence, left-wing liberal leaders at various points who reinterpret the constitution. https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article181783348/Oberster-Gerichtshof-Trump-und-Kavanaugh-stehen-vor-einem-near-historischen-Sieg.html…"
