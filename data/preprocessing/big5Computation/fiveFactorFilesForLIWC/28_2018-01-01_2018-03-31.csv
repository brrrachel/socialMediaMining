The right to religious freedom is not &quot;the right&quot; but part of it. And this part has barriers.

The same applies to religious freedom. A religion that aims to eliminate the FDGO would not be covered by religious freedom. And now you: Which Islamic school is compatible with the constitution?
Apparently she doesn&#39;t understand what digitization means.
"I&#39;ll try again for you: freedom of association is a fundamental right. However, it does not apply to a general assembly against the GG. Freedom of expression is a fundamental right. And yet there are limits. Eg the dignity of your fellow human beings is called insult, etc"

Any interpretation of Islam directed against the Basic Law in its existence is not covered by religious freedom. And now please list the schools of Islam that comply with the constitution. That is exactly what belongs to Germany.

Compliance with the constitution is a prerequisite for freedom of religion. That is exactly what is currently a major Islamic problem.
That&#39;s why you fled to Berlin straight away.

You should seek help from the Federal Constitutional Court to assist in interpretation. This helps!

"Goals yes, but hope is no basis for politics. It has nothing to do with alarmism. I also hope to see Merkel. But I don&#39;t rely on it, so not at all. ;-)"

The term ‚Äúactivists‚Äù should be avoided in this context.
"@EvaHoegl appeared twice. The first time was apparently sufficient as an entry ticket for a ministry, the second time after less than 24 hours in office. The woman has potential. Did anyone think that the SPD would go uphill after leaving Schulz?"

About half of the Muslims living in Germany consider democracy to be less essential than Islam. Is it ethnic? Certainly not. Is that due to religion? I mean yes and no. Is it cultural? I absolutely mean yes!
It is really so banal that we should slowly come to the critical questions on which we have dissent.
The answer would shock you. It would be easier for some people if no differentiation had not been refused for years.
Don&#39;t you think there are cultural rejections to these rules?
"Unfortunately, I have to put an end to this at the moment."
"Not all, of course, and not entirely."
"Right, that was also a cultural phenomenon. Fortunately, we have overcome this culture. And that&#39;s why I warn against the return of a comparable culture. Cultures are not equivalent per se. They even contradict elementary basic values of our community."
This is 95% consensus for people from our Central European culture. We both have no dissent.
"The Arab states are, without exception, intolerable communities. What do you attribute this to? Climate? Ethnicity? Bad luck? I think it&#39;s a cultural phenomenon."

"Dear Frank, Racism (as Meuthen clearly called it) is punished with a warning in the AfD. Racism is one of the few flawless reasons for exclusion. In this respect, the AfD also has a problem."
That works and is again a storm in a glass of water.
What is worse is that there is no longer a contradiction. Even the formerly ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Uwe Junge now wants to ‚Äúhold ignorant people accountable‚Äù and is developing into a case for the protection of the constitution.
Is the FDGO independent of culture? And why does it only occur in European culture and with restrictions in Asia?
Not at all!
"But whether one can argue about gay rights, women&#39;s rights etc. in such a relaxed manner? Maybe even democracy or dictatorship? I doubt it."
"Nobody knows what it looks like beforehand. But maybe we agree that one can generally prefer cultural monogamy, but for other reasons also polygamy. You will have to agree if you think about pension consequences etc."
"Culture does not only mean folklore but above all it gives rules for the coexistence of a community. If several cultures exist side by side, there are also many rules, sometimes contradictory. Ultimately, a common culture emerges."
"So I know of such demands from very few outsiders. But yes, they do exist. Is that your biggest concern right now? Do you see any cultural dimension apart from the ethnic dimension? As a US expert, you should recognize the differences to D."

So I realize that it is part of Arab culture that homosexuals and women enjoy full rights. Just as democracy is part of Arab culture. That&#39;s new to me now.
"So, if the principles are universal, are all those who think that women&#39;s rights contradict their culture are wrong? I am looking forward to this debate if you are having a Saudi. :-)"
"I didn&#39;t attack you for that. I asked what if the experiment you outlined didn&#39;t work. Incidentally, multi-ethnicism is not an experiment but a reality in all states except Japan and Iceland."
