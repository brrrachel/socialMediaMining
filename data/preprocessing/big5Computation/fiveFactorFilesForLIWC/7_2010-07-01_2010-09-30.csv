"@Lanzenheim would be nice, but Mr. Carstensen is considered a black Pinoccio because he constantly &quot;unfortunately can&#39;t keep his word&quot;."
"Carstensen is the politician who can be marked in red on the calendar if he keeps his promise. # Election fraud: daycare, UKSH, school"

@c_vogt they scoff only for the little time you still have in the state parliament! Wagenburg statement by your boss spoke volumes today! CDU is already fleeing!
"@c_vogt do not worry, we will settle it soon, if you are not playing for time in new elections - but you fear choice and 5% hurdle!"
@c_vogt With this attitude you have already dropped to 5% within one year - just keep it up!
SH wants SPD-led government and policy change! New elections on a constitutional basis within a year! Whoever stonework will pay!
NDR survey: gaining confidence for the SPD (+ 7%) and blatant loss of trust for the CDU / FDP (37% against 51% red-green) and executive government.
