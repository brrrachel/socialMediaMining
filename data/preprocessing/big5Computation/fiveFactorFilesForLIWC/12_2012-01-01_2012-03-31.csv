@maltewelding 1999 first lieutenant? Where should I have written that. And from 1997 to 2004 I was successfully self-employed.
@Fison Completely different issues. And the one that concerns me is not even spelled out correctly. Comes back every few years.
@sven_kindler @volker_beck Relieving cold progression means avoiding automatic tax increases through inflation: justice.
@Fison negative campaign? Nice try. But read the background on my website before you spread such a thing.
@trichers That was a funding program that our investor used for venture capital.
@MTPei Is it about &quot;scoring&quot; - or about making the right decisions? Was OPEL wrong then?
"@urmelmann @vilstal is that easy? And because of savings banks and comrades, we have a different structure than anderso."
@wolske_? The SPD in my constituency had about the same number of members.
@Volker_Beck gimmick. I have doubts. But I stand by coalition appointments. Childcare allowance is not a question of conscience.
@frontmotor Puh - now eight years old propaganda. What has that got to do with factual politics? Facts about this on my website.
@_vielflieger_ Schlecker? There is also solidarity with the employees if you trust the BA and not a state transferge.
@LOB_ComBridge I think: work is better than unemployment. 3 instead of 5 million. Red-green Agenda 2010 is better than its reputation.
"@Volker_Beck propaganda. The end of the cold progression is no tax increases. Because: Despite additional income, more debt in NRW."

Gauck: &quot;I will listen to people when they are afraid. But I will not intensify these fears.&quot; So freedom instead of fear.
@JoKnopp Also: Was Streetview IT afraid? Or protection of privacy? Network culture is not necessarily post privacy.
@lostgen Is that IT fear? Or protection of privacy. Network culture is not necessarily post privacy.
@JoKnopp Much lower for IT. See spread of smartphones.
Gauck especially at the FDP: &quot;I suspect fear as a political leitmotif. We have to overcome the reserve against freedom.&quot;
"@alrightokee smartphones, Facebook etc. show that there is rather no fear of IT. A certain CDU MP is not a yardstick for me ..."
@EvaMathar Can&#39;t there be several topics that are equally important?
@SaskiaSaskwatch Nah! Overall technology is with me. I wanted to differentiate the fear of technology. There is not a blanket in D.
"@sweinmann Sure. Even back then, a newspaper wrote about my visit to an unemployment initiative in Munich."
"@MHQuerdenker: With Ron Paul, the boundaries between liberal, libertarian and neoconservative seem to me to be blurred. Would be with Obama."

"@sweinmann In any case, I don&#39;t think in terms of class and class struggle."
@sweinmann You have to apologize o compensate immediately if you meet medium-sized companies who do business honestly and work. create?

Gauck has impressed me several times with speeches on the value of freedom. The FDP has cleverly set the course for its cross-party election.
