@ MariamLau1 @sauerkreatur and lastly: all this supposed cross-front chattering of the Journis makes AfD and worse worse for discussion.
@ MariamLau1 @sauerkreatur the AfD represents nationalist-protectionist positions vis-√†-vis the USA and the EU - nothing works - again!
@ MariamLau1 @sauerkreatur such nonsense. We criticize the EU (not Europe) and the USA from an anti-militarist / civil law perspective
@ MariamLau1 there is nothing! There are no similarities with the AfD&#39;s anti-democrats and social chauvinists.
