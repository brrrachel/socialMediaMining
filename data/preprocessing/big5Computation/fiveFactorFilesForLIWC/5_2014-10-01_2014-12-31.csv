@ BelaAnda1 No answer is also an answer! PS You warmed up debate days after my tweet.
@ BelaAnda1 Did he come to BILD? Or did you invent the demand and then look for someone who parrots. You dodge!
@ BelaAnda1 Do you still answer a question? Why BILD invents claims and then looks for politicians who parrot for a headline?
@ BelaAnda1 I&#39;ve been a member of the German Bundestag for 14 years. BILD stopped trying to win me over for invented things ten years ago. You 2004: Government spokesman
@wolfwitte Exam: Driving voting booths. Decided: referendums
@ BelaAnda1 I always hung up on these BILD calls. Was the best recipe.
@wolfwitte Doesn&#39;t need any corner points. Is even in the basic program. GG change necessary. Does not go against 42% CDU / CSU
. @ BelaAnda1 Is this serious journalism if you invent claims at BILD and then make calls until someone half bites?
"@wolfwitte Well, my party supports referendums. Ms. Merkel, on the other hand, gets good election results with which she prevents this"
