The right to asylum is being increasingly reduced. Combating the causes of flight is only a side note to the heads of state and government. It is the only way to effectively reduce the number of refugees. The European idea is being damaged more and more every day. #EUGipfel
"Politics should contain a minimum of logic. If the federal government determines that you have to earn at least € 12.63 full-time for 45 years to receive a pension above basic security, a minimum wage of € 9.19 is nothing more than a poverty wage."

It is the task of all the left to submit proposals for eliminating the causes of flight. Every 14th minute a person dies from a German weapon. We earn from wars. Arms exports to non-NATO countries have increased by 47%. That is out of the question. https://t.co/Tttnedrwpy
