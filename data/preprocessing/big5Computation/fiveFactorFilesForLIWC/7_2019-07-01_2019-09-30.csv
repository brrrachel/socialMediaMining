Yesterday evening at the meeting of the former full-time managing directors of the SPD. Good conversation and a very nice evening in Berlin.
"All of this shows that election campaigns are worthwhile. The task list for the federal SPD is full: clear profile as a left-wing People&#39;s Party, where you know what we stand for. The competition for the programmatic + personal line-up of the SPD, which begins the day after tomorrow in Saarbr√ºcken, can begin!"
In Saxony we had a harder time because the polarization towards right-wing radicals worked in favor of the shrinking CDU. The election result of the courageously fighting SPD with Martin Dulig is disappointing and yet there will probably be a stable government with SPD participation.
"Thanks to a committed election campaign by a united SPD with Dietmar Woidke at the top, Brandenburg managed to ensure a stable government led by the SPD despite losses."
"Today we deal with the difficult election results in Brandenburg and Saxony in the Presidium + party executive of the SPD. At the same time, the final sprint succeeded in ensuring stable governments and preventing the triumph of the (far too strong) right-wing radicals."

"Election campaign is worthwhile: In Brandenburg and Saxony, the feared dominance of right-wing radicals has been prevented. In Brandenburg this was done by Dietmar Woidke and the SPD, in Saxony in favor of the CDU - it was difficult for Martin Dulig and the SPD."

Tackling the blatant inequality of distribution is a (socially) democratic compulsory task in a country as wealthy as Germany. Therefore: higher taxation of the largest incomes and assets to finance future investments for our community!
"If companies have been hit on the wall, workers are laid off, stock prices after &quot;restructuring&quot; and &quot;releases&quot; rise and failed managers are &quot;rewarded&quot; with top severance payments, then you learn something about &quot;service providers&quot;."
"The real performers of our society are the hard-working people in occupations in which they are sometimes paid far too low: industrial workers, nursing staff, sales assistants, police officers, educators, bus drivers, waste workers ... not the top earners!"
The SPD will present a concept for the reintroduction of property tax. It is overdue. Those with the highest incomes and wealth have to contribute more! #TeamSwanStegner #PassionateRealSocial Democratic

"In any case, it is always interesting to ask about the motives if the interest of the parliamentary committee of inquiry regarding the rocker affair is to be hindered or counteracted."
A joint attempt by the state government and the CDU to restrict the SPD&#39;s right to ask questions and information in the parliamentary committee of inquiry on the rocker affair and to impose muzzles will be vigorously opposed and with all legal options.
"With his sympathy for the rights, Mr. Maassen is politically unacceptable. The fact that the party leader @akk is called back by her general secretary Ziemiak speaks volumes about the situation in the Union."

I am a fan of the HSV. Schalke 04 is also a great football club. The supporters and fans of this club did not deserve a supervisory board chief like this Mr. T√∂nnies.

"The problem is not that problematic events become public, as Prime Minister G√ºnther complains, but that they do exist. This is even important in democracy, even if it is uncomfortable for the government. That is, for example, the task of independent media."
"When the Minister of Justice publicly says that everyone is equal before the law - this also applies to politicians, journalists and trade unionists - in context this acts more as a warning or threat not to rely too heavily on the legal protection of professional secret service providers. #Durchsuchungsbeifang"
"Exciting cover stories on police and justice in Schleswig-Holstein. Contrary to false CDU claims, the SPD does not criticize judicial decisions or independent judiciary, but rather questionable statements by the Justice Minister and the circumstances surrounding searches."
Every vote for Martin Dulig and the Saxon SPD is a vote for a stable Saxon government that does not become dependent on right-wing radicals. #SPD
