Cold winter morning in the north. Icy wind from the east during the market before breakfast.

"During the energy turnaround, the black traffic light oversleeps wind power planning, endangers jobs, takes a municipal electoral moratorium and tries to remove the prime minister from the line of fire of his broken election promises by removing responsibilities."
"The SPD parliamentary group has requested special meetings of the interior and legal committee and the social committee. On the one hand, it is about clarifying victim protection issues surrounding a former ‚Äúvictim helper‚Äù of the White Ring. The other is about youth welfare and an act of violence."
In the evening I visit the SPD district association Segeberg. Discussion with the district board and local association conference in Kaltenkirchen.
"We are also debating the diesel scandal. It is about consumer protection, air pollution control, jobs and pressure on the industry that low-emission cars are not only built in Japan and China."
Today plenary session of the state parliament with a current lesson on the topic of &quot;affordable housing&quot; The SPD supports the popular initiative for affordable housing in Schleswig-Holstein. The black traffic light oversleeps the topic like many questions that are about social issues or good work.

"Basic solidarity income is a voluntary concept with good work. On the other hand, everyone should get a subsistence minimum without sanctions and conditions.

Hardly likely! I am expressly not in favor of an unconditional basic income! This is severance pay with a nuanced nomenclature = social transfer benefit.

"Nonsense. Overcoming precarious employment, more collective bargaining and improvement of minimum wages and low wage areas are part of this for me.

"Everyone unconditionally receives a living wage, we introduce basic child protection and everyone can get a solidary basic income for good work on the social labor market (social security + minimum wage) and has an opportunity account = modern welfare state for the digital future."
"There is enough work for the community. Paying a minimum wage that is subject to social security contributions, i.e. a basic income based on solidarity, as suggested by Michael M√ºller, is much better than compensation for the social benefits ‚Äúunconditional basic income‚Äù."
"In the digital world of work, we need welfare state reforms. Social labor market with a basic income based on solidarity (minimum wages + social insurance), basic child protection and an opportunity account - these are building blocks of modern social policy beyond the old Hartz IV subsistence level."

What a great party: weeks of serious and passionate debates with an appreciative diversity of opinions about the future of our country and Europe as well as our SPD. Then hundreds of thousands vote and decide with a clear majority. You can&#39;t get more democracy!

"The public debates about the situation at the CDU and SPD are conducted with a southern temperament. Not everything you hear and read like this has to do with reality. In any case, where personal individual interests predominate, caution is advised."

"Many interviews yesterday, among others in the ARD &quot;Tagesthemen&quot;. Also today radio interview at NDR Info, before I go to the SPD district party conferences in Ostholstein in Bad Schwartau and Pinneberg in Elmshorn."
Now there must be an end to any personnel debate until the members of the SPD have decided on the coalition agreement! After that there is enough time to deal with personnel issues. I hope that we see yesterday as the last warning and use it for a fresh start!
"Yesterday was a difficult day for the SPD. Once again, completely unnecessary discussions about personnel in public have replaced the content that should be the focus of the member vote."

Nice polemic but nonsense. It&#39;s not about trying to talk the CSU out of its party propaganda - we don&#39;t care. The point is that the SPD is not again incorrectly assumed to agree to an upper limit that we would never agree to (reading helps!) Https://twitter.com/alexbercht/status/959679443664080896‚Ä¶
"The fact that our members can decide on the coalition agreement, that we discuss party reforms in the party (including original election proposals), that our delegates to the Federal Party Congress have the last word, all of this shows the strength of the modern participatory party SPD."
"As far as refugee numbers are concerned, the CSU cannot be denied its idiosyncratic view of the world. The fact remains that the SPD has not agreed to an upper limit and will not do so either. It is agreed that we will not be used for that."
"Not the SPD members, but the one who constantly claims the opposite of what is in the text. https://twitter.com/alexbercht/status/959784143977631744‚Ä¶"

"Reading has to be difficult. The text provides an assessment of what is likely to be expected based on past experience, that is all. There is no question of not wanting more than 180-220000 (that would be an upper limit). If necessary, fight the causes of flight! https://twitter.com/alexbercht/status/959745267342987265‚Ä¶"
"There is also no political cap. There are certainly limits to a society&#39;s ability to integrate.

"Not to mention the question of what would happen to Europe in a government of black, yellow and green."
"Exploratory talks only provide interim results for questions as to whether it is worth entering into coalition negotiations. But: Improvements for people at work, pension, education, families mostly in other government constellations such as black and yellow or black traffic lights unthinkable!"

Now we have to decide which is better: mandate to continue negotiating with the Union and in the end our members will decide on the result (I promote that) or on the way to early elections.

"No progress so far with taxes, citizen insurance, unfounded fixed-term contracts. Union propaganda: We have definitely not approved any upper limit for refugees because we neither restrict nor undermine asylum law and the Geneva Refugee Convention!"
"Just as my basic skepticism against a large coalition has remained, the interim balance remains mixed: a lot of progress in education, care, parity in health insurance, Europe, work, immigration law, pensions, and much more."

The SPD is now discussing whether it is worth entering into coalition negotiations with the Union or looking for a more or less direct route to opposition and new elections. That will be decided by the Federal Party Congress next Sunday.
Yesterday guest speaker at the New Year&#39;s reception of the Bremen SPD. Today back to Schleswig-Holstein.
"With the closed SPD team, we made good progress in exploratory talks led by Martin Schulz and I really think that coalition negotiations are worthwhile on this basis. But if they just ratify exploration, we wouldn&#39;t need it and membership decision."
Negotiations will not bring fundamentally different results. But of course there must be more in some important points if the members are to agree in the end. CSU loudspeakers and some false claims shouldn&#39;t itch us at all.

"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today continues to prepare for the exploratory talks with the Union beginning tomorrow. Remain very skeptical about another grand coalition. In the meantime, CSU is doing everything possible to thoroughly underestimate such things."
Good morning from Bordesholm. My music tip for you out there in digital orbit is from Lou Reed - &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; Have a nice weekend ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrMLt9bMd_I&amp;feature=share‚Ä¶
There are completely different parallel societies than is commonly claimed .... https://twitter.com/jagodamarinic/status/949254179209580545‚Ä¶
"What is wrong with you You&#39;ve had an intellectual losing streak for weeks. So to take notes: In contrast to Seehofer and Orban, Sigmar Gabriel meets his foreign minister colleague (is his job?!) And does not invite him to the SPD party conference for spiritual orientation. https://twitter.com/hugomuellervogg/status/949253862342447104‚Ä¶"
"Read with enthusiasm in the morning press, who thinks that everything must be publicly admonished to the SPD before the exploratory talks @jensspahn @KonstantinNotz #Dobrindt If only @c_lindner is missing then the Jamaica Dream Team would be complete. Too bad that @heuteshow pausesüòâ"
"In view of the known agreements of the Jamaican soundings, which failed in the end for other reasons, this is a remarkable expression of courageous dialectic, if not political amnesia. https://twitter.com/burkhardwert/status/949180547661729793‚Ä¶"

"In the meantime, the CSU is muscling, stuck in the semi-strong verbal radicalism and once again invites its authoritarian buddy and the advocate of &quot;illiberal democracy&quot; to the Hungarian ruler Orb√°n for their retreat. Any further comment is probably superfluous."
Preparations continue today. Various talks and switching conferences. In the evening the New Year&#39;s reception of the municipality of Bordesholm.
"The SPD prepared intensively, seriously and professionally yesterday for the exploratory talks with the Union, which should begin the day after tomorrow."
Good morning from Berlin. My music tip for you out there in digital orbit is from Bob Dylan - &quot;A hard rain&#39;s gonna fall&quot; Happy Friday ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5al0HmR4to&amp;feature=share‚Ä¶
Closed meeting of the SPD exploratory team to prepare the exploratory talks with the Union will be completed on Sunday after twelve hours of deliberations. So it won&#39;t be back to Schleswig-Holstein until tomorrow morning.

In the evening it goes back to the north.
"Today closed meeting of the SPD exploratory team before the exploratory talks with the Union begin next Sunday. The Union has clearly failed with its ‚ÄúJamaica explorations‚Äù. In this respect, it is astonishing what big notes you are spitting at the CSU."

"Through the Twitter egg from Storch, Weidel &amp; Co. the right-wing extremist attitude of the AFD agitators is once again offered to all those who still believe that this is a normal or democratic party. #NieWiederRechts"

Great cinema and brilliant journalism https://twitter.com/andreasschoepf/status/949049498910773248‚Ä¶
"Today first talks and media appointments. Later to Berlin. Internal preparation for exploratory talks with the Union, which will start on Sunday."
"Nonsense. Exploratory talks only clarify the question of whether coalition negotiations are worthwhile. The actual negotiations can be found there and the following applies: nothing is agreed before everything is agreed. So no improvements, but negotiation goals. https://twitter.com/tomasboeck/status/952233461640724480‚Ä¶"
