"What a breakthrough & success for all of us: The EU Agreement with Argentina/Brazil/Paraquay/Uruguay will increase welfare & employment, stabilize global markets & enormously strengthen the idea of multilateral rule-based trade! Thx & congrats to @MalmstromEU & @JunckerEU !!!"
You&#39;re right: the train connections should be better!
"I expressly disagree with this gentleman‚Äôs view of the climate. I just wanted to point out that giving up flying is just not that easy. For example, if the train journey is twice as long."
Habeck and I can still fly because business trips are paid ... Others are worse off ...
Green politicians are people like us. We cannot meet the requirements for our nationwide presence with bicycles and trams alone. Honestly. I offer live video switching more often: this way I can answer CO2-free questions and also get a good mood. https://twitter.com/_ChrisMarkus/status/1137966717588688896‚Ä¶
I was actually in Russia and Japan at the weekend. Photo is 10 days old! :-)
Sunday was #DagDesGartens! From now on are #DageDesHarkens again! Solidary greetings to all garden fans! üòéüëç pic.twitter.com/Mqeqz7t3cJ
Wahnsinnn !!!! Congratulations to @uconradt on this great result! You will be a great OB for Saarbr√ºcken! https://twitter.com/uconradt/status/1137804852644503552‚Ä¶
"Done! G-20 trade ministers unanimously agreed on a joint final declaration! Open markets, free, fair, stable and non-discriminatory trade! Much remains to be done, but the EU cities have closed and acted successfully!"
"Thx so much dear @MalmstromEU for our good, trustful & successful cooperation in the interest of all our citizens! https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU/status/1137559447042060288¬†‚Ä¶"
"He was among the visitors to a panel where I gave a keynote. I greeted him in my speech, but we couldn&#39;t speak personally because I had to go to the next event"
"The Federal Government&#39;s stance is therefore clear. The fact that there have also been other opinions for a long time, across party borders, is not new, but a normal democratic case."
The Federal Government has repeatedly stated that the sanctions should remain in force as long as the reasons for their persistence persist. I repeated that again yesterday. Cooperation is possible in other areas and also takes place. https://twitter.com/ischinger/status/1137110582631510016‚Ä¶
"Dear Mr. R√∂pcke, I have just landed in St. Petersburg: I am not letting the gentlemen dictate which conference I may attend. I represent the interests of German companies here. The sanctions will continue to apply until the reasons for them are eliminated."
"Ever since DDayLandings our British friends have been present in overseas Europe: As military power, as allies, as friends! What a succes story! #NATO #EU #UK-German partnerships. Never change a winning team! #Brexit!? https://twitter.com/iancolintaylor/status/1136594185954516992¬†‚Ä¶"
"@AndreaNahlesSPD, has done &amp; achieved a lot for social cohesion. Thanks and recognition for that. Since the Bundestag election, coalition negotiations and personnel debates have unfortunately cost a lot of time and effort. That is why we now need material work and stability!"
"Honestly, the electricity must even go down. It is very high compared to other European countries."
"Since we are the only large industrialized country to shut down all nuclear power plants, it will take a little longer, but we are working consistently towards this."
"The CDU is best when we face real challenges and overcome opposites. The # coal exit is coming, the power supply remains secure &amp; affordable. Since 2013 5, CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants have been reduced by 34%. We continue on this path."
"7 years ago I published an article in the FAZ. Wouldn&#39;t repeat everything today, but the rough direction seems somehow still right: Politics and the Internet: Digital revolution: My new life among pirates https://www.faz.net/-gsi-6uc9z?GEPC=s33‚Ä¶ via @faznet"
"As long as necessary: we get out of nuclear power &amp; coal-based power generation, so we still need gas. As soon as green hydrogen from renewable energy is available in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices, pipelines and LNG terminals can be used to transport it."
"I suspect the other way around, a shoe will be made: the denial of climate change by the past forever made the Greens strong at all ... https://twitter.com/ulfposh/status/1133383844005056514 ..."
"I didn&#39;t always agree with @sebastiankurz. But the problems with AUT politics are older than its chancellorship. It is pro-European, with clear dividing lines to right wing and anti-Semitism. If you vote with FP√ñ to overthrow him, you&#39;re doing populist business! https://twitter.com/ronzheimer/status/1132725082168745985‚Ä¶"
"Peace &amp; Prosperity, Environment &amp; Security: Europe is the best thing that has happened to our peoples! If you want to strengthen &amp; protect Europe, you have to vote &amp; vote for a pro-European party. Best for the CDU üëç, but definitely not for the populists from right &amp; left!"
I have known Uwe Conrad personally for many years: he will be a great OB for Saarbr√ºcken! All good dear Uwe! https://twitter.com/uconradt/status/1131530956223983616‚Ä¶
I said that German law m. E. is compatible with the judgment. Because it assumes a record-keeping requirement that can be delegated
"Uff, a stone falls from my heart: otherwise I would have to save the SPD! ü§ì‚úåÔ∏è https://twitter.com/KuehniKev/status/1135828437631979520‚Ä¶"
Our persistent advocacy for tax cuts in favor of medium-sized businesses and family businesses has paid off: Olaf Scholz&#39;s announcement now needs to be fleshed out and implemented quickly.
I am pleased that more and more important and successful companies are choosing battery cell production! #VW #Northvolt #Opel #PSA #Saft. Good for jobs in Germany &amp; Europe!
"I am pleased about the very good congress on the national industrial strategy in Berlin today! Representatives of business and trade unions, entrepreneurs and startups. Everyone welcomed the initiative, many good suggestions and the will to find a good solution together!"
"Unfortunately, this is wrong. For parcel carriers that are paid according to the applicable law (this is the vast majority), the proposal changes zero point zero"
"Dear Ruprecht, In order to prevent this, Germany is committed to ensuring that a substantial gas transit through Ukraine is guaranteed even after 2020. The Ukraine, Russia and the EU Commission in Brussels are negotiating on our initiative."
"Notre-Dame de Paris: Faced with the immeasurable tragedy of the fire, we are all - in Germany, in Europe, all over the world - reunited with our French friends. Desperate and sad, dumb before this catastrophe."
"Yes, it was a very good and constructive session! I look forward to further cooperation!"
Another good proof that we need a strategy and a vision in Germany &amp; Europe. I am very happy that the debate is starting! https://twitter.com/ThomasSigmundHB/status/1117413901472292865‚Ä¶
Do you have any doubts? How could I ever threaten you? !! :-) https://twitter.com/ulfposh/status/1116393834060111873‚Ä¶
The ZDH&#39;s claim is more than justified. The tax incentive for energy-efficient building renovation is indispensable for climate protection and creates growth! https://twitter.com/ZDH_news/status/1115538709401800704‚Ä¶
"We are increasing the number of new apartments by 50%. By investing billions in social housing, child benefits and private housing."
"The only thing that #RobertHabeck will successfully #expropriate is the votes of the Greens! However, the big losers in the debate will be the tenants, because investors in residential construction are unfortunately scared."
"Sorry, but this is wrong. The sanctions apply and will be applied. The construction of automobile factories is clearly not one of them. We are not making a general boycott against Russia right now, but targeted sanctions."
It‚Äôs all about protection of fair competition but never about protection from competition! Sorry.
Milestone for the success of the energy transition: The Bundestag has just passed the law on expanding the power grids! Local citizens&#39; concerns were taken up. Thanks to all who helped.
"Sorry, but this is unfortunately wrong: I never look away when it comes to human rights. As Minister of Economy, I was first in the Ukraine and then only in Moscow, I am working intensively for Ukrainian interests, for example in gas transit! https://twitter.com/ronzheimer/status/1113414503570530304‚Ä¶"
"The cornerstones are a great opportunity: We will create new jobs in the lignite areas before old ones disappear. Industrial jobs with good pay, research institutions and authorities. With sufficient financial support. Together! https://twitter.com/MPKretschmer/status/1131164753940897792‚Ä¶"
"Unfortunately, it is even worse: there are tax increases, air bookings and an undisguised grip on the social security funds! https://twitter.com/OlafGersemann/status/1131141587810115585‚Ä¶"
We keep our promise: Tax research funding is coming! Federal cabinet today passed draft law: Good for SMEs &amp; innovation in Germany!
"Dear Sybrand, as the party leader and political leader of the CDA you have done extremely well. You have restored the unity of the CDA and reached Verl! Thank you very much for that! Good luck and success with your new job! Peter https://twitter.com/sybrandbuma/status/1130769173917962242‚Ä¶"
Great &amp; congratulations! Good luck!
"# J√ºrgenHabermas&#39; 90th birthday is over. There remains respect for a great man, to whom Germany has a lot to thank. People like him have given our country back to the world. # J√ºrgenHabermas is European through and through. We always needed that, today more than ever!"
This is a day after me and no reason to be arrogant at all! üòé
"If the reports on Case # L√ºbeck are true, it was cold-blooded right-wing extremist murder. We have not considered this possible since the NSU murders. It is terrible and cries out for unrestrained clarification and punishment. https://twitter.com/Herr_Decker/status/1140711228387602433‚Ä¶"
"I agree. But it is also a ray of hope: the solidarity of the Democrats in the OB election campaign in #Goerlitz was crucial. Gl√ºckzan #Ursu, Thanks to everyone who helped! https://twitter.com/FlorianGathmann/status/1140320249016987648‚Ä¶"
"We should not compare the pro-European, democratic parties CDU, CSU, SPD, FDP &amp; Greens with the AfD or similar populist parties. Not even with the Left Party. Because otherwise we make ourselves small and upgrade the parties on the edge."
The right wingers in the EP are an imposition for every European. Their march was stopped because the majority are fed up with their splitter slogans. Democracy &amp; humanity will win when we finally make our Europe strong &amp; capable of action! https://twitter.com/tazgezwitscher/status/1139209573422817280‚Ä¶
For those who migrate it is completely ok. Respect! But the country lives from the fact that regions are not left behind and the older ones are left behind. Therefore money for structural change. Some would like to stay if they could make their money in their old home.
Really now ? üòé
"#AnneFrank could still be alive today, could have children, grandchildren &amp; great-grandchildren. But she was betrayed by the murder and extermination of the Jews of youth, life and age, of friends and suffering. Your lasting legacy: never again! and: Resist the Beginnings!"
"Yes, something like that! Birds, squirrels, crawl, earthworms, caterpillars, butterflies, aphids - full of biodiversity! :-)"
