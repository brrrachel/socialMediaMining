. @ ManfredWeber: This European election is about defending our Europe. The radicals stand for a Europe of selfishness. That will split and tear Europe apart. We stand against it and are for a Europe of togetherness. # CSUPT19
". @ ManfredWeber: If Donald Trump and the Greens want to build walls in trade policy, then I say we will continue to build bridges and rely on cooperation. # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: We need the principle of reciprocity with China. This applies, for example, to public tenders. We must also be able to prevent takeovers if Chinese companies are only interested in buying out the fillets. # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: I want a European Internet, shaped by our values and principles. If you want to make a lot of money in Europe, like internet giants, you have to accept our rules. # CSUPT19"
. @ ManfredWeber: What is not possible is that the law is voted in Brussels and then in Berlin the mood is raised. We cannot allow this duplicity to pass. #Copyright # CSUPT19
". @ ManfredWeber: We have to ensure that investigative authorities across Europe can access criminal data. Not just voluntarily, but mandatory. I want a safe Europe. # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: I want a Europe that acts faster and responds to problems. #Frontex must be built up to 10,000 border guards at least twice as quickly as planned. # CSUPT19"
. @ ManfredWeber: It is our job to enforce the EU&#39;s external border protection. We need to know who is in the EU. That&#39;s what people expect from us. # CSUPT19
". @ ManfredWeber: I say: As long as Tsipras and Salvini have bad labor market policies, their neighbors cannot be responsible for the effects. Yes to a strong Europe, no to the EU unemployment insurance of the SPD. # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: People tell me: take care of the bureaucracy. That is why Europe needs a kind of standards control council. Europe has to regulate for the corporations, but not always for the small and medium-sized companies. # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: Bavaria is a role model for many other regions in Europe. That we are economically strong, that we combine tradition and modernity. Our Europe is a Europe that has its regions at heart. # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: The uncertainty in Great Britain has the potential to infect the entire EU. That mustn&#39;t happen. If a country wants to leave the EU, it cannot have a say in shaping the future of the EU. #Brexit # CSUPT19"
". @ ManfredWeber: A cool head is necessary for the #Brexit. But let&#39;s be clear about one thing: finally come to the result. Give us orientation where you want to go. The EU is not leaving the UK, but the other way around. # CSUPT19"

. @ Markus_Soeder: Our concept for the protection of species must be to develop a large painting from a small picture. The main idea: not at the expense of a group! Discussion is pissing off farmers.

. @ MarkusBlume: We use digital progress: We want to make membership more attractive and make digital offers. # csupt19
. @ MarkusBlume: Only if we strive to become younger and more feminine will we be able to remain deeply rooted as a People&#39;s Party. A central element is the tapering of the base. # csupt19
. @ MarkusBlume: We know about the responsibility that we have to renew ourselves. Renewal has always been part of the CSU. We want to spark new enthusiasm. # csupt19
. @ MarkusBlume: We are firmly convinced that this country and these times need strong people&#39;s parties. We are the advocate of all citizens and not just the high-earners. A strong lawyer is needed in these times of uncertainty. # csupt19
. @ MarkusBlume: We do not give up the concept of the People&#39;s Party. We believe in the People&#39;s Party. We want to start the way back to old strength! # csupt19

. @ Markus_Soeder: Our base is the treasure of the party. The basis of the CSU is the best and most valuable we have. # csupt19
". @ Markus_Soeder: We need more say. We have to get younger and more feminine, but we shouldn&#39;t forget our regulars. We have to reinvent &quot;Mia san mia&quot;. # csupt19"
. @ Markus_Soeder: Environmental protection is home protection. To be conservative means to preserve the legacy of the environment for our children. # csupt19
". @ Markus_Soeder: We are the party that wants to preserve Bavaria&#39;s unique heritage: tradition, customs, volunteering, nature, landscape and environment. Preserving what you appreciate is conservative politics. # csupt19"
. @ Markus_Soeder: We are a party of security. Bavaria is the safest federal state in Germany. We react prudently and consistently. Together we will find the right balance between humanity and order. # csupt19
". @ Markus_Soeder: The CSU is the party of social responsibility. The S in the name is no accident. It does not mean redistribution, but the respect for human dignity. # csupt19"
". @ Markus_Soeder: The CSU is Christian. Our foundation is a Christian image of man. We don&#39;t want to teach anyone. The CSU was never a party of ideology, but a party of freedom and hope. # csupt19"
". @ Markus_Soeder: Just being conservative is not enough, the CSU is always social and liberal. All these roots should be found in party work in an equal way. # csupt19"
. @ Markus_Soeder: The CSU must be a protective force for the citizens. We are modernizers and keepers in one. # csupt19
". @ Markus_Soeder: Views in the country have also changed. We should take it more seriously. The world is getting smaller, worries are getting closer. We have to give new orientation to the big questions of the time. # csupt19"
. @ Markus_Soeder: The Bavarian voters have given us an order. Governance alone is not enough. We have to provide orientation in the long term. # csupt19
. @ Markus_Soeder: The European election is about a lot. The European idea is at greatest risk from within. Nationalists and populists want to split some #Europe. # csupt19
. @ Markus_Soeder: We represent Bavaria and are convinced federalists. Competition is better than leveling. Diversity as simplicity. Federalism better than centralism. # csupt19
". @ Markus_Soeder: Increasing the well-being of the country, the people and the CSU is my promise. I want to work with heart and mind for this country and get involved. # csupt19"
. @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria is more successful and wealthy than ever. This is no coincidence: This is also due to the continuously correct policy and the course that has been set for decades. # csupt19
. @ Markus_Soeder: The #CSU is inseparable from Bavaria. The CSU is Bavaria and Bavaria is the CSU. That must remain our motto. # csupt19
. @ Markus_Soeder: We are not a normal x-arbitrary party. We are #family and #home for many people. The CSU must always remain the decisive party in #Bavaria. We work for it! # csupt19
