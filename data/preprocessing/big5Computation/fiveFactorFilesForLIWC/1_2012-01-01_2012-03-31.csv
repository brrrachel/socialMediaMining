@ b0ns4i Springer&#39;s interests are balanced by millions of buyers + as far as I know he has more followers on Twitter than many others
". @ aotto1968_2 @alvar_f @kretsc Yes, exactly, &quot;on time&quot; is the key word."
@alvar_f @ b0ns4i @kretsc I tried to explain that by quoting from the decision. But a decision is not yet a law
@frontmotor U I have no difficulty with the term &quot;community&quot;: You are welcome to assign me to the &quot;politician community&quot; or any other.
"@Konrad Yes, but you should never stop thinking. Because reality changes again and again."
"@Aproonline @ b0ns4i @alvar_f @kretsc So far there is no evidence for this, at least not in the decision of the coalition committee."
"@ b0ns4i @alvar_f @kretsc Not earning money but balancing interests. We do that all the time, with (almost) every law"
@_einstein_ It is constantly changing and many are learning. But this often requires moving in both areas: network and non-network
@ PCShadow42 Since I don&#39;t make the law (is BMJ) I sometimes have to be vague. Otherwise it is said that I had led behind the spruce.
"@ b0ns4i @alvar_f @kretsc However, (almost) everyone wants money: publishers, google, youtube ... politics has to ensure the right balance"
@_einstein_ I am convinced that locks are wrong because network access is almost as important to me as staple foods

@tmmd It looks like it&#39;s not just &quot;a few publishers&quot;. A shit storm alone doesn&#39;t make politics. :-)
@ostpirat Agree: Anyone who thinks that he can head through the wall usually has a headache afterwards.
@ b0ns4i I&#39;ve known the dialogue since I&#39;ve been on Twitter. The network only has to recognize that not all decision-makers are active on social media.
I am convinced that a solution is possible that publishers AND network communities can live with.
"Idea #LSR is not mine, but I don&#39;t get into the bushes. I want real dialogue as soon as #SLS presents its draft. f3"
"Summary of today&#39;s #LSR debate: 1. The network is alive, 2. It has a clear opinion, 3. The motto: &quot;Only firm druff&quot;. Reflexes work! f2"
I would basically take half of what @Schmidtlepp takes. I really think he&#39;s a professional
"Oskar Lafontaine has taken something for interviews for years. After comeback with Linke, he had to get used to laboriously @Schmidtlepp"
"Just for information: As far as I know, the mere link remains remuneration-free."
"As soon as the draft law is available, there will be lively debate with proposals for clarification and improvement. Contributions expressly requested."
Open questions have to be answered. But it is not out of the question if press publishers are involved in profits from commercial Internet services
@xsteadfastx The network belongs to us alen: you as well as me. :-)
I cannot answer many individual questions about #LSR yet because GE is not yet available. Yesterday agreement on principles as described.
"With #LSR private users are not affected. In the commercial Economy remain reading on screen, saving and printing free of charge."
#LSR coalition decision does not affect private users. No obligation to pay for private use of press products online!
@olpen yes who else! Warm regards to the young liberals!
@ MichaelHahn5 I read that yesterday. But the offer for tapping came from the Bundeswehr.

"As you can see, not only do pirates get coffee, but also Twitter pioneers like @danielmack from the WK of @petertauber :-)"
@RGoerner already happened! Bon weekend!
@WimvandeCamp Thank you very much! Together we are strong in Europe!
@edomblog Don&#39;t throw the shotgun so quickly!
@JohannesEngel Thank you. Hope the S&#39;U is doing well in the election campaign. We&#39;ll do that!
@bavarianrebel Fully with you in memory of great cooperation in the Schäuble-Sinner-AG!
@jpvanmourik Sleep well!
"@MatthijsvBonzel Dear Matthijs, I hope you are still doing well and I keep very nice memories of our conversations"
@jpvanmourik Of course I will never forget my Dutch friends! I think it&#39;s a shame that I don&#39;t receive tweets that often!
@DennyRamone Here!
"@tpcom Greece has a choice between internal + external devaluation. It's up to them to decide. Personaly, would prefere keeping EUro intact"
"@ToastHerz Funky, that&#39;s my constituency! Many greetings back!"
Now get me off the field. Greetings especially to all friends in Saarland who are still awake and alert!
@SteinbachErika :-))
@DennyRamone @stefanleifert Everyone can come! My respect for Gauck is honest and great
@florianeder @marianschreier Lets hope so!
"@SteinbachErika @petertauber Fear, in the end everyone adds their mustard. But agreed: Twitter evening with me with beaver meatballs + mustard"
@StefanLeifert At that time he did not appear with us. Maybe that was a mistake
"@marianschreier No longer growth can be generated by deficit-sprending. Greeced neds foreign investment, de-regulation and new ideas"
@petertauber meatballs are always good!
@smalldogsarmy The wine is truth? But I think Greece is restored.
@ T4all he will be chosen safely. There is no howl of triumph. But hope for a good term
"@haraldlink We had our own candidate. Nobody knew how that ended. Incidentally, Wulff was not a bad president"
"@florianeder After all, we managed to stabilize the Euro-zone. No longer useless talks about Eurobonds and/or ECB as lender of last resort."
"@SteinbachErika Of course you have always been smarter because you knew him, he impressed us others!"
No further @smalldogsarmy be bound!
@koehntopp Definitely. The financial markets are unfortunately politically blind. Hence the extreme rashes
"@yaguza Yes, because of the UK followers"
@SandyKoch It's all a matter of confidence and democratic leadership!
@ 2n1f Great that you see it that way. Help us to enrich it online too!
"@ PsychoTR0N I was afraid, but unfortunately I can&#39;t help you there :-). By the way, he doesn&#39;t know that much about pirates and the net"
@grafsoundso It all depends on the economic development and willingness to reform in Greece: So really no automatism
"@smalldogsarmy Only every now and then, because of the UK followers, who are very close to my heart. Should also tweet more in FR and NL"
"@KLausi_Berlin Certainly not. D is in good shape: economic, social, political!"
"@ Schma1975 At that time, red / green were shouting, which allowed them to force us on their candidate!"
"@waschbaerpower Good things take time. In 2010, red / green messed it up by rushing ahead. :-("
@ T4all I agree. But it also applies: give him a chance!
@koehntopp Small causes can provoke big events. Greece has become a symbole of EU willingness to overcome and avoid crisis
@Youth Association No advice from the Left Party!
@ chrisjaeger83 personable and smart. Gauck can reconcile and integrate - and still be an independent mind.
@stesatz Already Konrad Adenauer said: nobody can prevent us from becoming smarter!
The Greek bailout is a matter of wisdom and solidarity. It enables us to implement  reforms and will avoid world-wide recession.
Joachim Gauck can be a great asset for Germany. This is becoming more and more apparent. &#39;Today&#39;s impressive performance at CDU / CSU
@LukasGriesbaum Nice that you sinxd on Twitter! And good luck politically and privately!
@ chrisjaeger83 :-))
@oprubikon Good things just take a while. And democracy means that you can change your mind if the arguments are right.
They came to me seconds before! @ chrisjaeger83 About Gauck red / green may be annoyed with black. It&#39;s really good!
"Gauck is a win for all of us, and I prefer Greece without a chancellor majority 10 times more than Eurobonds with the SPD! :-) @ThomasOppermann"
@ben__schaefer I don&#39;t think so: the lead of red / green was mostly smaller at the time and they ruled ...
@michael_hgw But the prerequisite for design and assertiveness! :-)) Of course we are competent anyway!
@urmelmann :-)
"@skglas congratulations on good memory! We still had 19 votes more than complete opposition, with no pressure or threat."
"@KonstantinNotz If &#39;decay&#39; continues at this pace, we have to get warm in 20y! 19 st advantage is more than red / green usually had"
Coalition had 19 votes more than SPD / Greens / Leftists together in Greece vote. This shows that we are able to act at any time.
@FWhamburg @ReporterZDF Not at all: We had 19 votes more than SPD / Greens / Leftists together
@kritikkultur @DWoehrl @hildwin @Schmidtlepp @Twecht @GottfriedMdA @DoroBaer What is going on in Pankow-Nord?
@U_Batke Linke can vote for Gauck or propose his own candidate - but no right to participate in the coalition of the willing
@Weitk For me there is no reason to change anything in my then reply - either the invitation is withdrawn
"@csinss That&#39;s right, but the left is being watched by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution in federal and state states, for example regarding positions on property."
@BabatundeOgboru Because we had a candidate in Christian Wulff that we were very convinced of at the time.
"@csinss With SPD, Greens, FDP, CDU / CSU the answer is crystal clear. It is crucial. Left must remove ambivalence in terms of democracy"
"@ JohnDoe9277 How is it that the CDUZ was able to change its opinion on Gauck, but the left did not? #Grundkonsens"
@Sindimindi The decision is not made by me. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s legally problematic.
@linksgruen @stoffi_cf As you like it. But then please don&#39;t complain: :-)
@LOB_ComBridge Our basic principle is that of representative democracy. There are good and bad choices in both systems: #Waldheim
"@anbusch In 2010, SPD and Greens first talked to Mr. Gauck and appointed him internally as candidate and only than offered him to us."
"That&#39;s how it is, @herr_thiesmeyer, if everyone else agreed, Linke was (almost) always against it. That is their right, but nothing more"
Thanks to @ longrunner1 and many others for numerous suggestions. Discussing them publicly would destroy them: - ((.
@JanDoerrenhaus You don&#39;t have to tweet to anyone. The former president of the BVerfG is known to everyone.
@nonsansretour The elaboration of science. Service does not exclude the honorary salary for Christian Wulff. Arnim&#39;s conclusions are one-sided
"@thexmoe Good idea, but it is essential for the security conference!"
@guentergloser I don&#39;t remember that any SPD politician would have asked Wulff to resign. # WürdedesAmtes
@naaarf :-)
@padmodi Arnim is not a good argument - unfortunately it is often wrong. Too bad.
@El_Pumper I admire your knowledge of human nature!
"Of course, Linke must not have a say in the talks with the SPD / Greens, since she always refuses to agree (Europe, Bundeswehr) @stoffi_cf"
@BenPBradshaw And by the way: Angela Merkel is not in trouble (as is clearly indicated by thed polls). :-))
@BenPBradshaw 2010 the way the SPD man was presented made it impossible to accept him. TheWulff-allegations could'nt be imagend in 2010
@gelsen :-))
At this time on Saturday morning @gelsen should be asleep! :-)
@christiansoeder I think they were smart: otherwise they would have had red-red debate on the heel
@ThomasOppermann @Schmidtlepp Oh yes? I was always on the air and the number of followers developed splendidly ...
"@Dukes_Secretary Don&#39;t worry. If everyone works constructively, what usually comes out is decent."
@zonkinoff You overlook the fact that CDU General Secretary Geißler u Minister Blüm were active opponents of apartheid at the time.
@Tobias_Schulze Votes in BT on Europe and foreign assignments are clear. I enabled the only consensus proposal (NSU murders)
"@boro_berlin At the moment we are trying to find a candidate who is eligible for Greens, SPD, FDP and CDU / CSU. Who is open?"
"@mjhussmann The other way around: If everyone else has agreed on a consensus, Linke was mostly on the sidelines."
@Elfengleich He has declared that he has not committed any wrongdoing. He justified his resignation with a loss of trust among the population
. @ Schmidtlepp Who will the pirates actually send to the Federal Assembly?
@masalm All who are now talking about joint candidates were democratically elected in the Bundestag or Landtag.
". @ edomblog There is something there, but the GG is pretty clear: all state authority comes from the people."
"@ PsychoTR0N That is the goal. But only works if you don&#39;t chat too much, otherwise nobody will jump over his shadow in the end."
". @ tmmd Unfortunately we cannot discuss the names in public, otherwise they will all be burned!"
. @ christiansoeder What is wrong with you? Your SPD leaders have responded positively and obviously see it that way too :-))
@SchaengelPirat :-))
. @ Keptn_Zaziki Now it&#39;s about the Federal President. The coalition in Berlin works.
". @ schmidrudi It&#39;s always like that. Since the Federal President is elected by the Federal Assembly, we have to talk to the political groups there."
". @ Doener If we really want joint candidates, we should not talk to the SPD and Greens via Twitter but directly! :-)"
"@NicDiek In the GG, the citizen is the sovereign: It was therefore right to first greet the new followers and only then to talk about politics."
"Despite everything, the day can turn into something good: a joint candidate would be a strong signal that the basic democratic consensus is intact!"
"I welcome @MaghMichael as my 8,000th follower. Now you also have to tweet properly!"
. @ Agapornid Bismarck has given us the universal right to vote. Later he was angry because the Reichstag wanted to get rid of him :-)
"@KonstantinNotz @sven_giegold Bien sur! See already Black-Green Pizza Connection with Cem Özdemir, @Volker_Beck, Steffi Lemke and many more :-)"
Thanks to all the students who were at Stuckrad-Barre: You were great! I was very happy to invite you to a drink. Details tomorrow
"Here Stuckrad-Barre: people, please come immediately to Straalauer Allee7, Berlin Friedrichshain. Altmaier and I spend one!"
@ jolicoeur11 But they don&#39;t reach anyone - except those who are already convinced anyway. :-)
@edomblog It is always the case that international agreements are negotiated by governments. But the parliaments have to agree
Today Heveling / Krings have declared that they reject legal network blocks. I agree with 100 per cent! @raketenmensch
"@ Raketenmensch Oh, I thought we agreed: Kulturkampf is always stupid, whether from the left or the right. :-)"
@petertauber Nobody showed me the photos again. But the @tokoo should be very good as a photographer ...
"@dictvm there are more things between heaven and earth that are difficult to understand, but nevertheless have their justification! :-)"
"@fxdx Better to lower expectations, then you won&#39;t be disappointed afterwards! :-)"
@woksoll @KonstantinNotz Don&#39;t worry: Positions on important political questions must be democratically clarified in all parties!
@HoffmannPhilip The JU Merzig-Wadern did a great job - one of the best Saarland events this year!
"@Opp_Sprecher @sebibrux The Union faction is &#39;storm-proof and overgrown&#39;, not only in Lower Saxony! :-)"
"@huettemann @euHvR Thanks for the greetings, Europe always wins!"
@fxdx Freedom of expression always applies! But I also have positions on network policy :-)
Looking forward to New Year&#39;s reception at @petertauber with many exciting guests &amp; topics! Will not be easy ... :-)
@kinzmill we too
"I hereby cordially invite you to @kinzmill! As a guest speaker, I do that :-))"
@KonstantinNotz ambivalence sometimes does no harm. The ability to relativize is one of the greatest achievements of mankind!
@KonstantinNotz Cet animal est tres mechant: quand l &#39;on attaque il se defend! Bismarck would no longer do the cultural struggle today.
@ No1de @noz_de Yes: Experimental laboratory is a great compliment. Pirates try new ways because they are not yet constrained
@ No1de I was criticized for praising the pirates too much - in articles and interviews. Where the hell is the problem?
I will not respond to inquiries from @tauss until he apologizes to @herrurbach for the &quot;laboratory rat&quot;.
"@udogeh Gorgeous, very gorgeous! How will it be in the third youth! :-)"
"Thanks, I tried to be factual. @_Social_Angels"
"@Stecki When the euro opponents should not speak in the &quot;plenum&quot;, there was a storm of indignation."
We don&#39;t recall anyone because they have their own opinion: #Free mandate! Follows 2 @Stecki
"The pirates, for example, reject any factional pressure - and should we pull someone out of #eidg because they have their own opinion? @Doner"
@Tob_Sch @ victor5679 Sometimes factual theses are ignored. A.Heveling has achieved that there is discussion
@ victor5679 It&#39;s great when @DoroBaer @DWoehrl take part in the debate. I am a PGF and have to hold all the MPs together
I have spoken in detail in a FAZ article u in at least 8 interviews about network policy + will continue to do so @henrikMSL
"@ victor5679 Ansgar Heveling is also &#39;civilized&#39;, maybe he wanted to make sure that he wasn&#39;t overlooked - he did it!"
"With S.Kauder and G.Krings I had said that it is not a faction line, A.Heveling avoided any misunderstanding @ victor5679"
"I don&#39;t constantly distance myself from colleagues, not even if they are Greens or Social Democrats. @ victor5679"
". @ victor5679 My opinion on these questions is known, but Ansgar #Heveling is also entitled to his opinion."
"I am not letting anyone down, but the network community, for whom freedom of expression is so important, also has to endure debates. @ victor5679"
"How about serenity ?: Freedom of expression for everyone, whether you like it or not! (Almost) every debate on the net is better than none!"
"GsD, it&#39;s been a relaxing day for a long time. The children throw themselves in molds and have a lot of fun. Everything&#39;s o.k!"
@news_de Thank you very much for your good idea. It was fun!
"@news_de The GG is the best constitution we&#39;ve ever had! That is why we protect the GG against right-wing extremists, for example: #defensive democracy"
@news_de Strong shoulders carry more. But we can only solve the euro crisis if we tackle the causes through reforms and less debt.
"@news_de That&#39;s what security experts believe. Therefore #VDS was decided by the EU, CDU / CSU / SPD are in favor of it. Almost everyone on the net is against it"
@news_de Tweets about personal or intimate are taboo for me: Twitter is part of the public space &amp; therefore similar limits apply
@news_de I was on the Anne Wil Talk Show about &quot;Pirates&quot; &amp; was surprised at how intensely it was discussed on Twitter
@ Kyra2001 :-)) !!!
"@ Kyra2001 the new forms expand the possibility of democratic participation enormously. When it comes to content, pirates are often just beginning"
@Volker_Beck Are you as a green about an imperative mandate? #lgbt #Lesbians #gays
"If the CDU and pirates were the same in everything, one of the two would be superfluous. # democratic competition @ Kyra2001"
"@ Kyra2001 I also take the party seriously, with members I differentiate by person. Hopefully we&#39;ll see what is good!"
@Volker_Beck You know my opinion. But every MEP still decides what to sign. #Answer
"@ Kyra2001 So far everyone says I praised the pirates! :-) Passage to coalitions was not disrespectful, just a statement"
"I like rats too, but whoever calls a person a &quot;laboratory rat&quot; disqualifies himself and should apologize @tauss @ Kyra2001"
"@ No1de No, but they have a lot of new ideas and you will see which ones prevail and which fail"
&#39;I very much appreciate&#39; colleague Krings is Vice-Chairman of the parliamentary group. and can deliver PM&#39;s in this capacity at any time
@Tauss&#39;s omissions on @HerrUrbach and anyone who disagrees with them are the bottom drawer: sad! : - ((
@JU_Neuwied I&#39;m also happy to come 20 minutes later because of a problem with a rental car
"@MaysensX You can&#39;t really separate that. Political parties are part of it, you just can&#39;t make them absolute. The network puts a lot into perspective."
"@ Kyra2001 That will structure itself in the future, in forms and with instruments that nobody knows today."
"@ Kyra2001 True, but pirates are changing rapidly: no one knows in which direction, but the experiment is the key."
"@ Kyra2001 2: I find the written word more forgiving than the hard speech. Nevertheless, the DE is awesome and until 1.3. it&#39;s still there"
@StefanLeifert Do you have any doubts? :-)
"@ Kyra2001 @Afelia The goodwill is there, but I still don&#39;t have a headset because the idea scares me. Follows 2"
@ Kyra2001 Imagine what happens when hundreds of thousands discuss in this way in 5 or 10 years. Nobody can do that.
"@ Kyra2001 He does not give power, he takes it because everyone can participate, even if he is alone in the province!"
@ Kyra2001 You don&#39;t really mean that! That thing has already changed the world today! And brought the CDU-PGF to new ideas!
"@ Kyra2001 On the contrary. Praise the #DE wherever I go, most recently in a mirror conversation with @Afelia :-)"
@NickLeifert something with cult.
"@CDUBiblis Yes, it is. But afterwards you can no longer see that in the results. Not the other way around. :-("
@SteinbachErika @Lanzenheim @bueti @volker_beck We are already storming the charts - and there is not even an election campaign # 36% :-)
"@Volker_Beck Habs tried so many times, but unfortunately I always fell asleep :-)"
@Duesenberg_ And how! Hope you missed me at least something? :-))
"@Volker_Beck I asked if you ever criticized something at your party? If not, you should be infallible! :-)"
@sofakissen The @UlrichKelber just wants to play! But the SPD has to do its homework first!
. @ valentinholzer These are all my friends! Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t follow me! :-)
"@larsreineke If it was necessary, I have never had problems with distance: #reading glasses. You should discuss the matter with G.Krings"
@Volker_Beck That says the right person: You have never taken anything on the green with the Greens! Only with others! :-))
@derdino @JoernPL That&#39;s right! But the elections in Berlin recently weren&#39;t that great for the Greens either!
". @ JoernPL I&#39;m sorry, but Greens have lost 40 percent of their voters since March u Red / Green is only 3 percent ahead of black / yellow! :-)"
"@beapirate This applies to all parties, except for Die Linke!"
@christiansoeder That&#39;s how I am! :-))
@ thobi75 :-)
The @NadineSchoen nobody buys the cutting: Of course it was there before me!
@ jolicoeur11 that&#39;s ok. But Twitter can do more than party politics and we should look for common ground on important network topics.
"@JonasScheunig I agree. If the principles are clear, everything else will follow itself. #Acta"
"The @jensbest tweet makes me very sad: it is wrong, outrageous and stupid. We shouldn&#39;t do party politics online."
"Thanks for the many @replies on my #ACTA statement. Is meant honestly and will be redeemed. Tomorrow more, I&#39;m now in #Paris: Bonsoir"
"Oh, the famous @tj_tweets is on Twitter HQ! It should increase the max Z to 180! :-) yourself: #german #celebrity"
I only answer questions from @tauss when he apologizes to @herrurbach for the rat comparison. Must block him.
@yrthy because intellectual property is as important as other property. Theft is also combated
"@Oreo_Pirat ok, I&#39;ll take the subjunctive back! :-)"
"Net locks should not be inserted through the front or back door, not even through the revolving door!"
"Product piracy must be combated nationally and internationally, but blocking or monitoring networks would be completely wrong means."

"@ aotto1968_2 Good suggestion, but I don&#39;t know if I have my followers or who I have! :-)"
@sven_kindler the two seats for the center were a tribute to Windthorst and will fall away again next time

"@Afelia&#39;s decision deserves great respect! Because it is clever and honest, it will not weaken the @Pirate Party."
"Since I have been on Twitter, we have learned that PMs from MdBs only bind the parliamentary group if there are decisions to do so. @frederics"

@daniel_ueberall The discussion on Twitter was pleasantly balanced and unexcited! Feel really treated properly! :-)
"Dear @SteinbachErika, the @cdu_saar is currently in a good mood as the CDU Hessen in the mid-70s!"
@Tokoo is really a great photographer: he can even take good photos of me!
"@edomblog But: since wulff had fewer votes in the first round than the cdu / csu / fdp, at least as many did not vote for him."
@annmeiritz In the matter it was right that questions / answers came on the net. Casual wording didn&#39;t have to be that way. :-)
@DanielRJStecher Please read again: I said that the pirates can currently not coalition with any party.
@edomblog All CDU / CSU delegates had decided that. There were also enough who did not follow the 1st and 2nd ballots
Thanks for the flowers: You can also have an interesting discussion about the digital world in classic print media. @frankfeil
FTT has been demanded by the CDU for over a year and we have a party conference decision that it has to start with the Eurozone if necessary. @spitzelHeinz
@kluelz This is the power of men and works according to the principle of evolution. Just like Twitter retweets.
"Dear @ Government4tel, count the number of my tweets in 2012, growth in followers and press reports: &quot;Immerse&quot; is different! :-))"

@DreisamDavid :-)
@sven_kindler We should do it as the EU Commission suggests. Then moving to London or Zurich will not help either
@awillburger The markets are like road traffic: rules are needed so that freedom can develop.
"@principiante_ww The goal is stable, broad-based government. I am sure that Annegret KK has a clear mandate for this."
@DreisamDavid So far we have always managed all important points together with the FDP. Wait and see!
The CDU is for the FTT and decided at its party conference that it should only be introduced in the Eurozone if necessary. @Volker_Beck
@PLANETSAFER More than enough. And sometimes the driver&#39;s license is gone for a while
@Oxfam_DE Always on the subject!

"@CDUBiblis is right: We need a lot of measures, but we should start with the FTT because there is the most support for it."
"@sebweigle Don&#39;t worry, we can do it."
"@awillburger That is not what FTT is about, but the signal to the financial markets that we are preventing undesirable developments."
@ FlyHippie1971 let&#39;s do it. There are also many in the FDP who want that.
. @ StefanLeifert I am - as is usually the case - based on reason! I am convinced that the FDP base also wants the FTT.
. @ oliverdorausch It&#39;s not about income. It is about countering perversions of the financial markets. It is overdue.
. @ Meranier That&#39;s right. What is much worse is that they are unable to learn from it.
". @ awillburger There is also something of 19 billion tax cuts: If the CDU, CSU, FDP agree, that&#39;s no problem. I rely on reason."
@oprubikon @schroeder_k You have to specify: Where have I ever posted advertising tweets?
@APHClarkson The latter is a short term problem because there is a dynamic process within FDP ...
@olafcramme Shall see. In all this MS public opinion is in favour by large. It's a dynamic process. #EU #FTT
@sgerst I am not concerned with income but with the fact that nobody is laughed at who invests their money for 2 or 3 per cent: HFT
".@APHClarkson If the UK wants to protect the City,  we should respect this. The UK will certainely accept FTT in our countries in exchange"

@trendworx You&#39;re right: that&#39;s why I think the idea of an independent foundation is good.
"@es_be_er If there are multiple agencies, pluralism is greater. Results don&#39;t get more pleasant, they get better"
"@josh_k_phisher Yes, I know, but the Hanover public prosecutor&#39;s office has stated that the report is not a reason for investigative proceedings"
Debate about independent European rating agency is getting going. We are putting pressure in Brussels: it is not a good thing if 3 agencies have oligipol.
@ Government4tel :-)
". @ ThomasMuellers On the contrary, if we start with 20 or more EU countries, many will follow worldwide."
"@mrdaiber &#39;Yes, indeed! :-)"
. @ Phosphate stick I am convinced that there are still exciting debates in the FDP.
"@_Belze_ yes, he&#39;s still alive, he&#39;s still alive, he&#39;s fine! More in the theater soon! :-))"
"@lonelyjogger Sorry, you have to click on my tweets, because I do not send everyone to everyone because I do not want to clutter the followers."
@Borael But that is not decided by the government. We have democracy after all!
"@Volker_Beck I wrote to you about this yesterday, but you obviously don&#39;t read your mentions either! :-)"
@lonelyjogger @Volker_Beck Of course you have to count my @replies: Then there are 23! :-)
@Borael There is nothing to do for the government: No crimes / violations of the law have been identified to date. Prosecutor declined to investigate
". @ wolfgang_thies Ooch, I was at causa Wulff with Anne Will, Günter Jauch, in the DLF and in the Moma. The BP also speaks for itself :-)"
. @ Volker_Beck totally lost track of his TL: I posted 23 tweets yesterday + he didn&#39;t notice anything as a follower! :-)
"@FrederikFatz Best wishes back, we are still sitting with Michael and Max and solve the problems of this world! :-)"
"@ migrate89 @pettre Yes, we should all be careful not to play the same games all the time. But this applies to both sides! :-)"
"@ World famous It doesn&#39;t always work, but you should try it! #Sustainability"
"@pettre the BP should not be prejudged. That was right. Now debate continues: this is democracy! At Rau, the SPD was squeamish"
@pettre Read my many statements before Christmas: I always said that everything has to be clarified + (follows 2)
"@plpppr @gelsen Oh yes, this has changed the content of positions: I think completely differently today about network blocks and fundamentally reject them."
"@plpppr @gelsen That&#39;s exactly how it was: Twitter holidays are like school holidays! Great at the beginning, and then you&#39;re happy when they&#39;re over!"
@SvenVolmering I wish JU-NRW a successful 2012! And that the red / green state government will be replaced by the CDU!
. @ pettre Respect for the BVerfG requires that you wait and follow your decisions. Opp suggestions were also problematic
@frederics :-)) All the best!
@BrunoGertKramm We have been working on it for 1 year and have convinced most EU countries. It&#39;s not that bad. Now nails with heads
"@Eifelralf The CDU has been in favor of this for over a year, Angela Merkel has personally made this her concern."
"@vertigonix You don&#39;t have to ban it, it&#39;s enough if it becomes unattractive."
. @ Phidorian There is a constructive debate in the FDP about this. We will find a common position and achieve the introduction.
"@Alex_Mitrakas Together with the FDP, we will achieve results that enable us to play a European leadership role."
. @ red_hardliner Wulff is entitled to an objective debate. But the allegations need to be resolved. Fighting for it is fun. :-)
We urgently need the financial transaction tax and must not allow 1 or 2 EU countries to block it!
"@plpppr page 34, last page economic section! :-)"
"@alrightokee Today I was at 8.10 am in detail on Deutschlandfunk! As I judge you, you are an early riser and heard that!"
"@Weitk The best thing is: I don&#39;t only cook and twitter, I also eat for her! Best New Year&#39;s wishes for all my Dutch followers!"
"@Volker_Beck No, of course not: Saarland is unique!"
"@cgnw mobil the blackberry, otherwise mostly my PC. Ipad very rarely."
@spd_stefan It was correct that the BP spoke personally this week. From tomorrow (DLF 8.10) you can experience me again!
@Weitk I am very convinced that the German Federal President will hold D May as the lecture! :-)
@oliverdasgupta The two parties have to decide for themselves. You may find a way to resolve the differences.
@alrightokee Neither nor. I made several comments before Christmas. The BP had the floor this week.
. @ _ Belze First I invited @sekor_ weeks ago to coffee and cake in Berlin when he came by. I&#39;m curious!
@principiante_ww I hope with a strong government led by @_A_K_K_! It&#39;s about Saarland and its future!
@_A_K_K_ shows responsibility and leadership in difficult times. A good decision for the Saarland and only for there.
. @ aotto1968_2 Welcome to everyone! I am glad that I am well rested! On new deeds!
"@ World-famous Yes, but then you need new clothes, new photos, etc. Always think about the consequences! In politics too!"
"@vpursuit Yes, thanks for asking! 10 days abstinence from politics and Twitter give a whole new feeling of freedom! All the best!"
@cgnw I spoke intensively about this before Christmas. It was clear that the debate would continue after Christmas: this is democracy.
. @ JohannesPonader @W_SK @katjakipping Have a good 2012! Maybe we will advance the financial transaction tax!
@pettre But that&#39;s a statement! And what is it based on?
"@ingoj Exceptionally, we don&#39;t have a VDS debate today! :-) Incidentally, that would not have been permitted under the old law."
@edomblog You can also read a lot about my donation affair at that time. I was already MdB and have vehemently pushed for clarification.
@ simpsons3 It does more than 140 lines! :-) Coming soon a detailed description on my new homepage.
@Volker_Beck We will get together soon and then we will discuss how we react to the unbearable work of the NPD.
@Operfriend &quot;abdicate&quot; is only available to monarchs - and they are extremely reluctant and rare. :-)
@vertigonix Likewise!
"Beware of excessive wishes for the New Year: nothing in life is free, not even losing weight! :-("
