"When I talk about vassals, the question is how self-determined the EP works, that is, the strength of democracy. They falsely and arbitrarily turn it into a national discourse. There should also be limits for spin doctors that they adhere to."

I said that I see Vestager as SpiKa. Where does the counter-claim come from?
There&#39;s nothing wrong with hope. ;-)
"If you had thought about it for a long time, you would have figured it out yourself: the difference between AKK and Habeck is clearer than that between Timmermans and Weber."
Rejecting the transnational lists was a grave mistake. We voted for them as Greens. But do you have to make a bigger mistake now? The solution would be: Now choose 1 SpiKa and make a firm decision in 2024 that there will be SpiKa and these lists.
With a remark you are half right. If Parliament had some position ... That&#39;s right. But it is also true that certain council actors massively hinder parliamentary agreement on vassals. On the other hand: Nowhere do I say that turnout is explained by SpiKas.
Don&#39;t overdo it! ;-)

Anyone who constantly insinuates that @ManfredWeber is somehow the &quot;bridge builder into the authoritarian camp&quot; does not want to see reality. Where did these blinders come from?
Anyone who declares the strengthening of European democracy an &quot;ideology&quot; represents a - let&#39;s say - a very special form of euro federalism.
"If you can&#39;t take the &quot;bridge building to the authoritarian camp&quot; hostage sharp enough, but don&#39;t see a particularly big problem with the presidential democracy, you have to think again."
