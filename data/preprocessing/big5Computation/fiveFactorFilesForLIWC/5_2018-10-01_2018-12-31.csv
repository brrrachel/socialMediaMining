Your short account name should appear in your tweets as a style
But that was a long time ago. So don&#39;t explain the difference between 45.8% in 1972 and 15% in polls today. Please don&#39;t make it that easy
"This is not a tweet from the SPD, but a summary of the WORLD"
"And then I would have received similar tweets from other followers on the first topic, where Linke doesn&#39;t follow SPD? Compromises are part of democracy. If you want SPD politics, you have to make SPD strong."
"I was concerned that this sentence is not suitable for your implicit thesis that the SPD &quot;neoliberalized&quot; at all, because it reflects the attitude of the original workers&#39; movement and is in line with a strong welfare state"
Exactly: you can not coalition with any party that does not have 100% the same ideas üôÑ
The article does not give your thesis
No more industrial jobs? Why do you think that?
"&quot;Those who do not work should not eat either&quot; comes not from M√ºntefering, but from the early workers&#39; movement. What was meant was that the community did not support those who could work but refuse to do so."
"No, that&#39;s why the SPD has long wanted to change the taxation right to individual allowances and to phase out special regulations such as splitting. Blocked by CDU / CSU"
"If you put more than one emoji behind a sentence, you have also lost control of your life"
"The timestamps of our two tweets prove that they couldn&#39;t even read the balance sheet superficially. So a lot of opinion, but probably very little idea about you?"
"Yes, I received 35% of the vote and won the direct mandate. That is around 60,000 votes. How many followers do you have again? 40?"
The brewery has to use the waste materials for something. Hazardous landfill is too expensive :-)
"Ok, thanks, on December 20th I switch off the main part of the website anyway"
And there is my favorite attitude again: &quot;Only my solution works. Everyone who disagrees is too stupid or corrupt or ...&quot; Do you really think that the world is so simple?

"That is why we also want collective wages, if necessary enforced by law"
Although I do not believe that air quality has to be sacrificed for more data protection supervision
"Bonn citizens, 35%, AfD 6%"
"I can tell you don&#39;t want to argue. Anyone who disagrees with you is an opportunist. Too bad you are currently lost to democracy ... bye, answers only when there is a willingness to discuss without insults"
"If you always grope around your own advertising column, you wrongly come to the conclusion that you are walled in on your only topic. And no, I will not let you change the subject, the subject was AfD demand that the death penalty for the border should happen despite deportation"
"Especially in the &quot;lower part&quot;, as you call it (terrible term), there is often great pride in moving through life with your own efforts"
"That is why we are the party to the collective agreements, including the legal enforcement of collective agreements. For many people, gainful employment is about more than just money, namely pride and dignity"
"Ignore facts, spread hatred: Too bad you seem lost for democracy and community right now"
Did you report the criminal content not deleted by @twitter to the Federal Office of Justice?
"#Factscheck 2018 fewer crimes than 2014 in D. So before the &quot;gold pieces&quot;, as you call them in 100% takeover radical right wording, came to D."
They are not up to the task and therefore insult all other panelists. That will not be Germany&#39;s future. You are an insulted outsider.
"If the shoe fits, put it on. Bye. Oh, one more thing: No, you are not the people. Luckily!"
"For the first time, renewable energies in D achieved a share of&gt; 40% in electricity production over the year pic.twitter.com/uveOqm4xLm"
"99% of those who disagree with me are not racists. Even 90% who demand faster deportations are not. From your point of view, however, you do. You are not the middle, unfortunately you are far right. Please don&#39;t radicalize further"
"You know, I&#39;m a member of a party that was the first to be persecuted by communists. A special feature of the communists: only your own opinion counts! You remind me a little of this style in these tweets. But you don&#39;t have to"
"Don&#39;t distract yourself, you want to reintroduce the death penalty. I only ask for the specific wording. &quot;For foreigners / passport Germans who kill non-foreign / non-passport German underage women from villainy&quot; obviously does not work. So, how?"
"On Twitter you can not be so sure about spelling with some, especially with German nationals :-) Sorry for the request, I did not know you before"
"I am sorry for your only subject. In addition: You are obviously not interested in the victims, but only in the country of birth of the offender or his parents / grandparents. Has always worked for some: Distract thematically with racism"
Or short version: I try to discuss with you. Just calling out opinions with insults (‚ÄúCommunist Pack‚Äù) is too little for a democracy. Please explain to me why I am immediately arrogant
"Your whole Twitter account is about refugees. They link right-wing extremist content. Fortunately, it is only enough for 40 (!) Readers"
So you started immediately with the words &quot;Insolent&quot; and &quot;Pack&quot;! I try to make it clear to you that your apartments are of great value because you benefit from society. Hence society&#39;s right to regulation. It is a discussion
So three home-made pipe bombs and flammable liquids are &quot;Polish beaters&quot; for you?
I also recommend Article 14 of the Basic Law in its entirety
Do you mean me?

What should the paragraph in the criminal code read then? How do you identify &quot;lower motivations&quot;? Doesn&#39;t the deed count?
And the community hasn&#39;t really improved anything since they bought it?
"GroKo wants to abolish solos up to 70k (for singles), CSU wants to spend ‚Ç¨ 10 billion in order to do that for&gt; 70k, too, that are &quot;top performers&quot;. Indeed, this time it is not in the article"
Do you also forego the jointly financed infrastructure that makes your apartment valuable? Or did you build in your private forest?
"True, not from the article. But as a first measure, the CSU has called for the abolition of solos for the top 5% income"
"And again, the CSU does not recognize police officers, nurses, educators etc. who do not earn more than 70,000 gross as &quot;service providers&quot;. A strange world view https://twitter.com/welt/status/1079302332775583744‚Ä¶"
"But the companies whose money went indirectly to a party could - unlike if they donate directly - deduct the membership fees from tax, right?"
Unfortunately. I meant @ThomasBstein
Thanks a lot!
Do you think the death penalty for other crimes in D is correct?
So you are also for the death penalty?

"In fact, it is about the sentence, because the AfD deputy has said and demands the death penalty. Do you want to dodge?"
I have quoted the full tweet and the full GG article. Where did I shorten?
EUR 20 billion tax relief affects the revenue side !!!
Does this mean that you reject the AfD claim as being contrary to the constitution and inhumane?

"Specifically: Are you, @a_hennecke, for being punished with death for illegal entry into Germany? Yes or no?"
And now any argument for your steep thesis?
Tweet screenshot comes from AfD MP&#39;s account. GG 102 contains only the regulation &quot;The death penalty is abolished&quot;. I am happy to accept your apology.
"That&#39;s right, but then we should agree to always measure final energy consumption"

"Primary energy is not a good benchmark for comparison, renewables are simply not so wasteful"

And my criticism was that @dorobaer wants to soften data protection again
Data protection concerns the processing of personal data. Really anonymized data or comparison data only on the patient&#39;s device (eg drug intolerance) or something else is on a completely different page
"Elimination of solos for 90% of taxpayers, calculated and financed"
"65k taxable income per person, i.e. 75k gross. So 150k for a couple, or 180k for a family of four."
"Currently about half of all taxpayers count solos. The coalition agreement stipulates that a further 90% should be fully relieved. That costs ‚Ç¨ 10 billion. Relieving the top earners would cost another 10 billion. For some CEO that would be a relief of ‚Ç¨ 180,000"
You&#39;re right

"No, not all messengers have the problem"
"My choice of words was &quot;acts&quot;, not &quot;is&quot;. Therefore, I am not referring to every component, but to individual but important components"
I know everything. You will find it compliant with data protection if you provide the contact details of a fourth / fifth / etc. Need to transfer person to WhatsApp / Facebook to form a WhatsApp group with a second and third person? That is what I am concerned with using the example
"With qualifications like &quot;ridiculous&quot; one should not deal with inflation. There are many important data protection issues, but given the prevalence, that&#39;s also an important one. Do we enforce our rules or not?"

"Current planning yes, but Twitter also has to adapt its data protection policy"
"The choice of words falls back on you and your friends. How can you use your logo (which, by the way, is also very tasteless) to promote a party full of donor fraudsters, convicted hooligans, Holocaust deniers and petty criminals?"
"With your (by the way very tasteless) logo, I had expected nothing else. If you have ‚Ç¨ 2,000 gross, you can also participate with ‚Ç¨ 100 tax. Thanks to the SPD, this amount will decrease from January 1, 2019 (higher allowance)"
"But then I see correctly that the total pension is higher than 15,700 euros, namely 23,000 to 24,000 euros a year?"

"Please read my invoice again. Abstract: surplus 10 billion annually, already established budgetary charges (more money for countries, tax relief) 30 billion annually"
The federal government probably generated a surplus of 10 billion euros in 2018. 2019-2021 will gradually go to the federal states 10 billion annually and 20 billion annually will come as tax / family relief. It is challenging. They are now demanding another 10 billion annually. For the top 5% income

"We need a majority in the Bundestag and Bundesrat, state governments without CDU / CSU participation have 22 votes, but we need 35. The SPD is fighting for a solution that will eventually become law. So with all due respect, malice is undemocratic, unfair and uninformed"

I had asked very specifically and received a blanket judgment as an answer
240 characters. Try it
"If an investor can no longer threaten to double the rent after the modernization in order to rent out, then a major problem is put an end to. If modernizations are no longer an additional business, then a major problem is put right"
"That is 6-7% return on modernization, until the financial crisis in 2007 the return was significantly lower in all years. How much return do you think should be possible?"
"#Facts check When the property tax changes as prescribed by the court, it is promised that the total volume will not change"
"You have a number of examples of brutal rent increases in Frankfurt that would no longer be possible under the new law, right?"
What is your alternative: No limit on rent increases after modernization
"Wow, 6-7% return on home modernization is not enough for you as an investor. By the way, it was never more than that until 2007. How much should it be in your opinion?"
"But now that has jumped short, investments are about construction companies, municipal planning authorities etc. In addition, you only spoke about the present (Budget 2019) and now again about the past ..."
"#Factscheck The number of completed apartments has doubled since 2013. Basic needs such as living, especially with limited resources such as space, shouldn&#39;t just be left to the market"
You have to pay renovations out of your rent anyway. Only modernizations justify rent increases. SPD had offered market interest rates + 3-4 percentage points. And please do not assume that the other person is wrong because he has a different opinion
"In my view, Straubhaar and Werner are anti-social. Left model also ignores points. In my view, still a lot of work ..."
"Exactly, I&#39;m for public research funding, but broad, not just for an institute"
Tenants in the centers benefit in particular. Because only there could landlords enforce excessive modernization costs in the past. That is now a thing of the past
"But seriously: The challenges and opportunities of 2018 are different from 2003, e.g. faster changes in the world of work, longer stays of children in basic security"
"Do we want to go through what ‚Äúsuccessful things‚Äù your CDU ‚Äúwanted‚Äù to keep over the past 70 years, for which we are both happy today that the SPD has prevailed? Should be fun :-)"

"Oh, again one of those who does not want to / cannot refute another&#39;s opinion, but rather tries to ridicule himself. And goodbye"
"Uh, no. If the modernization has exceeded the customary local rent level, the rent cannot be increased even if the tenant changes."
"If there are fewer displacement modernizations, that&#39;s a good thing. The other modernizations will continue to take place, as you can still economically modernize with an 8% surcharge"
Thank you for the trust!
"Maximum 2 ‚Ç¨. After that 6 years nothing more. No landlord will make full use of it, since he will then have to pay for any necessary modernization alone"
Please all the data of the example
#Factscheck construction industry overused. Contradicts her prejudice that it would no longer be modernized
A joke? Do you finance your renovations with 1-2% and are allowed to apportion 8% of the renovation costs? Does this mean that you have an initial repayment (i.e. yield) of 6% and call this insufficient? How much do you want to get from your tenants?
"From now on, affected customers can take part in the one-for-all lawsuit against Volkswagen free of charge (!). https://www.bundesjustizamt.de/DE/Themen/Buergerdienste/Klageregister/Allgemeines_node.html‚Ä¶ #Verbraucherschutz #Dieselgate Further complaints on other topics will follow. Good for consumers."
"It is the upper limit! And if you take that as a landlord for the modernization, you cannot make any further increases in the following years. It is a bar against modernization"
Please not so black and white. I am a landlord myself. 8% levy is sufficient to finance renovations. It is good to put an end to excessive returns and modernization
On the &quot;hardly after&quot;: record investments in the federal budget. There is already a lack of planning and construction capacities

And 45% compared to 2010
"Although I started in Siegburg / Bonn at 7:07 a.m., it is becoming apparent that I will not be able to reach my 1:30 p.m. appointment in Gera in time. The ICE is currently in Wirtheim, communication zero. For me as a train fan you are a tough test, @DB_Bahn"
"Unfortunately, no, because of the use of the ICE4, @DB_Bahn wants to go to Siegburg / Bonn less often in the future and refers to the route via Cologne"
"Now a train has stopped in front of us. Time of onward journey uncertain. Go, @ DB_Bahn, go"
Extension due to the great success: The reservation system has of course also failed on the train from Frankfurt to Leipzig (due to the delay not the train I originally booked with reservations) and the &quot;Please clear my space&quot; game starts @DB_Bahn
After 1: 45h I now reach Frankfurt airport to change there. Driving time earlier: 0:47 if I remember correctly

"More child benefit, less tax: families will have more money in their wallets in the future.

"The world today is different than it was 20 years ago, that doesn&#39;t lead to anything. And by the way, 2013-2017, 2009-2013 are 40% of that time"
Because parties that do not want to abolish the unreasonable time limit got a majority in the federal election. The SPD was nevertheless able to push through extensive abolition. Makes us stronger and the rest will follow
"If you can no longer limit the jobs, that will change. I&#39;m looking forward to the first results of 2019"
"Exactly: &quot;Wingen&quot;. Because despite the opposition from the CDU / CSU, we have managed to make the unspecified limitation of employment contracts more difficult. Step by step, not as quickly as we want, but better than just asking. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in the SPD, @Schmidtlepp"

The new report speaks of -45% compared to 2010.
Minus 55% greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 to 2030 is the climate protection target to which D has committed internationally. So it is in the coalition agreement. The climate protection law must lay down a binding path for everyone

So you have to resign before the election campaign if you run for the EP? Also if you run for a state parliament? And why not if you are a minister and want to become a candidate for chancellor?
"That shouldn&#39;t calm you down either, but explain the difference to the Paris Agreement. The 2020 targets were not abandoned in March, but due to completely inadequate climate protection policies over the past ten years. The climate protection law must reliably prevent this in the future"
"But you also deal with me in terms of content, right? Above all, because I had refuted the mistake in your argument in terms of content. I think that&#39;s how discourse should go"
The had not determined whether he would go to NRW as an opposition member. Not comparable? Or does the current Chancellor have to step down from office six months before the election?
"This is not a contradiction in the first place, a party with 100% would be rather strange"
The invitation was logically made many weeks ago. Background: Negotiations on the climate protection law will soon begin
"In my view, it will be crucial how mandatory the climate protection law will be"
"By the way, important for negotiations: the Paris Agreement provides for binding targets for 2030, not for 2020. Now important with the climate protection law, how is the path to be taken immediately in order not to determine in 2028 that the 2030 target can no longer be achieved"
"Well, as an insider, you know that such focal points at the parliamentary group meeting result in readjustments and concretizations, for example what does the binding climate protection law look like?"

"After speeches clearly: AfD, CSU, FDP and parts of the CDU do not want to spend 10 billion euros per year not for education, traffic routes, broadband and relief of families, but for a tax reduction exclusively for parts of income over 70,000 / 140,000 euros (single / couple) ,"

"When, where and how long have you tried factual arguments? And it&#39;s not about convincing Mr. Reul, but the majority of the population. And this works better with factual arguments than with insults and violence. You only get intoxicated with yourself"
Where do you get the audacity to assume that I find illegal actions to be &quot;beautiful pictures&quot;? Are you really so stuck in your attitude that you cannot endure democratic discourse?
"Yes, but the feed changes"
"Ms. @Katrininthesun, I also disagreed with the key decision at the time and keep this democratic right to myself. But even with pro-lignite farming, one should be able to wait for legal proceedings."
"I prefer rule of law solutions that are always applied in the same way. This is fought by BILD and CSU. Election by prime ministers is fairly nineteenth century, isn&#39;t it? https://twitter.com/jreichelt/status/1048319920067563521‚Ä¶"
The next choice is far away in NRW. Why do you qualify criticism of the actions of political opponents so undemocratically?
"To behave properly, not to offend people, to convince neutral people with factual arguments? Oh man, do you really have to explain that?"
"Very seriously, I loathe this form of political debate"
This did not have to fall because the opposite was the case: strengthen existing competence clusters.
"Unspeakable insults, ugh!"
What does the Left Essen actually say about their own opinion?
"Because Laschet &amp; Co. could not wait for the verdict, thousands of police officers were pulled out of the cities unnecessarily and forced to work overtime.

"Your tweets are incoherent, at least not clear to me what you actually want. You had joined a certain discussion"
Attention. Or I have to classify you as a troll and end this here
"No, you had linked to a website with a report about Vienna / Klingeln. But they always talk about judgment. So: deliver"
What judgment do you mean now? I am asking here for the second time!
I don&#39;t do it and therefore allow myself criticism
"I have never done that, not even in the Bonn City Council. What I say now and then is: &quot;This is the price for black green&quot;"
It is not about what you saw with your CDU bias or I think you saw with my SPD bias. I have quoted an article from @zeitonline_pol

"Already annoyed because you were not interested in a discourse, which I found particularly sad with this medium. I have tried to understand what you were about and answered seriously. Was that a joke or frustration for you or what?"
üôÑ
Now leave the cryptic! What case do you want to talk about? Specifically!
"If we talk about the bell on Viennese houses and you mention a judgment, do I have to assume that you mean the judgment against Ms. Maurer? The judge - wrongly in my view - argues with journalistic due diligence and not GDPR"
"It depends on the competence of the information, the Berlin authority could put it on the agenda of the German data protection conference"
"Well, as a federal association based in Berlin, I would inform the Berlin data protection officer before a public warning"
Your social media people are still spreading messages that everything is unclear ... you have to take action now
Oh and one more thing: Which word in my reaction was &quot;offensive&quot;? May also answer the retweeting President :-)
"Clarification (by the way, preferably by the responsible supervisory authority) is obtained before (!) One unsettles hundreds of thousands of owners and millions of people wrongly doubt the legislature&#39;s mind."

"German (!) Data protection authorities! If it really turns out in the end that a relevant number of data protection authorities in Europe see it differently, it has to be harmonized in the European Data Protection Committee. But this persistent alarmism is so harmful."
Why are you alarming and unsettling people? Why don&#39;t you just ask the German supervisory authorities? I bet you will get the clear answer from there that names on name tags are of course not illegal!
"You know very well that data protection legislation does not prescribe to remove name tags at all. German data protection officers have also told you so. Then why do you say the opposite? Of course, the names can stay."
That&#39;s the way it is! When do interested circles (and the media) finally stop damaging the data protection idea with false accusations and ideas? https://twitter.com/Peter_Schaar/status/1052830207726489600‚Ä¶
Doesn&#39;t the smaller one always win at Tim &amp; Jerry?
I would like a very quick decision to abolish # 219a. But GroKo has been in office for half a year. A year ago there were still black-and-green federal wink weeks
"2020 goals. Very annoying and an oath of revelation. Fight is now about the climate protection law, which should now set the binding path of actual emissions to the 2030 target. Do not resign"
"Uh, no. Calculate absolute numbers (55% 1990 and 45% 2010)"
"Above all, you shouldn&#39;t change your goals every few months, but keep your international commitments"
"Technically good hit from @c_lindner: Ms Chancellor, you appeared quite relaxed. As soon as Horst Seehofer is not in the room, everything runs a little better"
"However, R√∂ttgen did something else, he did not run in his black home constituency in the state parliament election, but chose the reddest constituency in Bonn. It was clear that he would not become a member of the state parliament"
"Yes and no. There are numerous informal discussion groups among MPs in the Bundestag. I am involved in rail noise, aircraft noise and free rivers, for example. Andrea Nahles at Reitsport, completely legitimate, she is mainly on an email list"
"And again AfD officials were caught during a Nazi pilgrimage.

If the AfD&#39;s own ideology bites its tail: AfD wants to leave all rights of the European economic area without the UK having to pay for it. Result: German EU contribution would increase
"Anyone who analyzes the coalition agreement unconditionally will find masses of points in there that the SPD has implemented, right? And as I said: without a coalition, new export permits would have been issued"
Just!
"Exactly, we should invest all of GDP in a race for low taxes for high incomes and profits. Not!"
"But it doesn&#39;t just appear in comments. Even in the last election campaign, financial viability was always questioned, only not with tax cuts for top earners. Hence my criticism of Agenda"
"Is that the one from the CSU whose recommendation in the Orb√†n vote was not followed by any other from the CSU? Incidentally, the first vote after being nominated as a top candidate üò¨"
The statistics show that it does not affect all parties equally
"Interesting: Handelsblatt therefore considers that higher tax subsidies for stable pensions cannot be financed by everyone, but demands tax cuts for the 5% with the highest incomes. One calls the &quot;left balloon&quot; the other &quot;necessary&quot;. Agenda instead of journalism?"
What is happening en masse in a country that currently ranks 3rd in the world with the current competitiveness index and 1st in Europe üôÑ
"Not half-heartedly, but compromise in a coalition, with its own 20%. The alternative would have been to stay as it was: unlimited exports"
"Exact numbers will include draft law. Most recently, it was planned to completely abolish the solos up to a gross income of 70,000 euros per year (single)"
"At the CSU and Altmaier it is blazing, if you say as a ruling party, only the coalition partner SPD keeps you from a reduction in revenue and spending increases of 70 (!) Billion euros per year from the federal budget. Why doesn&#39;t @Handelsblatt ask for numbers?"
"Altmaier, along with other tax relief and additional expenditure on defense, simply demands 70 billion euros a year, which is over 20% of the federal budget. Without debt that would be unconstitutional, that would not be possible. Untrustworthy three https://twitter.com/hb_politik/status/1050404282284081153‚Ä¶"
For everyone who thinks # get up is left
"Higher basic allowance, inflation compensation for tax rates"
Pay for what?
Relieving the burden on families strengthens the domestic economy. Why do you think that 10 billion in top earners would make a good contribution to this and be more important than other investments
"That is exactly what the SPD proposed. But with 20.5% in the election, we cannot get 100% through"
"Decides according to our constitution the municipality or the federal state, not the federal level"

"Are you a senior expert? And sure that this also applies to tampered vehicles? According to my information, the departmental level of the BMVI sees things differently"
The Federal Constitutional Court has determined that only the German Bundestag may make this decision and may not commission third parties to do so
Is it an attack now when you ask that a CSU minister should do what he was elected to do? üòé
"It is up for vote every four years, every new Bundestag has to decide again"
"Recommend minimal research or at least think before expressing prejudices: logically you cannot vote for others by name, as the term says, right?"
The government experts for the examination and the necessary data can only be found in the BMVI
"I leave the prime ministers of the group locations outside, otherwise the diesel fraction would be all-inclusive :-) https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.diesel-debatte-kretschmann-glaubt-nicht-an-hardware-nachruestung.1b248171- a1e6-4feb-bc04-3f8e049afc2d.html‚Ä¶"
"Pardon, but that&#39;s populism. Of course, the respective minister in the federal government is responsible for technical examinations and not the ministry of justice."
"Errors in the sentence. We never listened, but always advocated retrofitting and compliance with urban air limits"
"At the beginning of the debate about air quality, the diesel faction speaks (fusion of AfD, CDU and FDP). Limit values are the problem, not the cheating of the corporations. Absurd. Must: retrofits paid for by the companies, no burdens on customers, clean air for everyone"
The AfD and the Left are particularly often absent from the Bundestag. Remarkable quote from article: &quot;The AfD doubts the evaluation of the publicly available figures ...&quot; http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/abstimmung-afd-und-linke-fehlen-besonders-oft- in-bundestag-15832216.html‚Ä¶
"Like the average wages. If wages don&#39;t go up, diets won&#39;t go up. If wages fall, diets decrease. Which fairer method do you have in mind?"
The 5% with the highest taxable income in Germany. No solos will exist for everyone else in 2021.
Childcare contributions: At the beginning of October we introduced the Good Childcare Law. Countries and municipalities receive 5.5 billion euros from the federal government in order to be able to offer more educators and lower contributions
"The diets are increasing at the same rate as the average wages, by the way, I think it&#39;s fair. Incidentally, the last increase amounts to gross significantly less than EUR 2 million per year, i.e. less than 0.002% of the family relief #Factscheck"

"Because money only exists once. If we relieve families and invest and do not want to incur debt, there is simply no money for the top 5% of income in the federal budget"
"Oh man, is that really your only &quot;argument&quot;? After I showed Mr. Lindner that a) the FDP had initially approved the law he rejected and b) the CDU interior minister admitted that changes were due to the intervention of the SPD?"
a) The FDP had supported the original police law b) Reul says in the text that the ‚Äúdefusing‚Äù can be traced back to discussions with the SPD #firstread #factscheck
A party that placards against GroKo without content has to withstand something like this :-)
"May be and I look similar. Your tweet would be more credible if you would also name such contradictions in your own party, e.g. diesel, changes to the constitution, etc."
Immediate abolition? So 20 billion euros a year in the federal budget? In addition to the 10 billion euros that the federal government will also give to states from 2019 and 10 billion relief that have been decided. Where does FDP see 40 billion euros annually (!) In the federal budget? #frueherserioes
"Very well. The additional amounts of wind and solar power will be decided in the Bundestag in 2018. Then in 2019 the binding (!) Climate protection law as a milestone. It is also clear: Without an accelerated exit from coal-based electricity generation, it is not possible https://twitter.com/spdbt/status/1049242770056142849‚Ä¶"
Problem: CDU / CSU make a proposal that actually favors them. Other parties have proposed to reject the CDU / CSU. There are really a few stupid side effects (with both suggestions)

"The article speaks of &quot;Added to this are the MPs&#39; diets, which according to the report will total around 460 million euros next year.&quot; So clearly wrong, zero researched and populist"
"If that were the case (would be wrong, since there are no diets), you would still have tried to give the wrong impression. And pensions today have nothing to do with the Bundestag, which grew in 2017"

"Well, the graphics of &quot;Bavaria One&quot; deserve every ridicule that you can only imagine"

"All of these are not arguments, regardless of whether you get the best result from blind automatic funding."
"Pardon, but the accumulation of scientific institutions in the field of neurology in Aachen, Bonn and Cologne is another house number. And to the federal authorities: The location of the authorities of certain policy areas in the Bonn region is legally defined"
"But it would have been pointless, for example, to locate a dementia research facility instead of in the region, where specialists are already working at cooperating facilities"
"With an 8-3 win against Heidenheim, @BonnCapitals takes the lead in the final series #baseball #deutschemeisterschaft #bonn pic.twitter.com/Gtzeqqy9xz"

"You probably mean &quot;secured performance&quot; and not &quot;sighted&quot;? Yes, but in a world with a lot of renewable energies you need fast provision, e.g. storage and gas turbines. Slow brown coal condensation power plants are largely unsuitable for this!"
"It&#39;s like a lake from which everyone drinks. When the first begin to discharge their wastewater, their drinking water still contains pollutants from the others, but bit by bit the water in the lake becomes cleaner"
That is a sham argument. Explicit demand for certain electricity generation changes the feed into the transmission network and thus the composition.
"The automobile manufacturers refuse the polluter pays principle? Not a good idea, politics can pull reins, legally and elsewhere. And don&#39;t forget: From 1.11. start the free class action lawsuits against the manufacturers #einefueralleklage"
"Don&#39;t forget, 100% renewable energy is not just about climate protection, but also about reducing pollutants. Lignite-based electricity generation, for example, ensures 3.5 tons of mercury emissions per year pic.twitter.com/7BQShZj5zZ"
"Quite simply, the demand determines the feed-in. When green electricity providers sell more, coal and nuclear power plant operators sell less. As a suspected employee of the energy industry, you know that too, don&#39;t you?"
"Rental price brakes do not slow down modernization either, as they are not affected. Reduction of modernization levy 11% (introduced at 7% interest) to 8% more than justified"
