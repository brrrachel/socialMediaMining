Saving is not an end in itself. Saving must create room for action. Action areas for growth and future impulses.
Debt brake inevitable if we want to remain an independent state in the future.
"With debt brakes, we have committed to reducing debt levels step by step - to zero by 2020."
"Independent Saarland needs efficient universities. They belong to the core of its intellectual, economic and cultural substance"

Is it mirage or do I see Guido Peters on the press box of the state parliament?
I invite you all: go this way with us! # saarländischerweg
It is the path of partnership-based governance. It is the way of &quot;saving and creating&quot;. It is the Saarland way!
We are a strong country. Let&#39;s make sure everyone knows! #Saarland # saarländischerweg
The intensification of our economic relations was also put on the agenda through the French strategy. # saarländischerweg
Strengthening the revenue side means marketing the strengths of our business location much better than before. #Saarlandmarketing
Our Saarland has been a growth region in numerous areas in recent years! Should stay that way in the future. # saarländischerweg
Research in Saarland is not an end in itself. Aligned to the needs of the economy. # saarländischerweg
Our medium-sized businesses and family businesses make an indispensable contribution to innovation and employment.
Our industrial core is healthy and competitive in Europe as well as on the world markets. # saarländischerweg
Both universities will receive guaranteed financial planning security for the coming years of the debt brake. # saarländischerweg
With Uni des Saarlandes and the University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economy agreed on financial frameworks for 2014 and for 2015 to 2020.
The key element of our future viability is to maintain the potential of Saarland&#39;s universities in the long term.
Agreement with unions is a milestone in our country&#39;s history. # saarländischerweg
"Thanks to the unions, there was a willingness to explore such a common path."
A smaller public service should not mean: poorer performance for citizens. # saarländischerweg
"We want a country service that can fully meet its requirements, even with fewer staff."
Politics is adopting a new concept of government action. This new term is that of partnership-oriented action.
Citizens are entitled to learn why politics decides on measures.
Agreement with unions was the first important step. Many more difficult steps follow. But one thing is clear: Basta politics were yesterday.
We save and will make it more active. We make a virtue out of necessity.
"We struggle for solutions and make decisions as far as possible together with those affected, instead of just prescribing something from above."
"We pursue goals in our own way, with our Saarland path. # saarländischerweg"
