I hope that the rich will finally make their contribution so that things are fairer. Only then can we relieve the middle that pays everything. The poor cannot. And the rich are avoiding it. It can&#39;t stay that way. All the best for 2019! https://t.co/Re3hlyyFwx
"I actually wish for a different world for Christmas. But we won&#39;t get it that quickly. Let us fight together for peace, more social justice, ecological sustainability in social responsibility and more freedom and democracy. All of this is very at risk. https://t.co/zjzsUg4LiG"

#OstQuote when filling management positions? It speaks volumes that in the 29th year of unity such a proposal is still needed. It is crucial that the underrepresentation is recognized as a problem at all and that the political will to change this becomes clear. https://t.co/sNL6eWTUP0
Arms deliveries increased despite Saudi Arabia violating human rights and waging war in Yemen. A critical journalist is murdered in a consulate in Saudi Arabia. @McKinsey advises Saudi Arabia &amp; the federal government at the same time. Where should it all end? https://t.co/6w8uk31vl8
