"there were 1948 ff .: 1. 100,000 Palestinian displaced persons 600,000 refugees (followed by calls from the Arab states) =&gt; today 7 million descendants of the refugees. 2. 800,000 Jewish refugees / displaced persons from the Muslim world to Israel."
"No. It would only be a dictatorship of opinion if there were sanctions. Otherwise, it may be stupid, unfair or something."
"Do you mean the 800,000 Jews from Muslim countries?"
But the story is reversed: 1948 Arab attack on Israel. 1967 Arab advance &amp; Jordanian attack on Israel 67-70 again 1973 Arab attack on Israel etc. etc. etc.
"Both are occupied because the previous occupying power, Jordan, attacked and lost again. The crew will only end if there is security for non-repetition. Not currently foreseeable."
Kind of boring. Yes. But in my opinion it is also correct. Solidarity with the unemployed and the poor. But the basic income of the rich will finance the poor.
Which areas are illegally occupied?
"Um, did you read the article?"
what illegally occupied areas? Israel does not illegally occupy anything. Hamas operates in the former Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip and wants to destroy Israel and kill all Jews (charter).

In what way?
I read: &quot;IGMG general secretary Altas denies that his club has ever accepted the YTB&#39;s invitations.&quot; So far @igmgorg clubs have really not accepted any youth travel offers or YTB grants - as you claim?
"Whining instead of answering: have the @igmgorg clubs actually not accepted any invitations and grants from the YTB, as @BekirAltas claims?"
How can a quote from @BekirAltas be an insinuation?
I am committed to our rationale. But the religious community in whose services I go is not controlled by authorities or parties from abroad.
Why do your people tell such stuff? &quot;IGMG General Secretary Altas denies that his club has ever accepted the YTB&#39;s invitations.&quot;
That&#39;s true. It was not difficult to collect 100 pages of evidence. It was work anyway.

"Freedom is always unconditional and only finds its limits in protecting the freedom rights of others. You can&#39;t really do anything with the free order of the Basic Law, can you?"
"Impairment is not yet, I don&#39;t like to see something."

Of course - but somehow you have to start somewhere. The beginning begins with contradiction instead of looking away.
The basic conflict from 1948 is easily explained: 1. Israel wanted to exist peacefully as a Jewish and democratic state alongside its neighbors. 2. The Arab states wanted to wipe Israel off the map.

Are you so ignorant or is it a trick? Israel controls the former Jordanian-occupied West Bank and Egyptian-administered Gaza only because it successfully resisted an attack in 1967.
#willsch should perhaps be told where and how the German soldier &quot;wandered&quot; when he sang this song.

So should you punish relevance? Funny approach.
At least in the @BMI_Bund you still know the GG: Sts. Kerber emphasized that the prerequisite would be that the mosques in Germany had to meet the requirements of religious constitutional law for a body under public law. Associated with this is the right to collect taxes https://twitter.com/Volker_Beck/status/1077881708022849536…

Perhaps you should first read the Basic Law: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_140.html

No. The replacement of the state benefit means the repetition of the recurring payment obligation against a one-off compensation of its economic value. This has not yet happened. State benefits are in Article 140 of the Basic Law.

State benefits are compensation for state expropriations.
No.
The mosque tax only comes when Muslim organizations are KdÖR and want to raise them. So it is in Article 140 GG.

"I am not aware of any religion that requires their followers to wear these signs. In addition, clothing regulations and symbols are different things."
Face the story - Grand Mufti Husseini was considered an accepted representative of the Palestinian cause - even after 1945. He is a forefather of anti-Zionism.
Who cares? As long as the governing citizen doesn&#39;t snout on the street ...

"No, the murdered Jews go to the German account alone. There was no need for encouragement or complicity from the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Still there was. He is a symbolic figure for Islamic-Arab anti-Semitism &amp; anti-Zionism."
"Israel shook hands with its neighbors in 1948. Back then, could a Palestinian state have been founded in the West Bank &amp; Gaza? Didn&#39;t prevent Israel."
