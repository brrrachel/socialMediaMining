@tsghessen The CDU / FDP interviews from the weekend .... well there&#39;s plenty of punch at the Christmas markets ...

@danielmack we do that when dealing with black and yellow and also in competition with other competitors.
"It is just an internal party decision and not a &quot;mirror, mirror on the wall ...- casting&quot; otherwise we would take Jauch."
"Within the party, competition is already a directional decision between the &quot;more modernizers à la Steinbrück&quot; and the &quot;members&quot; -SHSPD!"
"Almost 200 guests in Itzehoe experience candidate competition with similarities to black and yellow competition, but a clear profile difference!"

Coalition Committee to decide on student exports. To consider such a snap idea already shows the yesterday&#39;s black and yellow selection.
Social coats as a PR idea shortly before the household debate: Smart but not smart enough. Schleswig-Holsteiners don&#39;t fall for something like that!
On the way from Bach Kiel to the Council of Elders. CDU / FDP coalition camouflages anti-social budget design by bringing forward planned U3 investments.

"Complex world-differentiated political concepts + communicative clarity - that goes together and must also, if you don&#39;t want to be a clientele party!"

@BGM_Heidekamp why? All 4 SPD candidates are better than the PHC who was dragged through to the election and also as the young aristocrat!
@monkeypenny solicit external virtual praise? With pleasure!
"This way, selection makes sense and nobody can say that they are all politically the same and only differ in their personal image - they are not true!"
"Of course, compared to competition, candidates have more unities than separators - but not only are people different, but profiles!"
In the federal SPD there is the Seeheim district - in SH there was practically no such thing so far - our hearts always beat to the left and the program too!
Nord-SPD has clear decision-making options. Not all candidates represent the previous profile of the SPD SH.Selection +++
"This time, differences in content in the political line were worked out very clearly, so there is a clear directional decision!"
"Event with SPD working groups in Neumünster was good overall, but unfortunately the ASF was not involved in the content - too bad!"

@wolfgangbaasch see you there!
CDU-Abg. Kalinka because of the slight majority pressure. With all political competition with him - brave would be steadfast!
In newspapers it says that CDA chief Kalinka in the state parliament CDU / FDP cut package wg. does not want to decline social imbalance. This deserves respect!
Snow-covered morning greeting from Bordesholm. Day with surprise potential. Music tip: Elton John &amp; Leon Russell &quot;I should have sent roses&quot;.

On the way to Malente after the citizens&#39; consultation in Bordesholm. Now it&#39;s off to the Heinemann training center.
The group&#39;s budget meeting is over: responsibility for SH. Just alternative to black and yellow selfish politics.

One wonders when reading the newspaper: Merkel is looking for salvation in sayings from black and yellow Wagenburg. This is the end time rather than strength!

"@bueti from history also comes strength and wisdom for the challenges of the future: basic values, experiences, mistakes, successes!"
@RasmusAndresen Landesverband does not interfere - but we already have an attitude towards SSW versus black-green! SSW + CDU &amp; Co .---
@RasmusAndresen also I mentioned bad black-green balance in HH and KI - towards the public - not as an SPD election recommendation
@RasmusAndresen Not so. District association does not make any election recommendations - is also a regional matter. I only referred to good SSW co-op
Schweinerei: Schwarzgelb now also wants anti-social head allowances in Pfkegeversicherung. Deselect conservative &amp; selfish from CDU &amp; FDP!
Dedicated debate on the top candidate among SPD women in Meldorf. That was a good discussion!

Great event in Niebüll. SPD dares more democracy. Next government will run SPD!

@amselwilli was a CDU decision!
"As with us, @tsghessen surveys show that people want SPD-led state governments!"
"Incredible: CSU wants anti-nuclear protesters to share in the costs of police operations, the cause of the madness are CDU / FDP + nuclear companies!"
Failure of the CDU-led governments SH and HH is obvious: cut back on the weakest to have coal for HSH bonuses + compensation for Dr.No!
"Weekend press indicates that SPD was right + HSH boss Dr.No can count on severance payments, &quot;Peanuts&quot; as Kopper would say!"
"Music tip: Gordon Lightfoot &quot;Rainy day people&quot;. Nevertheless, have a nice Sunday everyone on Twitter!"
Good morning from rainy Sunday Bordesholm. Today again public candidate round: 2.30pm Niebüll. SPD = living democracy!
@manomama sounds delicious!
CDU &amp; FDP in Berlin + Kiel: Conservatives &amp; egoists fight the common good: Motto for school or social policy is: Consistently unjust!
IG-Metall boss Huber is right: A state without justice is like a gang of robbers! Black and yellow health care &quot;reform&quot; is anti-social + shameful!
RT @SPD_amin: Was a great event with Karl Lauterbach in Neumünster. It&#39;s always an experience ... :-) That&#39;s right!

Good morning from Bordesholm. Today&#39;s youngest son is celebrating his 17th birthday. Time is running! Music tip: Ray Stevens &quot;Turn your radio on&quot;.
Christmas party of the parliamentary group with a nice program and good cooperation at the tables.
@IngoHoffmann I do it all the time and there is nothing that everyone sees the same - not even in the SPD!
"Then they praise their own unity, as if it were courageous to cut back on the weakest rather than to deal with powerful interests!"
Do not believe the black and yellow if they heat up the tension hype in the state house. They are pulling their anti-social reduction package ice cold!
@IngoHoffmann who does that? Didn&#39;t read or write anything like that!
Former SPD Justice Minister Klaus Klingner turns 75 today! Congratulations!
"Today Christmas party party. Otherwise, a lot of theater in the Landeshaus. Coalition will stand for wgPower retention - cheer afterwards!"

"Good morning from Bordesholm. After yesterday&#39;s round of candidates in Schönberg, again well attended and revealing - today parliamentary bodies."
"@IngoHoffmann I do not criticize other candidates, there are differences and everyone can see them, but we are all social democrats!"
@BGM_Heidekamp what are you dreaming of ?!
The so-called innovators are often power technocrats who perceive government as an end in itself + social democratic program as annoying.
This is one of the characteristics of the directional decision behind the selection of candidates!
"Should the course of the Northern SPD remain, or should we follow the Steinbrück advice, distance to unions + less listen to members ?!"
Public candidate round in Schönberg shows similarities compared to black and yellow but increasingly clear profile differences.
On the way to the public candidate presentation of the SPD in Schönberg / Plön district. # Become SPD +++
"Exodus from top management in Kiel failed: Plön elects district administrator, who was supported by the SPD and others. CDU treasurer Meyer misses promotion!"
The second fallover from Carstensen &amp; Co. at the expense of parents is anti-social and lies. Cheated parents can retaliate: # Deselect!
Today it goes to the origin of the parents&#39; initiative against the privatization of school transport costs in Hanerau-Hademarschen in the constituency!
Panic attack at the CDU in Hamburg: The Senate gets a shy (l) t.CDU for its &quot;successful&quot; school policy as ready for opposition as in SH!

Good morning from Bordesholm. Music tip: Bill Clinton (yes - with saxophone) &quot;Midnight in Moscow&quot;. Nice Friday!
The blind money reduction will be voted on in the state parliament on Wednesday - the SPD has decided to reject that by name vote. Many other items too!
@CarstenAlbrecht that&#39;s also wrong!
@CarstenAlbrecht what cuts are meant?
"At the successful fan project of the VFB Lübeck, talk about youth social work in the district of Buntekuh."
Dedicated interlocutors promote political insights for MdL colleagues Rother and me. Worthwhile visit!
Interesting visit to the constituency in Lübeck from the Bugenhagen family center to the Broschek web offset company - good discussions and impressions!
"@Truck__Driver not really, but arguing about the right course can be productive as long as what majority decides-sound important!"
@wolfgangbaasch Are you in the other city?
"Ending self-inflicted chaos for months celebrates black and yellow regularly as a feat whether University of Lübeck, host school agreements etc. Deselect!"
Months of tugging about host school agreements HH-SH finally ended.Now CDU fuselage + CDU / FDP praise themselves instead of shame towards parents
"Today with his colleague Rother in his Lübeck constituency, in the evening event on the topic of politics and the Internet at the University of Hamburg."
Troche makes it 1-0. Only HSV !!!

@juliaspreen is right!
@kleinkram I&#39;ll do it too - unfortunately it doesn&#39;t look like a Social Democratic victory!
@kleinkram nevertheless for the good - at least virtually from north to south! Twitter has to make a quantum leap before real encouragement!
@BGM_Heidekamp I&#39;m calm - I&#39;m happy about black sympathy for who will be the next red MP!
@BGM_Heidekamp if someone has reason for nervousness - then black and yellow. No- but came from Berlin.
@ chromberg5000 maybe not quite so - but more democracy for members already - great process for SH SPD!
Now back to Berlin for the group leader conference. A24 by night with JJCale CD and nice people on the timeline!.:}

The black and yellow nuclear deal is actually something like &quot;political corruption&quot; - not from individuals but from an entire coalition!
Black and yellow are the warning signs of nuclear dangers. CDU / CSU &amp; FDP = nuclear parties: Attack on exit consensus harms people!

@ victor5679 that does not change anything about Seehofer&#39;s fishing pull on the right.
It&#39;s not courageous to be fooled about foreigners as a CSU politician. Swiss journalist Köppl defends Blocher&#39;s &quot;striker style&quot;.
"@arne_de I have - and? Referendum is not undemocratic, is it?"
To say clearly what is and what you stand for is necessary - to stir up prejudice and resentment remains indecent and irresponsible agitation!
