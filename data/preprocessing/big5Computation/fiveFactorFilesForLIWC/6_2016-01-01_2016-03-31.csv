a very snotty and nervous julia kl√∂ckner in @DLF this morning. # planA2 was blown up in the air within 48 hours ...
@ DanielNag3l @sigmargabriel measures were agreed between the party chairmen and decided in the first asylum package and soon in the second.
"kl√∂ckner&#39;s plan A2 is nothing new, but one thing above all: a settlement with the inactivity of the maizi√®res #union crisis"
@flueke am still young ... @RA_Haenel @ErhardScherfer

@TimSchmuckall @MlleYs clear. and silly quarrel is silly.
@TimSchmuckall @MlleYs yes I realize. still have to pull together.
read interview with gerhard schr√∂der. read interview by stephan because. note: I like to be a Lower Saxony social democrat. #spdnds
@TimSchmuckall @MlleYs so please. compromises are negotiated and the next day comes from Bavaria. annoying.
@AlexSchestag @MlleYs we are one! ;)
"@TimSchmuckall @MlleYs nope, but it shouldn&#39;t be silly. be silent and cheer at the party conference and do politics via TV and print?"
@AlexSchestag @MlleYs are no time for ducking away right now!
"@AlexSchestag @MlleYs that is whining. you are a pirate, so responsible. just as you blame me for the SPD."
"@AlexSchestag @MlleYs the pirates will do everything right after moving into the Bundestag, without compromise and determined! oh wait ..."
@AlexSchestag @MlleYs we enforce our content. without the Punch and Judy show like other parties.
@AlexSchestag @MlleYs I would also like to live in such a black and white world. how to get there?
@AlexSchestag @MlleYs very simple world. and then with the crazies of the left party?
"Signature collections in the CDU against the chancellor, daily fire and plump populism by the CSU - it&#39;s getting annoying!"

@Heiner_Ot @hahnflo where should he have said that?
"ey, @hahnflo with you is that a firm responsibility? # csu armaments politician pic.twitter.com/RWAoHC5v6x"
@Haetscher thank you;)
@BoyBlock don&#39;t think so.
The new Polish government is also very questionable within NATO! I criticized that in @DerSPIEGEL http://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/klingbeil-kritisiert-warschau-wegen-vorgangs- gegen-nato-einrichtung-a1295848.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter‚Ä¶
