Whether the #SPD&#39;s proposals for the reform of the welfare state are credible can be seen from the fact that it makes them the subject of #Groko and is ready to seek new majorities for its proposals. We need a dialogue with unions and social organizations. @b_riexinger
The # SPD concept for the welfare state is partly written off by us. Minimum wages of ‚Ç¨ 12 and basic child protection are long positions of the #LINKEN. But those who want further sanctions have not left #HartzIV behind. @b_riexinger

‚ÄúThe fact that &#39;unreasonable and unworthy sanctions&#39; should be abolished cannot hide the fact that the SPD basically wants to maintain the right to sanctions. The Damocles sword of fear of existence still hangs over everyone who relies on Hartz IV benefits. &quot;
"‚ÄúHowever, when it comes to the rights of those affected by Hartz IV, it remains arrested in the dark age of Hartz IV repression. The much too low Hartz IV rule rates should not be increased. The construct community of needs remains untouched. &quot;"
"&quot;When it comes to partnership-based working time models, the right to inaccessibility and the fight against the exploitation of the self-employed, then this paper contains state-of-the-art formulations.&quot;"
"The SPD welfare state paper has &quot;light and shadow, but unfortunately no departure from the Hartz IV sanction system&quot;, says @katjakipping."

"I want to put the social question in the foreground. 112 million people in #Europe are at risk of poverty. We need social standards in Europe, e.g. a minimum wage. The #EU has prevented social standards from being subject to public procurement law. @OezlemADemirel pic.twitter.com/X59cyd8hQV"
"Regarding #SPD and # Greens, I say: We parties to the left of the Union have a duty to enable a progressive government alternative. This is our responsibility towards history, people&#39;s concerns today and future questions. @katjakipping"
"Courageous climate protection, a social awakening, the entry into peace and relaxation policy - all of this requires a strong left. That&#39;s why we want to grow. So we have to invite potential allies to explore possible common goals and ways to get there. @katjakipping"
"What is actually pending? To show that we really want to win and to spark enthusiasm for what is possible. We are still far from that. Therefore, it is first necessary to arouse curiosity as to what a basic alternative can look like. @katjakipping"
We have good concepts to offer. Our tax concept is calculated and stands for guaranteed protection against poverty and for the better off of the middle. Our alternatives against the nursing emergency and against explosion of rents are impressive. @katjakipping
A fundamental change of government is difficult to imagine. But the following is decisive for me: The shift to the right also draws its strength from fainting experiences. Capitalism has reached a destructive point where &quot;keep it up&quot; is forbidden. @katjakipping
The influence of the top ten thousand is immense: the power potential of the western world is used for wars. Large internet companies dominate cyberspace. That is why we need another government that bravely attacks this concentration of power. @katjakipping
"I am not interested in small-scale reforms, and certainly not in adaptation. Rather, it&#39;s about turning the tiller and attacking the concentration of money, power, and knowledge in the hands of a few. @katjakipping"
"We have to start making a real change in politics and government. Not as a rhetorical gesture and not furtively, but with a serious expression: we want to take power - not as an end in itself, but to change something fundamentally. @katjakipping"
In 2019 it&#39;s time to take sides. Only such a change of direction can ban the danger from the right and prevent the development of authoritarian capitalism a la Trump. It&#39;s about nothing less than that. The LEFT is ready. @b_riexinger pic.twitter.com/IeocaylAni
"Our campaign #rentalpayable hits the point. I am pleased that our demand for expropriation of the large real estate groups such as #Vonovia and #DeutscheWohnen gets a tailwind: In #Berlin, a majority supports the expropriation of private real estate groups. @b_riexinger"
We don&#39;t leave climate protection to the # Greens. We combine the # coal exit with an income and employment guarantee for employees and investments in sustainable regional economic development. @b_riexinger
"People&#39;s work is so productive today, society so rich that a new relationship between work and life has long been possible: work can revolve around life rather than having to focus on work as a whole. @b_riexinger"
"The conservative Seeheimer district in the #SPD is now demanding, like DIE #LINKE, a #minimum wage of 12 euros. It is a step in the right direction. But: we will not give up before the step from paper to reality is successful! @b_riexinger"
The other parties talk about flexibility and balance. These are empty formulas that hide the &quot;keep it up&quot;. Our answer to #digitalization is: wages that are enough for a good life and working hours that are suitable for life! @b_riexinger
For a social awakening and courageous climate protection! It is about translating a new democratic passion and solidarity into new majorities.
