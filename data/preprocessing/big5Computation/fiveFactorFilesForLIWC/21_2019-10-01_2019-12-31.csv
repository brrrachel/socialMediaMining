Remembering the gruesome chapters of German history in the 21st century is part of the DNA of the Federal Republic. Those who hide these chapters mock the victims of the Nazi regime and SED dictatorship.

Today Jamal #Khashoggi is murdered. UN special investigator @AgnesCallamard is clear: All states could &amp; should react to this taboo violation. Also #Germany. So when is international law enforcement finally coming? Far-reaching sanctions? https://sz.de/1.4619150

"Find G√ºndogan&#39;s distance and photo together. It&#39;s not about German-Turks swearing off Turkey. It is about a commitment to our democracy. From all.

Is there already a reaction from the SPD?

"Anyone who, like Trump, sells his previous Kurdish allies in #Syria, would also be prepared to let Poland &amp; Balten jump the blade in an emergency. Consequence: Putin&#39;s encouragement to military adventures &amp; problem for #EU that is not prepared for it."
In the press I read that we @Die_Gruenen are for &quot;more radical climate protection&quot;. I see it differently. Find it radical to further weaken a weak #climate protection law against better knowledge. @Cducsubt &amp; @spdbt are currently radical for me: radical unwilling to act!
"Everything is right, but police officers who run for right-wing extremist &amp; racist Bernd H√∂cke in #Thueringen for #noafd are just as inconceivable to me as credible representatives of our state, like an active Islamist in state services.

Anti-Semitism &amp; Racism are deadly reality in our country. Admitting that hurts. All the more so: the fight against the right will never be over.

I can only agree with Claus Christian Malzahn: The statement made by the Thuringian coalition agreement that the GDR was &quot;consequently a #unlawful state&quot; has lost none of its validity. https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/debatte/article201618260/Kommentar-Unrechtsstaat-was-sonst.html‚Ä¶
