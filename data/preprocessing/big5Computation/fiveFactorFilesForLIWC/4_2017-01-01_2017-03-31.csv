". @ petertauber: At this point, clearly state what this is all about: We help the #SPD to solve a problem that it has"
. @ petertauber: Another important topic this week is the remuneration of managers.
". @ petertauber: Candidate Schulz is the man who talks badly about our country, paints a false and bleak picture and stokes envy: we don&#39;t."
. @ petertauber: Candidate Schulz wants to be forgiving of debtors and soften rules in the EU: we don&#39;t want that.
. @ petertauber: Candidate Schulz is the man who wants to bring Turkey into the EU: we don&#39;t.
". @ petertauber: old wisdom counts: If it gets too hot in the kitchen, you shouldn&#39;t become a cook"
. @ petertauber: But he will have to put up with the fact that he will be judged by his actions and statements.
. @ petertauber: The CDU will remain fair in this election campaign and will not attack the candidate Schulz as a person.
". @ petertauber: Encouragement is needed in these times, not bad speakers."
". @ petertauber: We expressly thank Joachim Gauck, who served our country for 5 years in an outstanding manner as Federal President."
