@AppelPatrick Thanks! And a good twosome!
@ReneKirch Thank you! why are you all still awake? :-)
@ 100ProReNewable I am pretty much the only federal politician who has discussed 100 times with @orangesolar. Now it&#39;s @sigmargabriel&#39;s turn
@TimSchmuckall @Philipp_ElJana But you have to find your way without me! ;-)
@orangesolar Somehow you understand that I will not respond to such clumsy and false statements.
@SylviaLoehrmann @dunjahayali Un that Kölsch leaves and also! :-) #Altstadt
@MattinBerlin And that you have given your people free will certainly be happy too!
@MattinBerlin @larsklingbeil Thank God you wrote it on the E de with just a &quot;t&quot;! :-)
@Ralf_Stegner I appreciate your absolutely enthusiastic manner! :-)
@larsklingbeil :-))! You have to be able to!
@IngerPhil Just like this: Frank Schirrmacher invited me in 2011 to write 1 whole page in the FAZ on the subject of internet and politics -
@harnong And vice versa! :-)
The really great thing is that our team not only scored goals but also played football! :-)! #GERPOR
"@stefanolix @dominikwind You can certainly appreciate and praise someone, even if you don&#39;t agree on every point!"
Without Frank Schirrmacher we would know less about the Internet and the debate about it would not have been half as exciting and beautiful! Thank you.
@WirrerWesten Because the athletes&#39; community is international and preferably communicates in this language on social media. :-)
"Big Rehlingen-Meeting-Stadion-record for @ChristianReif: jumped 8,00 m and was enormously cheered by all People there!"
@Julian_Reus Great. I&#39;ve been there for 20 years (my constituency). Great performance of the athletes at the temperature!
Congratulations to a great team!
Congrats to @Julian_Reus for great performance 200m (20:44) at Rehlingen-Meeting today!
@navalia @the_necrosis @flueke No question! Now you just have to choose it!
@elefantenruesel Since Sue estimate me wrong Run: Something from ...
@flueke Exactly!
@NiceBastard @andikynast Well suspected! : /)
@flueke Already possible. But that we would ever limit that to &quot;1&quot; child ...
@flueke What does that mean again? We are so open! But really! Just try it out! ;-)
"Really good meeting in the Chancellery with the Parliamentary Advisory Council on Sustainable Development! Cross-party and cross-party. ,"
@simonscherrer Unfortunately a little kink in logic: who is for the EU does not have to be a centralist! D is also federal! :-)
Despite the Eurosceptic populism: there is a large pro-European majority in the EP. I regard that as an order from the voters!
Despite some eurosceptic populisme: there is a large pro-European majority in the EP! Let' s make the best of it!
Despite all the populists from right and left: there is a large pro-European majority in the EP! We have to use them now!
@RobertRossmann As long as it is not the other way around ... :-)
Congratulations from Berlin to Georg Maringer for being elected mayor of Hülzweiler!
@em_leeb always!
@Martinned81 @demsoc Quite a lot! :-) the french Revolution has changed the World!
"France survived the Monarchy, the Empire and 3 wars. She invented Revolution and Democracy. The FN will only be a brief moment"
"Looks like this: CDU / CSU clearly the strongest party in Germany, EPP clearly ahead in the EU! Clear order for the future of Europe!"
@ mapro67 @Glamypunx @wiwo_pol I would not have imagined so bad!
@ manubee777 ???? You are blocked.
The vote of the presidents of almost all EP-groups in favour of @JunckerEU is the beginning of a democratic (r)evolution: History in making!
"As Foreign Secretary, my friend @martinlidegaard is as passionate and convincing as ever. I really enjoyed our meeting: Europe at its best!"
@Ralf_Stegner Cheers!
With friends at &quot;Sloppy Joe&quot; in Berlin and playing football: a dream!
"@orangesolar If I see it correctly, I am the only one who praises the new PV. Since I am no longer a BMU, everything should be better!"
"@orangesolar Not at all. However, the goals are not low, but in such a way that we can make the energy transition affordable by 2050."
"Hello @StateDept @usbotschaft, congratulations from the Federal Chancellery on 30 successful years ppp - CBYX! #CBYX"
"@ ThomasGermany01 well, hopefully the greater the joy! :-)"
@ victor5679 :-)) will come when I have spoken :-))
"With Elke Hannack, the new DGB vice! pic.twitter.com/76VvpD4E1y"
"At the CDU evening from the DGB Federal Congress, I put on grand coalition clothing: a lot of black with a subtle red touch! :-)"
". @ christiansoeder negotiations started under red / green October 4th / 5th 2005, Angela Merkel was only on November 22nd. elected Chancellor."
. @ christiansoeder What hit me was the false accusation that the CDU had started accession negotiations with Turkey. Was falsehood. 1.2
@ _Josh96 no question! :-))
"No, @MartinSchulz is not a populist and doesn&#39;t talk to people! No no. It just looks like this! Looks like it. :-)"
@JunckerEU: Those who ban Twitter are not ready to join! #tvduell
"@orangesolar Oh, you still exist! They were so quiet the last time (compared to my term as bmu) :-)"
@AngelaNahles But you are too! So what of !!!!!
@MKreutzfeldt It&#39;s about braking the rise (# electricity price brake). it is difficult to stop if we want to increase the share of renewables!
"@flueke Not at all, @JunckerEU is just very focused - we need people to think before they talk!"
Jean-Claude Juncker in #tvduell super factual and personable: he can do Europe!
"Jean-Claude Juncker: &quot;No one is illegal, but there are illegal immigrants.&quot; #tvduell #with Juncker"
@mariarotter :-)
Jean-Claude Juncker: We&#39;ve had enough wars in Europe! But we&#39;re putting pressure on Ukraine #tvduell
"@LongoFL unfortunately the bankruptcies started when the PV with 7.7 GW was at its peak. I am for the Primary, unfortunately you did not understand anything."
"@LongoFL Ever thought ?: If @sigmargabriel #Rainer Baake and @peteraltmaier agree, there should be reasons"
@UdoSieverding Are they ripe again? Just unbelievable! :-) happy Easter! Maybe the Easter bunny can help me bake cakes
@tonifischer Thank you! You must have been on a bike! With the weather ...
"Far from agreeing with everything, but @MKreutzfeldt&#39;s book brings momentum into the debate about the path to the energy transition!"
@sven_giegold @EPP Why did the Greens get so few votes at # BTW13?
"@ mapro67 As a minister of the environment, I have already said everything about the nuclear power plant: exit is exit. Point."
@sven_giegold Europe would only belong to one color - it would have already lost !! :-)
"@orangesolar Halving the extension was wanted by the CDU, SPD, FDP, green. With 7.5 GE year, we would have installed 100 GW by 2025. Madness!"
"@pv_forum So, So! I tweeted a lot, but I largely leave the energy transition to the Federal Minister of Economics!"
@AngelaNahles @OlafScholz We did that especially for you !!!!!
"@stefanolix but not because of the energy transition, because the rail was largely exempt from the levy"
@Marlies_Uken all over. Completly wrong. Broadcast is recorded! :-)
"@phillukas Sure, we have all the buck in the world in the CDU :-)"
"From Goethe to Luke Skywalker: @petertauber rocks the # cdupt14 with wit, depth and sympathy!"
@MiKellner Thank you! That had to be said! :-)
@ JPS_11_07_1997 Then have fun !!!
"@ Tafkat69 Journalists are wrong more often, it is often not noticed! :-) @robinalexander_ can rely on successful revival!"
@UdoSieverding concessions from everyone because we can&#39;t afford a failure! :-)
Today very good conversation between chancellor and vice chancellor with the countries on the EEG reform: #GroKo is fun!
