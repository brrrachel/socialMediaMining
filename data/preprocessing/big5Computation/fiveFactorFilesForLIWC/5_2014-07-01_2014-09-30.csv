Good Morning!
@ullwer Read newspapers in front of and behind :-)
@svenlehmann Every computer-aided translation program is more accurate :-)
I&#39;ve retweeted @ullwer @BILDblog very often. And even like to do a #Factscheck with other newspapers
The difference: SPD against arbitration in trade agreements. Greens against trade agreements. Left party against negotiations about it
"@ullwer I have to know too, is part of the job"
Dear @BILD: Why are advertisements from highly dubious financial market companies so big for you? Danger to your readers!
"@Luegendetektor Take a look at studies that show how it works, for example that of the Council of Experts on Environmental Issues"
Now the plenum is about the daycare law and parental allowance plus # good for families
"@schatzbln it&#39;s not about ratifying, but about agreements with which they are enforced!"
"@Luegendetektor Exactly! But we have to be careful: when we get to the edge of the world, we fall down"
"What the cartoonist forgets: As is well known, elephants are afraid of mice http://www.stuttmann-karakteren.de/karessin_5384.html…"
"Seehofer says about independence: class, then according to the Bavarian constitution many foreigners today are immediately Bavaria"
Renewables are ahead of lignite for the first time in electricity generation. Great success at the beginning of 2014 http://www.manager-magazin.de/fotostrecke/energielösungen-in-deutschland-sinkt-fotostrecke-117635-3.html…
@BundesstadtBonn is a laureate in the @bmub competition &quot;Municipal Climate Protection&quot;. Congratulations and keep it up
"@hausundgrund_de Should this happen, it only proves the need for a permanent (!) rent brake on re-letting"
"Threats @hausundgrund with rent increases are nonsense: With new rentals, whatever is possible is taken and otherwise there is already a brake"
@katjadoerner Can&#39;t say loud enough @sven_kindler
"@Liese_Mueller No, you don&#39;t jump over every stick that someone is holding out to you"
"@neuthfer The second, but also standard setting by others, to which we would have to adapt without participation"
"@Schiebulski Please, no accusations in public, otherwise it will become a legal process and politics must stay away"
"Federal Justice Minister @HeikoMaas introduces reform of criminal law and sexual criminal law to protect children, above all, against sexual exploitation"
After discussion at &quot;Migration advice for adults&quot; now panel discussion at International Conference in Consumer Research
. @ Alex_Neubacher + @DerSPIEGEL would have preferred to research current consumer research results. Articles full of prejudice and ideology
Now visit the Hennef research station Wiesengut of the Institute for Organic Agriculture at the University of Bonn
"@J_Waetzmann We both take stock at the end of 2015, agree?"
"@J_Waetzmann No new loophole, but existing regulation. Every bet: With&gt; 90% of leases in metropolitan areas, # rent brake applies"
"So far, many banks have disregarded transparency rules and earned from overdrafts. New duties necessary! http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/umptionerminister-maas-orgt-oeffständig-liste-fuer-dispokredite-a-994193.html…"
# lpt14 of the NRWSPD in Cologne. Strong speech from @HanneloreKraft that punishes all media speculation. @ArminLaschet frustrated because of. Survey
@MSchroeren But you&#39;re a conversational talent
@trebbianos I think the EU&#39;s secrecy is wrong. But CETA is now public and TTIP is not finished paper
@smegworx Probably not at the moment. Denied EU Commission. Advisory board at the BMWI should compensate for this
@WillingThomas Wrong! 1. SPD already in this position in 2013 2. SPD will vote in the EP this way 3. we want vote in nat. parliaments
@ sebh1995 but? Example? Is it already in an interim result?
@maklerpal&#39;s EU Commission and federal government currently assess this differently
@ullwer 90% solutions must be allowed in real life
"@ullwer @svenlehmann No, that would be grayscale. I am for color! So negotiate trade agreements and fight arbitration"
"@JoergRupp Yes, but only the last survey, because it only takes months to set the mood and then increase the values shortly before"
@ullwer No! I need to know what my topics are there because other media / citizens are addressing me. Still critical
"@maklerpals In the end, you no longer have to believe, but then you know it. Negotiations are now underway!"
@svenlehmann your question - black and white confirms my summary from earlier
@ FrankBaumann80 But only because I really appreciate the @sven_kindler
And again serious demos refute the Forsa nonsense http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm…
"@ pant3r nonsense, it&#39;s only about the content. However, the lack of transparency of the EU Commission is really super annoying"
"@christiansoeder nonsense, it is legally controversial. This is not uncommon @ pant3r"
@sven_kindler My wife even forbids me to wear red jeans. Prevents me from making a fool of myself
"@christiansoeder If the EU Parliament rejects, national parliaments no longer need to vote."
@christiansoeder ?????? EU Parl. decides on his affairs. National parliaments on their. And then &quot;mixed deals&quot;
"@Europolitics Because, as a person, I am accountable to my voters and voters, as I (!) Voted"
"@sven_kindler but a lot of red, you have to admit"
"@christiansoeder For decisions at the European level. In #TTIP and #CETA, however, national issues are also clearly affected"
@sven_kindler You should style your profile picture in black and white :-P
"Left Party and Greens assume a lot today. Before the next election, the result (!) #TTIP and #CETA will be voted on"
We are doing our utmost to coordinate national parliaments on #CETA and #TTIP. EU cannot decide that alone
@BMZ_Bund I just read &quot;Gerd alone is not enough to change the world&quot; :-) But it is a good start
@W_SK You are mistaken. Why don&#39;t you accept that we want to finish negotiating first? #glasklar
@Europolitics Transparent: Vote by name and on a concrete result @sven_kindler
I take note that @W_SK and @sven_kindler believe that they can assess agreements without knowledge of the result and opinion of EU partners
"@FlegelFred Right: Arbitration courts undemocratic. If there are 27 other member states for specific regulation, we have to weigh it up in detail"
@woksoll #Factscheck: Advisory board at @BMWi_Bund transparent. On the topic of &quot;ignorance&quot;: don&#39;t you have it a size smaller?
"@ Worldview No, why also? We negotiate through the government we support and vote on the result (!) @Mehr_demokratie"
@W_SK is ready to be read. Tip: Not every question is asked so wisely that you can answer it with yes or no
"@annmeiritz Geraune, because the colleague is talking anyway"
"@ferittemizel Have fun with your clumsy and insulting prejudices against politicians, but without further answers from me"
@BabettesChefin @Oliver_Krischer @ToniHofreiter - judging by the facial expression - not even half the green fraction sees it that way
"@FlegelFred CETA simply reject difficult, agreement of 28 member states necessary. In addition, analysis regulations urgently"
"@FlegelFred lack of transparency of big mistakes EU Commission, tries to compensate @sigmargabriel with a broad advisory board"
"@sven_kindler No, for example: First analyze carefully, then talk to EU partners and ultimately vote transparently on the result"
@woksoll The fact check includes research: TTIP intermediate statuses are EU document @BMWi_Bund and tries to compensate for their lack of transparency
@thodenk So far @cducsubt has remained stubborn
"@EmsDiti For municipalities 5.5 billion relief annually by taking over basic security. Now an additional 1 billion annually, 2017/18 Participation Act"
@MariaKlSchmeink I could have bet you would say that :-) @sven_kindler @W_SK
Unfortunately @thodenk @cducsubt currently rejects live streams. But council of elders will soon discuss this
@sven_kindler Tell the @Oliver_Krischer
@neuthfer Less trade for an exporting country like Germany. Wasted opportunity for standards that will then probably apply worldwide
@sven_kindler We&#39;ll show it then. We then weigh up between the concrete results
"oh, @Oliver_Krischer, at the beginning of the week you&#39;re still complaining about boring debates. And today, when @sigmargabriel brings it to life"
"@sven_kindler That&#39;s right, but the colleague still has a turn anyway, @sigmargabriel could only react like that @annmeiritz"
@_Worldview The left would not agree to the umpteenth request to condemn the SED injustice @more_democracy
@BabettesChefin Or do you always look so sullen when the @ToniHofreiter talks? :-P
@_Weltanschauung @mehr_demokratie Because we don&#39;t have to decide everything again and again at the request of the opposition. The aim was only to demonstrate
"Left Party: BMVW rejects TTIP. #Factscheck: Like the SPD, BMVW rejects arbitration. But advocates trade agreements"
@schatzbln Do you seriously believe that in the WTO we can achieve better social / environmental / social results with Chinese and Russians?
"We reject arbitration in trade agreements. With TTIP there is still a chance to prevent it, with CETA it is more difficult"
Left Party / Greens are now demanding something that the government / SPD have already done. We do not participate in the game
"Left Party rejects paper SPD / DGB on trade agreements. But put it up for a vote in parliament today and yes, the SPD is embarrassing"
@ferittemizel social city program. Pension subsidy of over € 80 billion alone. Please do your research before criticizing
@EmsDiti But that&#39;s not a rescue program for municipalities either. But a support of special programs in hot spots!
. @ sigmargabriel is right: Whoever demands rules for globalization may not want to end negotiations on trade agreements
@NielsNauhauser Very right!
@phillukas @sven_kindler and the Greens today insist on voting without specialist debates and hearings. So just show
"The new legal and consumer policy spokesman, Johannes Fechner! pic.twitter.com/UQd8hyVKWW"
Hello @sternde: Survey here unfortunately results in a majority against my 2025 candidacy as candidate #ThemenohneSinn
@EmsDiti It is a program for new impulses and not the only one. What is the talking about?
"@sven_kindler If you were serious, intensive discussions in specialist committees would have to take place before (!) the vote. So show after all"
"On the initiative of the SPD, the &quot;Social City&quot; program was increased by 275% to € 150 million #sogehtPolitik"
"Round of Parliamentary State Secretaries in the Chancellery, followed by the establishment of a cross-sectional working group on consumer policy for the SPD"
"Good morning, full program in plenary today. And nonsense application left party that operates instead of content at TTIP / CETA show"
That I would write that: The best thing for @BILD to inform its readers about # rent brake and # ordering principle
"@JrCompanyBonn I don&#39;t want to allow applications to access my profile, sorry"
@JrCompanyBonn Unfortunately I probably can&#39;t make it due to scheduling reasons

@Winfried_Kropp Right! But capping first letting would not have been possible
@_Weltanschauung @mehr_demokratie In the Economic Committee opposition proposals with demonstration effect and not trade agreements to vote
"@schatzbln @der_ypsilon At TTIP we are still in the negotiation, but so far no rejection of this request"
@schatzbln I am still waiting for the first answer: Do you think you can make ILO standards binding with Chinese / Russians in WTO?
"@_Weltanschauung @mehr_demokratie Can you just listen to the debate? Then you would also hear the opposite, in writing for a long time"
@der_ypsilon @schatzbln CETA: ILO minimum standards binding! We have been trying in vain for decades in the WTO
@schatzbln Do you want to move something or just wave your party political flag violently?
@diapolo You can&#39;t have every law on the first day of a government. There are already deadlines for consultation
"Good Morning! Today, among other things, talks on the rent brake"
@andreas_lenz is in the decision of the party convention on Saturday and has just been repeated by @sigmargabriel for the umpteenth time in parliament
@ferittemizel Wo?
"@Winfried_Kropp Not necessary everywhere. The relatively few new buildings cannot be a gateway, numerically enough"
"Even if Greens / Leftists give another impression: Today there is no vote on a trade agreement, only on opposition proposals"
@Winfried_Kropp 42 million braked existing apartments against a few hundred thousand exceptions. Plus signal for invest in new building
A good day for the tenants. SPD and CDU / CSU agree on details of the # rent brake
"@Liese_Mueller We do not vote against the exclusion of arbitration, but against baton requests from the opposition"
"@SPIEGEL_Top You misunderstood the 5-year period! Does not refer to the exception of new buildings, but to the comprehensive law"
@auchmorgen I am not a member of the relevant committee!
@much morning household week was last week. But now budget discussions in the specialist committees

@m_fiedler That&#39;s right. Hence standardized information in a standardized place @Alex_Neubacher @DerSPIEGEL
"Hello @Alex_Neubacher, are you at International Conference in Consumer Research? It&#39;s also about a differentiated consumer mission statement"
@chris_vua Mietspiegel = All rent changes in the past four years
@TWollersen increase in inventory now goes up to comparative rent. So no advantage when the rental price brake comes into effect
Dear opposition: Tenancy law does not allow (!) To &quot;get everything out&quot; before the rent brake. On the basis of &quot;local comparative rent&quot;

Good Morning! Today we continue with the budget consultations
"@ArminLaschet You talk about Gabriel, who insists on the bill, and are silent about Merkel, who announces the toll. Party goes on land"
@ArminLaschet Have you already set yourself up for permanent opposition? Department involvement was at the specialist level on legal and factual issues.
Polish president talks about fear of Russia. Left: &quot;Warmonger&quot; Kauder on humanitarian aid. Left: &quot;Saber rattles&quot; #Pawlow
"@ArminLaschet You make a show about key points, we first comment on a bill that also adheres to the coalition agreement. That&#39;s how you govern"
Merkel: The toll is coming @ArminLaschet: toll is a project of the CSU and SPD (!)
"Um, @katjadoerner, even draft speakers in a coalition government are compromises @TerryReintke @Manuela"
The climax of hypocrisy in the Bundestag: @GregorGysi vehemently insults #groko for the Iraqi arms deliveries that he initially demanded
To dismiss @TerryReintke @katjadoerner coalition compromises as &quot;buckling&quot; is undemocratic. 100% only in opposition @ManuelaSchwesig

@KaiHWar excuse. Their claim was that the reduced rent payment was itself an economic damage. Does it stay that way?
@GordonRepinski Just a stone&#39;s throw away :-) @NielsAnnen @kahrs @larsklingbeil

An important argument: Humanitarian aid in Iraq is only possible where the advance of IS has stopped
@ArminLaschet SPD has made it clear that Dobrindt needs approval from the states / municipalities. And he doesn&#39;t have that. You have to go there
Black and green have been responsible for Bonn&#39;s household for five years: more and more debts. @gabonn allows escape of responsibility
"@ArminLaschet CDU / CSU should agree on a proposal, we will evaluate it. So far only half-baked"

My tweet about Peter Gauweiler caused his reaction and a continuation on FB https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=606496476134934&amp;id=120875131363740…
Summer is when a newspaper brings a report for the second time :-)
Nice concert to celebrate 125 years of the Beethovenhaus Bonn association pic.twitter.com/FAnJmpvMZF
Finally I got in touch with Marx &amp; Engels again. Even if it was chairman and managing director of a business association :-)

@ Bastifantasti49 I know that too. But a deputy would become my job 14 years ago. With 100% of the votes ...
@blogoli I am not signing a petition to a body in which I sit. I am there for my opinion
"So agreed: Better rental price index, fairer cost distribution with energetic modernization @heikomaas http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/mieten-maas-plant-kosten-deckel-bei-modernisierungen-a-983218.html…"
Good Morning
@Tim_Acht One
@erik_donner @franksteibli @kahrs Works smoothly in ministries in everyday life
@kahrs Encouraging that apart from &quot;constituency lobbyism&quot; and &quot;anachronism&quot; you probably have no arguments
"Good morning, on the way to Berlin"
"@_LarsPetersen @jonathan_storz If it&#39;s that easy, why is the federal government building and renting in bulk in Berlin? #Faktencheck"
@kahrs @erik_donner At least one can argue about the argument. Cost claim is demonstrably wrong and therefore ridiculous
@kahrs @Team_GLoetzsch #Factscheck: expenditure (!) division of labor € 7.7 million a year. Moving several billion euros. Saving every year without moving
"@jonathan_storz Um, it&#39;s about the office buildings for the employees"
@ArminLaschet we can agree on that! But also criticize your own party friends if it is necessary for Bonn and NRW
@ArminLaschet You should hear your Bonn party friends about your strategy ... And the @kahrs has been unsuccessful since 1999
@kahrs Read the textbook on compound interest calculation on the way :-P
@SteinkeCDU We in Bonn don&#39;t look at the party book. Therefore @kahrs and de Maizière jointly criticized by the Bonn SPD and CDU
@dneuerer We were the first. Already a traditional character :-(
"And good luck with the construction for the 7,000 employees who would then have to move to Berlin http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/bauprojekte-kosten-bundesregierung-1-milliarde-euro-mehr-als-geplant-a- 984158.html…"
@LiterallySimon from 1999 to 2012 there was no such majority
LINKEN-Ernst is again spreading the fable that the minimum wage could have been decided long ago in the Bundestag. #Factscheck Federal Council needed
"Now in the plenary: Ceremony for 100 years of World War I, minimum wage, dual citizenship"
@ArminLaschet You have specified the number of digits to be deleted before (!) The conversation. So either pseudo participation or hot air
@ArminLaschet Summary: Hot air!
"Where exactly does the @ArminLaschet want to cut 15,000 jobs in NRW? Butter with the fish ..."
"My lineup proposal for #GERFRA: Tor Weidenfeller, central defense Hummels and Neuer :-)"
I wrote on FB on minimum wages. Thursday we write social-political history https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=589663521151563&amp;substory_index=0&amp;id=120875131363740…
"@liese_mueller With secured funding, you could also train more educators. Relief for educators through domestic help"
"@liese_mueller The costs in the final stage will be 1-2 billion euros annually. What is missing is where there is too little money today, such as U3 support"
"You also have to learn from mistakes, dear coalition partner. The care allowance damages and steals the money from important investments"
"@emtiu Achso, HörenSagen-Flat rate judgment type"
@emtiu try it for once with research :-(
The additional earnings of Mr. Gauweiler are quite a problem in view of the large number of missing hours and many missed votes

"@ FraPe0101 Already because @drmfuchs invents a problem (900 hours), you have to say it openly"
@drmfuchs So you can answer if you have just been convicted of physics ignorance @erhardrenz
"@drmfuchs You&#39;re still not denying human-made climate change, are you?"
"Sorry, colleague @drmfuchs, but you have mistaken real operating hours and operating hours added to full load hours"
"For the fourth time, NRW tops at abhallwatch.de. Nice news after returning from vacation :-) https://www.abänenwatch.de/blog/zeugnis Noten_2014…"
@campact No response. But implementation of government program and coalition agreement # remain honest
@jdoeschner Such nonsense. Not even a bill. Now six months of public debate
@papapreuss Exceptions only for integration Long-term (!) unemployed and until 18. Everything else only transition until 2016

"@ victor5679 That wasn&#39;t a play on words by me, but by Minister Dobrindt, probably unintentionally :-)"
Dangerous to stand at the lectern as a CDU politician (aka &quot;Black&quot;) and to start the speech with &quot;The black zero stands&quot; :-)

Good Morning. Today in the plenary. In the afternoon then the opening of Pützchen&#39;s market
@ jpoff1 eyewash? On the contrary! Consolidation despite simultaneous relief for the municipalities!
"@GruegerS Exactly so, only highways!"
@GruegerS The @BMWi_Bund has only checked the legal possibility of the toll. It is dubious to support the details
