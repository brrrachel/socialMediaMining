@Chappi_Baxton :-)
@SU_Saar Eat an extra large portion for me! :-) Thank you for your efforts this year: Your work was great!
@SiskoBLN where did you see me there?
@ Brownscharly1 you too. We&#39;ll see you soon!
"@ Brownscharly1 Unfortunately not, I don&#39;t have one available yet. Can neither go to Seppl nor to the Mayor of Lebach, who was a good friend."
@ Brownscharly1 :-)! Merry Christmas!!!
@LandahlPascal I&#39;ve already done it. But without the press!
@ Speech tube I would only have known earlier that you exist! :-)
@norberthense Not only there. Already 1 year ago I wrote in FAZ that the network is the biggest policy change since the French Revolution!
"@FrederikFatz @SU_Saar I&#39;m not sure, but definitely after the party! :-)"
@alexzeyer @SU_Saar Then fight well - and show @leopold_born what a powerful SU state association is!
"Thanks to everyone for questions, discussion, listening in #mumble #DE. It was exciting and fun. Thanks to @ Kyra2001!"
@leopold_born @SU_Saar eaten. That&#39;s how I became what I am! :-)
"@leopold_born @SU_Saar If the SU provides the regional student representative, it must be really good! I also have the portions as a SU / JU student ./2"
Lower Saxony is also top when it comes to the energy transition: the world&#39;s first wooden wind tower is in Hanover! @NdsLandesReg
@NdsLandesReg is also in the energy transition
There is going to be a tap on the wood! Put the first wooden wind tower into operation in Hanover: 100m high
@einfranz @ThomasJoSchmitt the company bikes are clear. But they are there for all employees and not just for the minister! :-)
@einfranz @ThomasJoSchmitt
. @ ThomasJoSchmitt My own bike goes with muscle strength. I have to be careful not to be flashed all the time!
@ Schopi21 @ monokel1 Electricity was traditionally more expensive in Germany - long before the energy transition - because security of supply is much higher. #Blackouts

@orangesolar well
"@BabettesChefin comes from the fact that a faction of democracy, human rights, Europe, Israel has problems and the CDU therefore does not cooperate"
@MrTimsel @schmidtlepp exactly. That is why I am in favor of a clear lower wage limit

@TFrankRBK didn&#39;t even know that there are so many Twitter / friends in Bergisch-Gladbach!

@PeterDresbach Thanks for the Ferdback! Now I&#39;m on my way to Bonn
@KindSchrecklich has nothing to do with admitting but is mathematical logic. Only taxes are increasing progressively. The rest is the same for everyone
@Mad_Pit_Bull :-) just a shame there was no buffet ...

@hkrichel To be honest: Better bad caloric than bad laws!
@andersch_be @schmidtlepp Electricity costs are taken into account in the calculation and hot water is free (KdU)
Texts are all on the table. Everyone checks u compares. Plenary is delayed because country groups advise each other.
"@Schmidtlepp One could, for example, raise the incomes of the low-income considerably. or waive rent, electricity and heating? Right?"
"@Schmidtlepp when Bill Gates wears bespoke suits, he spends less on his income than HartzIV recipients who buy from C&amp;A"
"@Schmidtlepp If you have little income, you always pay more for food, rent, clothing, heating, electricity. Statistically logical."

@ Monokel1 thank you. Hopefully it doesn&#39;t drown :-)
Exciting interview by @petertauber and @larsklingbeil yesterday in WamS on the Internet and Twitter! worth reading
@GabiKostorz That was definitely not meant badly. But of course BMU also makes energy: renewable energy! :-)
@GabiKostorz I think you misunderstood the @philipproesler. We are both for the environment and energy
@salz_zur_sahne The question is whether this game is not slowly outdated. I almost never did it and drove well with it.

@scampy_joe @ Kyra2001 And how. Only 8 days or so
@OttoCarsten :-)
@ Koschda77 Did you suspect that you are trod on the TRittin. :-) Golf clubs have to pay the EEG surcharge just like you. Was a duck
"@Tuenalgan As an Esx minister, you rarely have air-conditioned company cars. &#39;Thank God, never normally."
@matthias Zoom I&#39;ve heard more original answers. :-) We need a concept that integrates highway and rail with energy!
@Geisterfalle And it&#39;s not that far to the beach
@Mic_Ruby It burns to itself. At my expense ...
@ Koschda77 You want the energy transition - don&#39;t you? I make sure that the prices are tamed.
"If we sweat in the shade at 40 degrees in 30 years with our walkers, we will be asked why we didn&#39;t do enough at the time"

@ ranzen01 I&#39;m in the air and on the go! :-)
@steffen_pelz Who says that?
"Many thanks to @CampactPresse for over 110,000 signatures for more climate protection! Back strengthening for Doha!"
@CampactPresse am on the way!
@mettigel_ It&#39;s the other way round: I&#39;m missing half of the party conference because I&#39;m going to Doha this morning! :-)
@mettigel_ I&#39;ll be there tomorrow
@ aotto1968_2 because fewer votes were cast by the assessors. :-)
@AndreasStolze I thought it was a lot less!
"@leopold_born Thank you! After all, I was SU too!"
@alexzeyer Thank you for your support!
@SU_Saar thank you for your congratulations!
"@bund_net clear, I do"
@bund_net I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair: it&#39;s been known for a long time that I will arrive in Doha tomorrow and be part of all the crucial discussions
Angela Merkel made a clear and unequivocal commitment to the energy transition in her speech! As a worldwide export hit!
@DrMakuse Quite your opinion
"@Ballkultur Clear, they are and therefore journalists shouldn&#39;t talk about our officials in front of the camera! :-)"
@mpucher @pv_forum @LongoFL @GruegerS @solarpapst There will be a focus on new plants because they receive a lower feed-in tariff
@pv_forum Yes. For new PV roof systems. Interest and redemption subsidies via KfW
@red_hardliner @christiansoeder Such statements come when you have your TL in view :-)
"@ Soest64 indeed. But the pirates should not forget to take care of the virtual rooms, otherwise they will be boarded!"

@CDUBiblis :-)
@CDUBiblis;
@Soest64 :-)
"@CDUBiblis Yes, you just didn&#39;t register them - now they stand out because they confirm skepticism"
@rmroppert you will see it!
@ira_red you should definitely be off-road. And have fun at work
"@ Soest64 not me either, especially for reasons of time. I find Twitter very exciting"
@Nico was fun. Unfortunately I am still in use and on the way to the next appointment
@rmroppert Did you see the positive reactions from Gabriel u Trittin? We will agree long before the Bundestag election ...
@rmroppert
"@ Soest64 Yes, but they are really the exception on social media!"
@CDUBiblis is best emigrated to the USA - they have a lot of blackouts without any energy transition
@CDUBiblis The best way to emigrate to the USA: they have a lot of power cuts without any energy

"@dieKnothe Well, water, electricity, and food are not free either. But UvdLeyen has achieved that Internet is in the HartzIV sentence"
@markheuer I don&#39;t know any country in the world that can do without growth. But growth must not be at the expense of the environment.
@jimidesaster Thank you! Do you mean the interview or my tweets?
"@andbraeu If we didn&#39;t do that, fewer and fewer people would have to pay ever higher EEG surcharges. It can&#39;t last long #BAMBULE"
@dieKnothe &#39;Funny: No one has ever asked me how long I can go without running water and electricity! Internet is a human right.
"Doha-outcome better than expected by many. But now, EU must push for action. Climate Change Comittee and Environment Council very important"
@Minister_Remmel Of course not. No alibi debates please. Citizens know that the CDU and BMU prevent fracking risks.
"@FullMescher on the contrary, I thought it was great"
"On the contrary, @FullMescher"
Dear @peersteinbrueck: Please tell if you tweet yourself so that we don&#39;t mistake your employees for liability! :-)
@Elektronews Steinbr√ºck has nothing to say. Has already declared that he will not join a CDU government.

"@Valentin_Marcus @BabettesChefin It all depends: If the criticism is witty or original, I think that&#39;s great! :-)"
"@ muenster4life Yes, but only after I have been told what it is. In the past there was also talk of bought followers, for example in the USA"
"@fullmetalfriese But they would not have much of it with me, because what can they sell me? :-)"
@DavidGansel I think so too. Just hope it is not &quot;organized&quot;.
"But also, for example, employees who do not want their supervisor to read what they are writing"
Then it is often the case that people who bully on Twitter act under a false name.
"For me, these are often journalists who don&#39;t want you to &quot;see&quot; them"
"OK, but behind it are usually real people who are interested in a Twitterer but do not want to reveal their identity"
What do you mean by fake?
@purlitz thank you. Sit on packed suitcases in Doha. It is about to go to Berlin!
"Not only Kyoto, but the entire Doha Package adopted with great support from the contracting states. Achieved more than expected for a long time."

On the way to @tsghessen @zafolo @fraeulein_tessa I&#39;m stuck in a traffic jam in Frankfurt: Where is the driveway to the information superhighway?
@GruegerS for what?
"Stefan Wenzel gives the wrong impression: I said that explorations are pending until the election, but not if and when they go on afterwards."
@icrfornax Thank you. I hope that the ice will break from today.

"@gormulus yes, almost always, but sometimes there are exceptions, such as after NSU murders"

"@juliusbrockmann Yes, but we managed to get through despite the concerns"
"@GregorKeuschnig No, but if factions that usually argue about almost everything agree on key issues, that&#39;s a good sign"
"@ Evo2Me Of course not, but if it does come about it is a strong sign!"
@JSchmanck Because the network connection takes much longer than was originally promised. Many wind turbine triodes were already installed
"In the Bundestag today there is a large democratic consensus among the CDU / CSU, SPD, FDP and the Greens. Only the LEFT stands apart. Too bad."

@andbraeu Thank you and good evening!
@dieKnothe Super.Thanks for the Twitterview! It was fun. Now I&#39;m off the field.
@jimidesaster you too! :-)
@andbraeu I share the opinion. But we have to organize the energy transition so that it costs less. Otherwise the citizens mutinate.
"@lonelyjogger impression is not true, because the consumer always had to pay for the networks. I will correct undesirable developments."
@julianbanse Thank you for encouraging #BAMBULE
"@dieKnothe No, still not because I answer tweets like crazy! Have had little shit storms, but they don&#39;t bother me either"
"@Carlo_Reissmann Yes, mistakes have been made in the past and I work hard to prevent this from happening again."

@RheinReporter @ matze0612 That really does something in Germany: that&#39;s why I start the campaign &quot;Bye bye to Stand By&quot;
"@jokerfilm @CaptOrwell No, but you know that: went along, hung up. We need more civil courage!"

"@electroheinz So far, hardly. And it happens with a desire to change something!"
"@CaptOrwell There too. They often don&#39;t have the courage to forego profit for the benefit of the environment, also out of fear of competitors."

"@jubayern Sure, you are definitely good, because JU + CSU Bayern are once again at the forefront when it comes to network policy!"
@TheUnicornXXL How do you get it? See the answer to @ netvault1 before
@ egalis88 @aktivist_in :-)
"@ egalis88 @aktivist_in Why? You can&#39;t mean me, because I was in Brussels for 5 years before and I knew before that."
@ netvault1 The difference is: The United States mostly cheat in deserted areas. Everything is densely populated here. So have to be careful
"@brk_bewild I do not know by heart, but is in the Ministerial Act: Available in this network!"

"@QQuencher However, one has to say that the energy market in D has always been heavily regulated."

@sven_kindler The Greens have something to make amends! :-)
"@ added energy well done vid. All right, but we have to be careful that the EEG surcharge does not go through the roof."
@NAJU_BW Much enthusiasm and success for your work! Thanks for a great discussion!

it won&#39;t take that long. Results earlier and before the election
@IreneMihalic read my procedural proposal for reforming the EEG!
@MGrosseBroemer :-))
@Carlo_Reissmann I already have!
The @JTrittin did not understand that a successful energy transition requires more than ideology and number hacking! We make it!
@LongoFL You should polemize less and integrate more: then the energy transition is on!
@frontmotor why? It is a good thing that photovoltaic supplies when the electricity is needed
@Kola_Colman :-))

@AlexanderRackow thanks for the nice hint: great! :-)
"@UlrichKelber if it happens: rightly so! If not, you will be screaming. So we are quitt!"
"@UlrichKelber I don&#39;t, because that depends on many factors that we don&#39;t know, e.g. B. Exchange electricity price and expansion rate EEG"

@LongoFL @csinss for oil and gas does not exist. Not even for imported coal
"@LongoFL @csinss it&#39;s not quite that simple, because the EEG feed-in tariff comes on top of the renewal in addition to the exchange price."
@ mapro67 two years that everyone had known for a long time that they couldn&#39;t go on like this.
@ mapro67 it hurts my soul for every job that gets lost. But it&#39;s also the result of a huge boom in the last 1/2

@sven_kindler CDU has achieved against SPD that subsidy for coal production in Germany expires. PS: actually we were perdu!
"@piratenschlumpf The markets can do a lot, but not everything. If subsidies are paid for renewables, the state also has to regulate"
@pv_forum Unfortunately only around 11% of the installed panels are from German production.
"@pv_forum With the consent of the solar industry, I have ensured that there is a guarantee of up to 52 GW, so planning security"
"I&#39;ve been saying this for 4 months. If SPD and Greens criticize this, they will weaken the position of the coastal countries."
That is precisely why we need binding agreements between all federal states on quantities and lines.

"@ broadcast :-) No, it&#39;s EesTop"
@henningninneh yes and from the Bundestag. Both had to agree or let it happen
"@Torgator Not at all, the &quot;capping&quot; will only take effect in a few years. Reduction in open space to 10 MW was suddenly that."
@hoechts The expression block party is really wrong
. @ TanteJay Not necessarily. But it is hypocritical if some later pretend they weren&#39;t there.
"The capping of photovoltaics was decided jointly by the SPD, the Greens, the CDU / CSU and the FDP in July. So can&#39;t be that wrong."
"@zuputu is being worked on, is currently only overlaid by other topics"
@UlrichKelber I don&#39;t know because it depends on many factors. But I work to make it as cheap as possible for consumers
"@UlrichKelber SPD / Greens have also decided juicy relief for the industry on electricity taxes. ME rightly, by the way"
Just to clarify: Who started to relieve the industry of the electricity prices was the @JTrittin as environment minister.

@jakob_bl I just did a political test. They say I&#39;m cosmopolitan: that&#39;s right. Then they say I&#39;m social dem .: I don&#39;t know! :-)
@martindelius @peteraltmaier For what else! :-))
"@Ober_Franke It depends: If, for example, you are 15 years old, it pays to buy it quickly. But need models for which they lack the money."
@Ober_Franke Why? I didn&#39;t know until I happened to read it 1 year ago.
@the_necrosis :-)
"@UlrichKelber But the development of the exchange electricity price is uncertain. If it drops further, the difference costs increase!"
"I&#39;m happy about the 25,000 followers! Thanks to everyone who is loyal to me and endures my tweets! :-))"
@UlrichKelber no one knows what the apportionment is in 2014 because it depends on many factors. But I want to work well and then laurel
"No, but @larsklingbeil, iorgendwie! :)"
@DerProVomKlo @ Wettendass But all the time! Because with Markus Lanz I was on the show!
@bueti I&#39;m a bit traumatized from yesterday! But it will be again! :-) And we&#39;ll get the repository together
@icrfornax @B_E_Dahlke :-))
"@KonstantinNotz @dorobaer @fabianhamak A reindeer would be very profitable for the Greens, because they always run after the zeitgeist!"
Great atmosphere at # dtl12. Thanks for reception + debate! JU is unique. I look forward to working together for Germany and Europe!
"@JTrittin: A bill was first requested mid-week. Until then, the rule was: first political agreement, then law"
"Dear @Volker_Beck I still don&#39;t know what the green ones actually want, they only say what they don&#39;t want! #Endlager"
@Minister_Remmel :-)
. @ christiansoeder I am seriously considering retweeting this tweet from @jtretin. He almost deserved it! :-)
@dpomondi consensus is possible. Negotiated with opposition emissaries in June and directly with G / T in July. Then again since September
@aotto1968_2 :)
"The repository should be kept out of the election campaign. In 4 months I didn&#39;t say a bad word about SPD / Greens, but I mediated internally!"
"@tachy_ we are doing a lot of research on that, but at the moment they are still too expensive"
@UlrichKelber A GE was known to @JTrittin u @sigmargabriel since June. in summer and now there were further offers on the structure of the authorities
I don&#39;t understand @JTrittin: Meeting was arranged at the request of MP Kretschmann. @JTrittin had known about it since Tuesday
@janfrenzel the climate is still alive and I am not giving up hope!
"@fullmetalfriese Can still be, if you are really big! :)"
"@salz_zur_sahne @peteraltmaier I actually do all the time. By the way, hermaphrodite made me think!"
"@silkherrmann @peteraltmaier @EddieCaramello Today was both! First Vienna, then Warsaw"
@ Kyra2001 My employee tried to reach you because of equipment for DE on December 22nd. Hope you are in good contact
. @ Kyra2001 I tried to save our climate! Still in Vienna this morning. And Twitter always in your pocket! :-)
". @ EddieCaramello Yes I should, but I&#39;m sitting in a hotel in Warsaw talking to Twitter! :-)"
Twitter can do much more than campaigning! It enables a real dialogue in which thousands of people are involved! @ArminLaschet
@ SocialSecrets1 Better not - otherwise he will send the cavalry!
"Dear @ArminLaschet, I am pleased that you are now one of us and I hope you enjoy using Twitter!"
@janjaapvanhalem Il already looking forward to an exciting debate!
"@jEhoppe Nine, a timetable for the amendment"
"@WahlWahnsinn it was before, otherwise usually only in the evening"
"Talk to my AUT colleague in Vienna today about nuclear stress tests, energy transition, climate protection. Europe is concrete."
"@ WDSCHAEFER67 I am always, but Peer has seriously injured the Twitter community with his public. testify"
@ WowbaggerXX7 @ broadcast how do you know that there will be no results? Discussion has just started!
"@szalowski no idea. But with the high fuel prices, many people leave their car at home and FDJ learn Pedelec"
"@VQuaschning @jtretin No, but only if you drive to work instead of driving an e-bike"
@VQuaschning @jtrittin
"@Schwabenpfeil clearly you speak F! I think that&#39;s great, because I only learned it myself when I was in Brussels with 30 EU officials!"
@Pelzeter @jtretin Exactly: Safety at ALW goes beyond all national borders!
@ aired I said above all in the DLF that it was good that Germany had insisted on stress tests. Otherwise we would not be ready now
@larsklingbeil My SPD colleagues say that more often. But I know I get away much better in their secret dreams! :-)
"@StephanBulicke on longer, hilly routes"
@tmmd @jtretin there will soon be a loading infrastructure. Goes faster than many beliefs.
"Dear @JTrittin, I understood your statement on NPP safety in such a way that we should talk together about EU-wide consequences."
". @ JTrittin We still have to make an effort for electric cars. However, 1 million e-bikes would be great, because many use them to work instead of by car."
"@Tomte_Tummetot Sorry, you are not so inexperienced: he has to build, maintain, cope with failures (or if no electricity is needed)"
"@justeazy You missed the message of the tweet: Whoever tweets does himself a favor, because he knows more about the world! :-)"
@anked Also a blind chicken ... :-))
@mfmotor And for every single Tweet! :-)
@karstenklein Thank you very much! I am happy to follow your Tweets on Twitter and I will certainly meet my new colleagues in DH.
@ Corleone1952 I just do my politics. always been. Let&#39;s see what happens. :-)
. @ christiansoeder That we would both find each other again on Twitter! ... thanks and: &quot;Tweet to&quot;
@kreppo @Minister_Remmel The Union certainly didn&#39;t invent it - but noticed in time! :-)
Sometimes I think I should have tweeted. Then I could pat Peer Steinbr√ºck on the shoulder and say how cool we are.
@Nico :-))
"@ D3rB3obacht3r Well, there are only 16 of us ... :-)"
@johnnynogo :-))
@heinzandreas Diie have not yet reported: Thank God!
"@marchannebrook Yes, I appreciate him for that too, but he&#39;s going a hard way: Because he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing! Still: Chapeau!"
@CamilloGaul :-))
. @ Nico I met you recently at Berlin Hbf! Best regards!
". @ _ kge_ Only sustainable growth is good growth, also for renewables. Networks must be able to vote - locally and nationwide!"
"@Mobileich I like to go everywhere, but the prerequisite is always an invitation from the CDU or environmental institution"
@AlexSchestag I&#39;ll look at the 1996 report
"@MKreutzfeldt Exactly, the &quot;if&quot; illustrates the conditionality!"
@MKreutzfeldt Of course Peter Altmaier didn&#39;t say that. Is not an ideological question but has to be decided on a case by case basis.
@B_E_Dahlke :-))
"@ 7VAMPIR @Minister_Remmel Yes, and that is when it is needed, for example because the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining"
@johnnynogo Could you be wrong? :-)
@ GerhardKoning1 @Minister_Remmel That&#39;s why I&#39;m only talking about 80% renewables by 2050. # Gewiestwieso
"@RaKahleyss @Minister_Remmel Certainly not a solution in itself, but a contribution to the overall concept ..."
@johnnynogo CDU / CSU is the only formation that announced unpopular issues before elections. Eg VAT 2005. No reason for that at the moment
@ D3rB3obacht3r @Minister_Remmel We have enough plans. We just have to reconcile them ... :-)
"Started virtual fuel cell power plant with @Minister_Remmel. This is how the energy transition is: new ideas, networking, intelligent solutions"
. @ michikoenig @saarlandundmehr @sz Don&#39;t worry about Steinbr√ºck not tweeting - he will miss even more chances! :-)
"Oh, I have to give the @Minister_Remmel another one, because of Fra .. the other day. Good conversation in DD today and nice appointment tomorrow."
Now I understand all the tweets on the subject of choosing and networks: automatic word recognition has made &quot;growing&quot; from &quot;growing&quot;!
@martin_im_web You have to watch me closely: You should recognize them by their fruits! :-)
". @ Tobi141986 I&#39;m doing that right now! :-) Set priorities, citizen participation in planning and citizen dividend in the proceeds!"
. @ GYGeorg @_kge_ And whoever leaves out the weakest link cannot close the circle. Where to put the electricity when the networks are missing?
"@HenningLuneburg The principle is ok, but must not be overstated. There should always be replacement money for vertical wind turbines ..."
@AlexSchestag I was not yet a Minster! But I take every criticism seriously and take care!
@B_E_Dahlke There are also social partners who have understood Twitter: e.g. @larsklingbeil @christiansoeder or @karstenlucke
@tauss @puz_le As a reminder: I will only answer @tauss again when he apologizes to @herrurbach for the laboratory rat.
. @ B_E_Dahlke Ozapft is. Twitter has strengths and weaknesses. From he who underestimated it has already lost!
"@robert_schuette Well, honestly, I don&#39;t know: what if you are not only absent on Twitter but also otherwise? :-)"
@BennySocialNet @B_E_Dahlke If you think it will be ok! :-)
