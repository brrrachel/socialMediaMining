&quot;The Greens must not now give the impression that they are primarily concerned with themselves again.&quot; Prof. Heinz Bude at the # BuVoKlausur18
&quot;The Greens were able to negotiate and compromise without giving up their basic positions.&quot; Prof. Heinz Bude at the # BuVoKlausur18
&quot;Greens were successful in the election campaign because they managed to make their core message strong. And that&#39;s climate policy.&quot; Prof. Heinz Bude at the # BuVoKlausur18

&quot;We need to retrofit at the expense of the corporations. Otherwise it is socially unfair.&quot;
&quot;The regret was just a mock regret. Commitment by the corporations does not help us. @ABaerbock on the #Diesels scandal. # PAM18 # Ash Wednesday
&quot;Something is wrong if only large corporations in Europe make a profit. People struggle with it. We struggle with it.&quot; @ABaerbock at the political #Ashermittwoch. # PAM18
&quot;We had set ourselves the goal of not always hitting right away. But in the climate chapter of #GroKo we can only hit it. There&#39;s nothing in it. But the Arctic is melting very bindingly.&quot; @ABaerbock at the political #Ashermittwoch. # PAM18
&quot;Our job is to inspire people who are changing society positively for politics.&quot; @ABaerbock at the political #Ashermittwoch. # PAM18
&quot;Attitude and radicalism is not a contradiction. We see this as an opportunity.&quot; @ABaerbock at the political #Ashermittwoch. # PAM18

&quot;We were ready to face the pain and contradictions Jamaica would have meant. It is this responsibility that defines the Greens.&quot; @RobertHabeck at # PAM18
"&quot;Those who run after right-wing populists do not strengthen democracy, but only the right-wing populists.&quot; @RobertHabeck at # PAM18"
&quot;Home is the place where people take care of their home. They are @Gruene_Bayern.&quot; @RobertHabeck at # PAM18
