#Factscheck Record New Debt Confederation Black and Yellow NRW Black and Yellow Coalition Partner Schmidt-SPD: FDP
"No, really, the stoves are lukewarm on average? :-("
Naturally. I comment on Lindner&#39;s speech live and do #Factscheck. SPD balance sheet @BMJV_Bund is now really impressive
The @c_lindner praises the Estonian tax system. #Factscheck 4.1% budget deficit despite EU subsidy. But FDP was also king of debts in Germany
"The innovative idea from @c_lindner at the end of the speech: a digital ministry. If you don&#39;t know what to do, set up a working group ..."
The SPD and FDP as federal government have decided to limit rent increases in the portfolio
". @ c_lindner &quot;The state does not appear in the digital agenda&quot; #Factscheck Please read at least up to Chapter III (of seven chapters), colleague"
This picture of the fans of @FCBayern is even more impressive pic.twitter.com/S1EnxQUghE

Your own claims as evidence (!) For your claims? Seriously?
"Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses! Seriously, I&#39;m starting to stop taking you seriously! That is not an exchange of arguments"
I recommend the Lord Deputy. FDP state leaders have a minimum of seriousness. You refuse to provide any evidence
Has anyone asked for Portuguese conditions? So you stick to your dubious comparison? Knowingly?
"The claim is wrong, even if one should lower the state share http://media0.faz.net/ppmedia/aktuell/finanzen/4226587653/1.3555088/default/hq/infografik-kostentreiber-fuer.jpg… #Factscheck"

This is how it works in Lisbon http://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/immobilien/wohnpreise-in-portugal-mieten-wie-vor-50-jahren/3858552.html… Comparing that with Germany is a little embarrassing right?
Dishonest! They change the subject every second and never provide evidence of the most adventurous comparisons / claims
Moment. We are still on your last claim. Supporting documents? Numbers?
#Factscheck building permits and investments increase massively. Where did your claim come from? Any evidence?
"Even for a lobbyist, this attempt at comparison is pretty unbearable nonsense. Stay serious"
#Facts check In Lisbon rents must not be increased at all

"@DegenhardtIngo What, you don&#39;t want to do without all traffic projects so that @IHK_Bonn also gets &quot;Südtangente&quot;? :-)"
"Dear @DegenhardtIngo, unfortunately you have to do without all traffic projects in Siegen. @IHK_Bonn wants to spend all money in #Bonn :-)"
"@IHK_Bonn A59 (planning partly finished), A565 (bridge ailing) and A61 not?"
"@ manullo41 A59 (planning partly finished), A565 (bridge ailing) and A61 not?"
@ manullo41 Region agrees: planning committees BN and RSK have decided to fight for upgrading the Rhine bridge. IHK still on the wrong track
@ manullo41 The region has zero chance if it wants 20-25% of all money for NRW. Who should support that? Don&#39;t go into that
@ manullo41 you go zero on my argument
"@ manullo41 Well, I know the opinion. What do you say about my financing argument? From this follows accusation &quot;cloud cuckoo home&quot;"
Not to forget @ manullo41 @IHK_Bonn A61 and B56 bypass. Discrepancy with population share remains. So we don&#39;t find allies
@ manullo41 @IHK_Bonn New building funds A59 + A565 + Rheinbrücke + Südtangente of all funds in NRW = 20-25% of the funds
@IHK_Bonn There is also pressure elsewhere. We will not get 25% of the funds with 1.6% (#Bonn) or 5.5% (incl. RSK) of the NRW population
@IHK_Bonn Reality insists on priority. You have to negotiate with non-Bonners in Berlin about the distribution of fixed amounts of money
@IHK_Bonn All three MPs tell you that Bonn cannot claim 25% of the NRW funds
@JoamsMichael At the latest (!) No longer a tunnel from Holtorf. Partly bridge structure. At least € 700 million. Then no bridge / A565
@ manullo41 @IHK_Bonn And also the A565! So I stand in Berlin on Monday and demand 25% of the NRW funds for #Bonn?
"@ manullo41 @IHK_Bonn At NKV, Rheinbrücke is much higher than Südtangente. Then why not give priority to it? Ideology?"
@IHK_Bonn Your strategy is unworldly. Tell you all (!) Bonn MdB. And why not mention the bridge structure on your map?
"@JoamsMichael plans BVWP only very rough. Yes, longer tunnel probably &quot;calculated&quot;. PRINS at BMVI includes cards"
@JoamsMichael &quot;Troglage&quot; marked for section in which there is a large bridge structure! Just an oversight?

Prohibit @kdshpger moving from the Eifel to Cologne? Honestly? :-)
"@kdshpger You can do all of this if you rule, even if you have to fight for everything CDU / CSU"
@kdshpger Quadrupling (!) Funding new building is to remedy the shortage of housing. Building permits already doubled in 2009
@kdshpger Buyer principle and rent brake should make it difficult to exploit the lack of housing
"@kdshpger Cologne shrank until 10 years ago, and the trend has reversed since then. Solution only through many measures, one alone is not enough"
"@kdshpger In Cologne, the rental price brake applies for half a year. And you are sure that it did nothing?"
