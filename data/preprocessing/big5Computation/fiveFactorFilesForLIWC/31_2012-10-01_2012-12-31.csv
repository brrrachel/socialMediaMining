@DFoest I feel the same - it was also more of a metaphor for being right about yourself that you deny to others.
New Year&#39;s speeches: Angela Merkel - What she would say if she were honest (which is a contradiction in terms). http://www.handelsblatt.com/7553696.html
@DFoest Especially since the apprenticeship minister for the economy is vehemently against the minimum wage - only the others should pay while he is handing out little gifts
From 2013: More net for millions of employees: up to 200 euros. In the year! Goes for rising energy costs. http://www.wiwo.de/7571724.html
@DFoest is probably symptomatic for all of our politicians. Unfortunately ... was no different with red-green in the federal government.
