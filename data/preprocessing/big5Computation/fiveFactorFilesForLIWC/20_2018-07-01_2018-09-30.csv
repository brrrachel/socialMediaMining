"The last Bayern trend saw us at 5%. Okay, it would be a little sensation, but at least a possible one. :) And here are three good reasons to choose us: 1. Nothing annoys # Söder anymore, 2.

"Okay, an entry of @LINKE_Bayern into the Bavarian state parliament would be a little sensation. But a possible one. Surveys see us at 5%. But even if we don&#39;t make it, we don&#39;t have time to hike. We stay active. For example, when people request care. #ltwby"

Patriarchy and capitalism are a nasty complicity. We cannot concentrate on fighting only one of the two systems of rule. We have to overcome both. @katjakipping #LinkeWoche
"We, the left, can offer something better than capitalism and the nation state. @n_srnck #LinkeWoche"
"&quot;You have certainly noticed that we are 5% in the polls in Bavaria. (Cheering) Half of our 3,500 members have joined in the past two years. We need your support. In Bavaria and in Hesse.&quot; A participant from Bavaria. #LinkeWoche"
"As long as capitalism works the way it works, people lose their homes and are forced to leave them. That is why we have to keep saying: It is not refugees that are your problem, but capitalism. @katjakipping #LinkeWoche"
Technological progress is rolling out an old question of the workers&#39; movement again: the struggles for working hours. We need time prosperity for everyone. I am in favor of reducing working hours in all its diversity. @katjakipping #LinkeWoche
"If we want a better future, we first have to make sure we have a future at all. We need to have democratic control over technology. We have to rethink socialism. @n_srnck #LinkeWoche"
"The stupidest things are often done at the highest technical level: economic bubbles, fake news, racism, etc. @AlexDemirovic #LinkeWoche"

"The four points of @katjakipping: 1. Home of the left is the future, 2. Their strategy is that of the connecting party, 3. Merkelism of the middle is part of the problem, not the solution, 4. We want real changes, ie also the change of government. #LinkeWoche"
"Middle Merkelism will not stop rising rents, poverty or rearmament. The management of the status quo will not stop the shift to the right. For us, therefore, it is about a struggle for new majorities. @katjakipping #LinkeWoche pic.twitter.com/pn0Tvm82IM"
"The current shift to the right can be described in three words: #Seehofer, #Chemnitz, #Maassen. @katjakipping #LinkeWoche"
