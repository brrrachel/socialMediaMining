Congratulations to Dietmar Woidke and the Brandenburg SPD! But above all to Brandenburg: The state retains a strong prime minister who stands for an open and social Brandenburg. So it will continue to go up. #EINBrandenburg #ltwBB #Brandenburg election
"A victory for Orb√°n &amp; Co. You prevented Timmermans, who stands for the rule of law. The heads of government negotiate something, the top candidate process is dead. Of the #Leyen we are the weakest minister. That is obviously enough to become head of the commission."
