@PickiHH no with vds;)
@kwetchen i am in the session :)
@ Montikoeln you can still give a reasonable answer
@caechter simple world. one party is against it: cdu - and anchoring popular decisions needs a 2/3 majority.
@StefanDerStefan in 140 characters? depends primarily on how established parties accept the idea of transparency and participation
@caechter oh so. and factions and parliamentarians who try nothing or how? a little black and white right?
@HartmannMdB thanks.
@caechter yes then you really missed something. there have been several legislative initiatives. but not the necessary majority in parliament.
my thoughts on the tariff model of #GEMA: &quot;There must be a balance of interests&quot; http://bit.ly/MG673T

I can&#39;t get @BiJour on ...
@henningtillmann ok
the CDU state government in Lower Saxony can walk across the water. Not.
@ henningtillmann at RBB I was recently called jens. always these complicated first names.
@RegKritiker especially special
"@JohannesFinke no, I remembered wrong // @fraeulein_tessa"
@ralphmakolla party chairs always go out with us on election evening.
@gelsen yes good chancellor!
@ criticism culture have something against gerd?
"@gelsen in 2005, CDU people saw the nrw election as a clear signal for the federal government. but it was also a few years ago."
@ review culture quatschkopp. the gerd was a great chancellor.
@gelsen but only just under a quarter of the voters support their European policy course. says Röttgen. regrettably.
"@gelsen yes, she has to make difficult decisions now;)"
I think it would be funny if the lafontaine is now chairman of the left party. then he was the first and the last chairman.
@gelsen I think Schröder is always in front of the press on election night. But Merkel wants to see how comments are.
@heiko I think it&#39;s blatant that you can do it with the work-life balance.
@gelsen traditional? ie she is always free on Sundays?
@heiko hm. I do not understand that. don&#39;t you discuss each other every day?
has the CDU federal chairwoman angela merkel already commented on the election result? # nrw12
@RKiesewetter with you too;)
what was missing: another big election evening! - and there it is! thanks @HanneloreKraft #spdnrw # nrw12
röttgen - one-strike-out! #nrw12 #spd
very worth reading! @SPDNDS: Stephan Weil&#39;s interview about the pirates can be found here http://www.facebook.com/Stephan.Weil
@BoehningB does that mean quadriga?
"When the CDU was 32% in polls, Röttgen declared the election to vote on Merkel&#39;s politics. let&#39;s see how it works! # nrw12"
final score 3: 0 for the bsc. #derby
the catch song &quot;you can go home!&quot; comes with a derby rather funny #munster
2: 0 for the bsc by penalty #derby #munster
"@pottblog, I think a blatant diss equate BVB and the current federal government. what does @henningtillmann say?"
@pottblog that does the federal government?
Seehofer wants to avoid Merkel? funny federal government! what&#39;s next? playing hide and seek?
@Fison the @nico is only a fan of success

"@ Herrlarbig pointed accusation, pointed answer."
@herrlarbig @g_reichenbach gave a critical to negative speech on the vds at the party conference. otherwise: good colleague!
@herrlarbig never mind. is a free internet. I can also answer;)
@herrlarbig I see it like this
@herrlarbig I&#39;m not in it
@seb_blumenthal thank you! you too!
@herrlarbig exactly
@herrlarbig prefer to provide national freedom as part of the revision at eu level. then no fines + no vds
@tomaschek the usual ...
@herrlarbig nee also says not to hold onto vds and continue. otherwise my name wouldn&#39;t be over there.
"@herrlarbig exactly! Without the revision, nothing can be done here in Germany that is not 6 months #vds."

@bekado_ after today you will definitely think about it
are the danes the new pirates?
@thorstenfaas so is this one-vote majority?
@tibormaxam good. then from now on we will convince your own store. or you dissolve and come to us;)
@tibormaxam I have no problem with that. but according to your own statement you don&#39;t want to rule.
"@tibormaxam content and values are not orga! anyway, it&#39;s a shame that coalitions are excluded. majorities remain unused"
@Nico local elections in Thuringia I think
"Invent @tibormaxam. Furthermore, coalitions are not just about the same political style, but about overlapping content."
"@tibormaxam ey, we are 150 years old and have held up well. Changing SPD takes longer than party on white sheet of paper &quot;new&quot; .."
"@tibormaxam no, I&#39;m socially through and through. would rather be willing to coalition"
