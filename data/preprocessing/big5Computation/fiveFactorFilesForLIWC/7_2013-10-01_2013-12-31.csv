@papapreuss @ronnypohle why no alternative? Members can say yes or no to the result if it is on the table!
@papapreuss @ronnypohle we are the only party that lets members vote on the outcome of the negotiations - more democracy is not possible!
State party conference in Kiel ended. Good mood and constructive debates.
"@papapreuss @ronnypohle moreover, negotiation mandate does not mean automatism. No coalition without policy change + membership approval!"
@papapreuss @ronnypohle has given a negotiation order with 86% party convention! Should we vote on black-green or new elections?
@papapreuss @ronnypohle I do not understand - there is still no negotiation result- + which alternative should be voted?
@papapreuss @ronnypohle is important public discussion about content + that all party members can vote on the outcome of the negotiations
@papapreuss @ronnypohle I thought you might mean private health insurers or something ..... ;-)
The dogs bark and the caravan for fair wages moves on .... ;-) Pardon dogs of course - actually they are howling wolves .... ;-)

Mr. Arp (CDU SH) says that the rent brake that we negotiate with Union harms the tenants. Aha- the man understood the brakes.
@hebesteff if it were all that easy .... ;-)
"Well, if you categorically rule out that those with the highest incomes and wealth have to contribute more, you have to explain!"
It&#39;s amazing how cheeky CDU opposition politicians from SH appear when it comes to traffic policy - instead of being ashamed of failures and glitches.

@spd_stefan @DerBruesseler Find all this depressing and unsuitable for 140 character skirmishes.
@DerBruesseler well for those who can not take prejudices by anything - clich√©s instead of facts - actually a pity - intellectual is more!
@DerBruesseler @SPDSH It&#39;s all nonsense with alleged party affiliations and &quot;THE&quot; politics - rather tragic individual failure.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today only half a day in the office in Kiel and then private. I wish you all a nice day;-)

@danielasgedanke Concluding the whole leadership from a local politician is probably not quite as fair.

@JohnSturges Even the abusive word &quot;good man&quot; in the comment speaks volumes. Poverty = abuse of social benefits? No thanks!
What is to be misunderstood about the sentence &quot;There is no anti-refugee policy with the SPD&quot;? It is a question of attitude! Article 1 GG applies!

&quot;There is no alternative to consistent refugee control for a market-compliant democracy&quot; (Urban Priol) - he must have heard the radio today ..
@ThomasVerheugen Too bad if compassion and basic values are phrases for you - then you really deserve my pity!
"Don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with them: instead of contemplative Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve rest, permanent polemics against minimum wages and refugees."
So dear partners of the CSU until 2017: Anti-refugee policy is neither Christian nor social + with SPD not in it!
Funding aid programs for particularly affected municipalities and programs for social cities and integration is better than stirring up fears!
Anyone who thinks they score points at regular table resentments in local or European elections is wrong. They immediately choose AFD-Original or worse ...
Development cooperation based on the Millennium Development Goals instead of arms export records and access to the labor market instead of social envy debates!
"If anyone believes that there is an anti-refugee policy in the federal government with the SPD, they are wrong. Article 1 of the Basic Law is our yardstick!"
"We should not fight poverty, not the refugees, something must be done about civil war, persecution and poverty as a cause of flight!"
In government with the SPD it will be nothing !! ‚Äú@ N24_de: New rules from 2014 - CSU announces the fight against poor migrants # N24 #News http://l.n24.de/18PLYsi‚Äù

I am pleased that the party executive unanimously voted me as a deputy. Has nominated party chairmen. I want to take care that the SPD profile is sharpened!

Great backing for our government and parliamentary group members to implement and enforce our points in the Koa contract.

@b_riexinger @SoenkeRix maybe you should talk to unions about it - then you might think of more than anti-SPD slogans.
What a whisked curd cheese! ‚Äú@B_riexinger: If the SPD would fight for the minimum wage in 2014 as it did for the Ministry of Finance.‚Äù
@manomama I wish you a nice day ;-)

"However, I find the constitutional concerns of so-called experts against SPD member votes quoted by Marietta Slomka completely absurd!"
I mostly like the hard-working journalism of Marietta Slomka. Yesterday Sigmar Gabriel was very good in the lively interview.
Hurry --- Hurry --- Hurry --- Heil and Pronold are coming out to the public to smoke again ... ;-)
@uniwave @ZDF @MartinMeuthen @udostiehl I have to go out as a Slomka fan in general - Sigmar Gabriel gave her a good deal in the interview!
Another musical tip from Rio Reiser is also recommended: &quot;Let&#39;s do it&quot;.

@ Globetrotter128 Just keep dreaming! There is only one direction from the summit: down!
"@ Globetrotter128 I thought black and yellow was voted out, FDP out, CDU strong but without a majority. No change of policy, no chancellor!"
Read with a shake of the head that it is undemocratic when members decide whether the SPD is part of a coalition. Dare more democracy!
Members of the SPD will only agree to a coalition agreement with the Union if the criteria of the party convention for policy changes are met.
"Later at the SPD regional association, preparation of regional conferences next week on the subject of coalition agreement and member vote."
The executive board of the SPD parliamentary group is now meeting in the Kiel State House.
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Office appointments in Kiel, then back to Berlin, where the final of the coalition negotiations is approaching. Wish you a good week!"

Excellent! 2: 1 haze. Only the HSV!!!!!!
1: 1 Badelj finally. Only the HSV!!!!
@ArminLaschet that is really completely away from me - you will still have a lot of fun with it ;-)
"@DerBruesseler I am far from this opinion, see my quote from KN front page of today."
Why do I have the feeling that the connection between differentiated judgment and plain text is so rare in politics and among its critics?
@DerBruesseler maybe because your clich√©d understanding of politics does not apply to the Hessian SPD? Thinking sometimes helps!
Right Hesse Union and agile Greens can now show what comes out of this connection for the people of Hesse - I&#39;m excited!
"@DerBruesseler keep your cynicism if it gives you something, for others it is rather boring!"
Celebrating Willy Brandt&#39;s 100th birthday in L√ºbeck made it inspiringly clear that it is something special to be a social democrat!
The mixture of the colors green and black produces a less attractive result.

Farewell to Hans Wiesen at funeral service in Bordesholm.
CDU colleague Bernstein speaks of the state government&#39;s &quot;stubborn&quot; answer. Today&#39;s conservatives are no longer what they never were.
"@ulfposh well, sometimes not so sensitive-picture really elegant and rather harmless; by the way: you are very generous when it comes to serving!"
"Ulf Poschardt again in the face dog for SPD haters, as if Union had a majority in the Bundestag without a change of policy - but it didn&#39;t!"
The state parliament goes back to Berlin in the afternoon.

"In the #ZDFmoma, Dunja Hayali wanted to promote me twice - what an omen for that day ;-) Now I&#39;m off to Berlin!"
In Schwerin on the way to the ZDF studio. Interview at #ZDFmoma at 7.35.
@RASimoneWeber these are the real problems ;-)
Like right now? Did you know what you didn&#39;t understand? Bingo - it&#39;s about lightning and thunder!
Who is Janina? Now that&#39;s the weather fairy here on the radio ... just because you ask ... should be a very nice day - whether it is thunderstorm in Berlin?
@_Mrs_Heart nice day ;-)
@Alpenwilli I am pleased that you are already so friendly and in such a good mood in the early morning ;-) hope dies last!
@ManuelaSchwesig I&#39;ll be with you in Schwerin in the studio for interview #ZDFmoma - see us later at coalition negotiations in Berlin ;-)

"Media opinion is strange: in the election campaign it says that programs + parties are the same, then criticism because we choose to stick to our content!"
@Mensch_muelli @DoroBaer doesn&#39;t have to know everything ;-)
@DoroBaer what is not can still be ... ;-) üòÖ
"@_Mrs_Heart the present is certainly at least as moving, right?"
@jensspahn the SPD doesn&#39;t do that at all but we are not the FDP - because of a few posts we don&#39;t sacrifice credibility!
@_drsarkozy @turbozopf is running ;-)
@_Mrs_Heart wow-we have a lot in common ;-)
@_Mrs_Heart is not much missing and I become a fan ;-) üòÄüòäüòÑ
"@_Mrs_Heart would be worth a try, right? üòÄ"
@janfleischhauer only Willy later recognized this as an error and regretted- That&#39;s the difference!
@janfleischhauer sounds a little wacky .... playing with the grubby kids seems to me to be more timeless ;-)
@_Mrs_Heart how cool is that ;-)
"@oezoguz spirited - but there were also Wencke Myrre, a comedian and a Finnish pop star."
@janfleischhauer Politics simply looks different from the privileged perspective than from below. Penthouse vs. Ground floor - you can tell!
@janfleischhauer something comes from something ;-)
"Coming from recording the round with Markus Lanz, which will be broadcast on ZDF this evening at 11:45 p.m."
@RasmusAndresen am I wrong or were there serious black-green soundings and then cancellation ?!
Reading @RasmusAndresen usually helps further - better than cultivating prejudices and clich√©s ;-)
@BKWilster one is almost never &quot;sent&quot;
"@BKWilster Interviews with newspapers, news agencies and a TV appointment on the topics of coalition negotiations + the SPD federal party conference."
@StatusSymptom you can .... ;-)
"And secondly, with their somewhat limited horizon, some only create corns intellectually anyway ..... ;-)"
"I have never found the political picture of eye level convincing - firstly, discriminates against smaller people ......"
"@ boldt24 spoke of head and heart, not of the buttocks - the sitting policy from there was rather the specialty of Mr. Kohl."
"If the SPD is heavily criticized from the right and from the left, then the People&#39;s Party SPD apparently does a lot right programmatically today!"
Some discussions clearly reinforce the basic political orientation: the mind is on the left - the heart beats in healthy people too!
@cgockeln 100% true!
"@ThomasWalde Rather realistic, as far as the Union&#39;s stance is concerned - I&#39;m curious whether Union will then accept the alternative financing mentioned!"
ARD Press Club clearly shows why SPD can only go into government if the policy changes. Without order on the job market + good work no SPD!
"After all, 2 journalists in the ARD press club know what good work is, which deserves the name - precarious employment is exploitation!"
"In the ARD press club, the commentators of the political right show their view of the world: people are good for business - not the other way around!"
@ kami59282 nice Sunday also analog and digital ;-)
@ ge12345ge @ThomasWalde in my interview is the opposite - but prejudices and clich√©s are affected by facts
@ThomasWalde it says in the text of my interview in FAS that taxes for SPD are also about justice and unfortunately block the Union.
@LarsWinter It never rains in Southern California....aber in Ostholstein;-)
