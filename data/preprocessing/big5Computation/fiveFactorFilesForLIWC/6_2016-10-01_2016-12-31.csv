crucial question. right. that&#39;s why I brought the idea of an independent committee with journalists into play ...

what is not possible and that there is actually no problem ... then the domestic politicians do it;)
"yes, but the processes don&#39;t work. you can find my ideas wrong, but I only hear from the lobby .. (1/2)"
"1. Some things are clearly identifiable as a crime (K√ºnast), 2. dominating the market, not small 3. dishes."
"ah sorry, misunderstood."
"clear contact point, 24/7 accessibility, cooperation with investigative authorities. Where is the problem?"
there is no &quot;censorship&quot; attempt by the SPD.
that must come from your party. Nobody from the SPD demands censorship. There won&#39;t be either.
but applies everywhere
yes very correct suggestion!
means freedom of expression. Thank goodness there already is.
That&#39;s not the point.
first of all it is about 24/7 availability at FB and cooperation with investigative authorities. That has to be clearly regulated now.
"where should the judges play? in the case of obvious lies, such as k√ºnast, it cannot take more than 3 days!"
@Bitkom sees a reporting center for criminally relevant content on Facebook as a &quot;censorship monster&quot; ... Without words.
it is not clear to me what the spd has to do with the chaos party congress of essen. but inform them about the real gates ...
