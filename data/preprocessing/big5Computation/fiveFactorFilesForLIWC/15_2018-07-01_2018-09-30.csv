so that it stays that way.
. @ Markus_Soeder: Anyone who still calls this freedom of choice a herd premium misses any respect for parents. #Family allowance #jazuBayern
. @ Markus_Soeder: No country answered organizational and human challenges as well as we did. #Thanks to all volunteers. #JAzuBayern
. @ Markus_Soeder: We live mercy - especially when dealing with refugees: We have spent almost 9 billion euros on the area of asylum + integration since 2015. #jazuBayern
". @ Markus_Soeder: We need a modern system of public transport, individual and bicycle traffic. That is why we want to make local transport cheaper and more attractive. #jazuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: Unlike others, we don&#39;t want to hang crosses in Bavaria! The cross is primarily a religious symbol, but also one of our overall Bavarian identities. Bavaria is a Christian country. #JAzuBayern"
. @ Markus_Soeder: The # diesel drivers and taxpayers are not allowed to pay for the mistakes of others. That will not do! #JAzuBayern
. @ Markus_Soeder: Offers and no bans also in climate protection. Driving bans are the wrong way! #jazuBayern
". @ Markus_Soeder: We should not attack our farmers, but be thankful, because they are Bavaria&#39;s natural and home carers. #JAzuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria should become more decentralized. We do not need a centralized Bavaria, but more opportunities and more responsibility in the regions! #jazuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: This year alone we are investing 20 billion euros in education, science and research. While others only dream of it, we make the future! #JAzuBayern"
. @ Markus_Soeder: That has always been Bavaria&#39;s greatest strength: Always looking a step ahead into the future. #jazuBayern
We need innovations instead of sparing the landscape with wind turbines. #BRDuell # 10H #JAzuBayern
". @ Markus_Soeder: We don&#39;t make bans, we make offers. If you need care, you get it. But with the family allowance we also give you the opportunity to educate yourself at home for a while. #jazuBayern"
. @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria goes its own way in nursing. We support families who stand with love and respect for each other with 1000 € #Landespflegegeld. #JAzuBayern
". @ Markus_Soeder: While other governments paralyze each other, we make the future! We do not want conditions in Berlin, but Bavaria to remain stable. #jazuBayern"
. @ NataschaKohnen speaks of a lack of moral maturity…. Maybe she should rather practice decency instead of just posting it.
. @ Markus_Soeder: I will do everything to keep Bavaria stable. Konrad Adenauer once said: No experiments. I say: No gimmicks with the most successful democracy in Germany. Let&#39;s do everything we can to keep Bavaria stable! #JAzuBAyern
". @ Markus_Soeder: Let us all continue to work to ensure that Bavaria remains strong and stable. Stability is the prerequisite for prosperity and success. Stability holds a country together, stability creates calm and is the best remedy for extremism. #jazuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: For us it is clear: We want a stable, strong and modern democracy and no left or right extremists in the state parliament. #JAzuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: People do not want back and forth, no back and forth, but a clear policy that says what it thinks and does what it says: We achieved more in 6 months than other governments in one whole decade. #JAzuBayern"
. @ Markus_Soeder: Bavaria has always been a country of stability. Bavaria was always unique and a model case. Bavaria is admired and valued. It should stay that way. #JAzuBayern
. @ Markus_Soeder: I want Bavaria to remain the most modern and exemplary democracy in Germany. #jazuBayern #Teilhabe #Teamszeit
@Markus_Soeder: I want Bavaria to remain the most modern and exemplary democracy in Germany. #jazuBayern #Teilhabe #Teamszeit
". @ Markus_Soeder We are Bavaria, we are German, but we are also European. We want a strong and peaceful Europe. We want a Europe of strong regions. This requires more regional participation rights in European politics. #JAzuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: We are setting an example against an increasingly widespread prohibition culture: speed limits, driving bans, meat bans, advertising bans or gender bans - this is not a free state, but a prohibition state. #JAzuBayern"
Bavaria is investing heavily in education. #jazubayern #BRDuell #TVDuell pic.twitter.com/KGvw32zu0m
. @ Markus_Soeder: We stand by our #Police! The new # PAG was an important step in backing up the police officers. Violence against police officers is increasing across Germany. We cannot leave our officials alone. #JAzuBayern
". @ Markus_Soeder: In terms of security, we are for a strong state, but when it comes to volunteering, handicrafts, medium-sized businesses and agriculture, we need less state. #JAzuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: People&#39;s parties are more urgently needed than ever. Not ego first, but the common good itself. Therefore #jazuBayern and JA for #CSU!"
. @ Markus_Soeder: We want to shape a new concept of home: be modern and Bavarian! #JAzuBayern
Bavaria is a country of education: we offer young people the best opportunities. #jazuBayern
. @ Markus_Soeder: Our compass is: The right ones stay and the right ones go. We show the right balance between humanity and order. #Asylum #jazuBayern
"Clear words from @Markus_Soeder to #AfD: Anyone who misuses the White Rose as a symbol is acting shabbily and indecently. We must not ignore that, we must face it and fight it. #JAzuBayern"
". @ Markus_Soeder: With all due respect, I have absolutely no understanding of how to demonstrate against the deportation of criminals. #jazuBayern"
". @ Markus _Soeder: Bavaria is the safest country. #Chemnitz would not have happened in Bavaria, the G20 chaos in Hamburg would not have happened in Bavaria, New Years Eve in Cologne would not have happened in Bavaria. The CSU stands for internal security like no other. #JAzuBayern"
"Bavaria is successful, Bavaria is a way of life. Bavaria is a model country and blueprint for others. #jazuBayern"
. @ Markus_Soeder: Others are federal states. We are Free State. We are proud of that. #JAzuBayern
Strong performance yesterday at #BRDuell! Today we continue with a government statement. The livestream is available here: https://www.bayern.landtag.de/aktuelles/sitzungen/web-tv/… #JAzuBayern https://twitter.com/Markus_Soeder/status/1045058757204594689…

"The TV duel tonight made one more thing clear: @Markus_Soeder is the best prime minister for Bavaria. If you want Bavaria to remain stable, you have to choose CSU. #JAzuBayern #BRDuell pic.twitter.com/SCCg91kpma"
Bavaria is No. 1 organic country! #JazuBayern #BRDuell pic.twitter.com/TQjnj8La5W
@LudwigHartmann are you aware of a case in which the #PAG would have led to excessive hardship? #BRDuell #TVDuell # BR24election
Bavaria is the number 1 security country. Criminal offenses are consistently pursued and investigated! #jazubayern #BRDuell pic.twitter.com/WkdPEbA9M0
"We are very much in favor of advancing the energy transition, but not in a green ban culture. #BRDuell #JAzuBayern #TVDuell"

"We do not allow our police in Bavaria to fall short of the possibilities of criminals, felons and terrorists. #BRDuell #JAzuBayern pic.twitter.com/vh9jEUYkj0"
"Bavaria is running a real quality offensive for childcare: 30,000 new places by 2020 and longer opening hours ensure a significantly better offer. #JAzuBayern #BRDuell"
"Dear @LudwigHartmann, we rely on the freedom of choice of parents for the whole day. That is why around 80% of general education schools offer full-time schools in the current school year. #jazuBayern #BRDuell"
"If you want # freedom of choice, if you want to help parents and don&#39;t want to teach them, you have to say YES to # family allowance! #BRDuell #JAzuBayern"
"Bavaria is the No. 1 family country. No other federal state supports families better. In 2017 and 2018 alone, Bavaria is spending around EUR 5 billion on family policy benefits. #jazubayern #BRDuell"
The Bavarian Asylum Plan ensures clear order and control. #jazuBayern #BRDuell pic.twitter.com/Qqt5NzW0gB
"@Markus_Soeder&#39;s position is clear: give those who have integrated perfectly a chance, but those who commit criminal offenses in our country must be deported! #BRDuell #jazuBayern"
We stand for the separation between asylum and labor migration. It makes a difference whether someone comes to the country as a protection seeker or as a specialist. #BRDuell # br24wahl #TVDuell
"The Bavarian Border Police are very well staffed and well equipped. Bavaria will double the #Grenzpolizei to 1,000 by 2023. #BRDuell #JAzuBayern #TVDuell"
"The # border police is a success: the routes to Bavaria have become less interesting. In the first half of the year we only had 11,000 immigrants in Bavaria, and 8,000 left the country at the same time. The right ones go, the right ones stay. #BRDuell #jazuBayern"
"If you love Bavaria the way it is, if you want Bavaria to stay in Bavaria, you have to choose CSU. We want Bavaria to remain stable! #BRDuell #jazuBayern"
"We are clearly committed to the preservation of creation. With around EUR 190 million a year, Bavaria is investing more in climate protection than any other federal state. #BRDuell #jazuBayern"
Only 12% of the area of Bavaria is settlement and traffic areas. This is the lowest value of all West German federal states. #BRDuell #jazuBayern
We protect our landscape with incentives instead of bans! Bavaria is introducing an unsealing premium. Every square meter that is permanently unsealed is funded. This leads to permeability for water and plants and to more biodiversity. #BRDuell

"We want to support families in creating home ownership.

"We have founded our own state-owned housing association &quot;BayernHeim&quot;. We want to create living space for low and medium income groups such as educators and carers. 10,000 apartments are to be built by 2025. #BRDuell #JazuBayern"
