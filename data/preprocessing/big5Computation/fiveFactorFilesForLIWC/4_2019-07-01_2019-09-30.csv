Our goal: Comply with climate goals with healthy forests - because healthy mixed forests bind CO2. We also want more global cooperation here to conserve and reforest forests worldwide. We want to discuss this in the #Klimadialog: https://www.klimadialog.cdu.de/artikel/koennen-neue-waelder-das-klima-retten…
#Climate dialogue is when you discuss how to replant 900 million hectares of forest. Because the new forest could swallow 2/3 of man-made CO2 emissions. The special thing about it: Exactly the same amount of space is available worldwide - without the need for fields or settlements. pic.twitter.com/2x1jxa9ZPL
... and also done a lot. Our goal: We will achieve the climate goals for 2030 and beyond. More at http://www.cdu.de/klimadialog
"We already have enough levies, duties and taxes in the energy sector. What we still need: more efficiency, more innovation, more control. That is why we are now dealing in a special way with climate protection - we have done this over and over again for many years ..."
#Climate dialogue: We openly discuss how we can achieve our climate goals - even if we don&#39;t succeed in 2020. CO2 is about getting a market-based instrument with real steering effect for climate protection. https://youtu.be/lsjZLHbevW0 pic.twitter.com/uCJKYFwFs6

"But e-mobility alone will not be enough. For us, the #Climate Dialogue is about an overall concept for climate protection. The goal is a nat. Climate consensus across borders of parties &amp; social groups. We are working on it! http://www.cdu.de/klimadialog"
"... if 5 million Norwegians drive more electric cars than 82 million Germans. But: With us, too, the trend in e-mobility is finally pointing upwards. It&#39;s a good thing that the BReg has decided to give the funding a new boost."
We got a lot of feedback on our # Norway comparison. The shortening went wrong. We presented it in more detail here: https://www.klimadialog.cdu.de/artikel/deutschland-ueberholt-norwegen-ist-das-eine-nmeldung… We want to show that there is still a lot to do ...

"Sorry, we are not deleting. But we use the summer to have #climate dialogue (first with our # CDU members). In this way, we want to develop suggestions for compliance with the climate targets. Goal: nat. Climate consensus across the borders of parties and social groups."
