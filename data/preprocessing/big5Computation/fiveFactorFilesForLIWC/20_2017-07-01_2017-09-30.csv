Election campaigns also cost money. Who wants to support us financially: 10 euros for 10 percent https://www.die-linke.de/mitmachen/10fuer10/?10fuer10… #LustaufLINKS
&quot;We rely on donations from citizens. We will transfer donations from corporations back.&quot; @MatthiasHoehn #LustaufLINKS
&quot;We will put issues at the center of our campaign that concern people in everyday life.&quot; @MatthiasHoehn #LustaufLINKS

&quot;You should blow off the next summit today!&quot; @ B_riexinger to the # G20 summit pic.twitter.com/f6yb1aQ9ue
"76,000 demonstrated peacefully and colorfully. @jan_vanaken this morning at @ardmoma on # G20. http://www.daserste.de/information/politik-weltgeschehen/morgenmagazin/videos/jan-van-aken-104.html…"
. @ katjakipping rightly criticized police action against the camps on Wednesday. DIE LINKE rejects violence. @b_riexinger # G20
It would have been good for the Federal Government to make human rights violations in # Turkey a topic at the # G20 summit. @b_riexinger
"To put it bluntly, whoever lights cars and wields violence has nothing to do with leftist protest. @b_riexinger # G20"
"There were massive restrictions on fundamental democratic rights. Nevertheless, 80,000 people demonstrated colorfully and creatively. # G20 @b_riexinger"
# G20 There was a tremendous effort for nothing. Summit format is outdated and undemocratic. UN conference would be needed. @b_riexinger
Press conference with the chairman @b_riexinger. Topics including # G20 and # Turkey https://www.pscp.tv/w/bDIEDzFZTEtKTlhwT292S058MVprSnp5WlBtYUxHdhQ0M-XFky16hnpv5X3AczmkSZFwNxBexa317jNhY8oK…

"Literally @DietmarBartsch said: &quot;Many police officers did a great job, others contributed to the escalation.&quot; # NoG20 # G20"
We want to ensure that nobody in Germany has to work for starvation wages. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB
"We want to relieve everyone up to 7,100 euros gross per month. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
We have an extensive tax concept and want to redistribute taxes. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB
"We need more public housing, social housing. We do that in Berlin. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
"We want to become a third force again, fight for a strong left for a change of policy. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
"Millions were burned at # G20, money would be better spent on starving children in Africa. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
"The legitimate body is UN, not # G20 @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
"One child starves to death every 15 seconds. # G20 summit, however, has nothing to show. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
Hamburg for # G20 was a wrong decision. Everything has to be worked up. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB
on the left stands for justice and solidarity @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB
"# g20 Any violence must be rejected, this has nothing to do with the left, but also has nothing to do with it. @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB"
Police did not act properly. # G20 @DietmarBartsch #sommerinterview @ARD_BaB
"Absurd. @kahrs is obviously lying. Of course, we condemn the violent riots in Hamburg. # G20 # NoG20"
"# G20: Sobering results, violence must be strongly condemned, 80,000 encourage. @katjakipping https://www.facebook.com/KatjaKipping/posts/1576909019007752… # NoG20"
@CDU + @CSU&#39;s election program is a document of cowardice and bad checks. @katjakipping # BTW17 # government program #Merkel pic.twitter.com/Pjn7zD3wZo
&quot;The behavior of @Die_Gruenen in Hamburg is particularly disappointing. They fail as a civil rights party.&quot; @katjakipping # G20Protestwelle
&quot;The Union is banking on armament. The program of #CDU and #CSU shows: 12 years of Merkel are enough.&quot; @katjakipping
&quot;#CDU and #CSU only offer partneristic prophecy. They say nothing about poverty in old age and about financing.&quot; @katjakipping

Support us. With us there will be no reduction in social benefits. We say no to war. @DietmarBartsch # btw17 #linke
We want to restore balance. We want solidarity and not that the elbow is the most important part of the body. @DietmarBartsch
Why aren&#39;t all soldiers withdrawn from Turkey? Why are weapons still being delivered to Turkey? @DietmarBartsch # btw17 #linke
"After 12 years of Merkel, Europe is in worse shape than before. @DietmarBartsch # btw17"
We no longer need armaments expenditure and no more German soldiers abroad. @DietmarBartsch # btw17 #linke
It is a great scandal in this rich country that two million children are poor or at risk. @DietmarBartsch # btw17 #linke

36 billionaires own half of the wealth in Germany. Such wealth can only be created with exploitation. @DietmarBartsch # BTW17
It&#39;s about every voice. We want to remain third force. The right-wing extremists must not become that. @DietmarBartsch # btw17 #linke

"We are the only party that is not lubricated by the economy. We are not for sale, but selectable. @SWagenknecht # btw17 #linke"
"If you want a good pension and good care, you also have to have the courage to get the money from the millionaires. Only we have it. @SWagenknecht"
Do the SPD and Greens really believe that people have forgotten that they have implemented the cut in pensions? @SWagenknecht # btw17
A minimum wage of € 8.84 is not respectful. We have to raise it to € 12. @SWagenknecht # btw17 #linke
How should a change of mood arise if you have to look for differences between the Union and the SPD with a magnifying glass? @SWagenknecht # btw17
Almost 40% of people today have less income than in the mid-1990s. It&#39;s a scandal. @SWagenknecht # btw17 #linke
