In the state parliament there was a debate initiated by us on hate + lies on the net: https://youtu.be/HDvm7l4vFoQ http://www.cdu-fraktion-rlp.de/positionen/reden/17wahliode/‚Ä¶
"Dear @dunjahayali, neither the language nor the content of the attacks o degrading you or your colleague are CDU opinion o my position"
"A great Christian Democrat, intellectual, fighter for equality: Congratulations on the 80th + God&#39;s blessing, Rita S√ºssmuth!"
Minister had asked the Court of Auditors to confirm his legal opinion on the # Mittelrheinbr√ºcke. Court of Auditors: no confirmation possible
"It is conspicuous that the minister never quotes the opinion of the Court of Auditors # Mittelrheinbr√ºcke, since he specifically commissioned it"
"If the government has an interest in it, it should not change its reasoning every day. The minister lacks the money, which is why https://twitter.com/rz_brueck/status/832200311284629504‚Ä¶"
"@HansJosefBracht gets to the point: &quot;Minister, you change your reasoning like your shirts.&quot; # Middle Rhine Bridge"
It is hard to imagine how often the LReg would have cited the Court of Auditors if it had confirmed their opinion. But not so # Mittelrheinbr√ºcke
# Mittelrheinbr√ºcke Mr. K√∂bler said: Planned is not built. Well. FDP and Greens are looking for how they can get out of the divided situation
"FDP has promised in the election campaign # Mittelrheinbr√ºcke, because it has no money # state budget for it, it is looking for a way out, pushes it to the community"
A very important aspect! # Mittelrheinbr√ºcke https://twitter.com/derlachmann/status/832181529744928768‚Ä¶
Let&#39;s form a broad alliance against hate and lies on the net
We parties should commit to not using non-transparent methods such as social bots + clearly differentiate ourselves from them
"Young people have to learn to recognize agitation and lies and to turn against them, not to believe them and to spread them."
The Federal Returning Officer has warned that fake news and hacker attacks can affect the 2017 federal election.
Inhibitions break away in the vastness and speed of the digital data and news flow. Truth loses value.
"The Internet is a medium with many advantages: it connects, overcomes boundaries, makes everyday life easier, and it also entices."
Peter&#39;s policy; fatal. But to wish her violence on the neck: tasteless. That those who otherwise get upset find this good: bad https://twitter.com/hugomuellervogg/status/831466408303263744‚Ä¶
