Gabriel: &quot;Nothing is free on the Internet. At least we pay with our data.&quot; #wirtschaftfuermorgen #digitalleben
Gabriel: &quot;The central condition is the digital self-determination of people.&quot; #wirtschaftfuermorgen #digitalleben
Gabriel: Must also address risks. #wirtschaftfuermorgen #digitalleben
Gabriel: Need a new entrepreneurial spirit in times of digital economy. #wirtschaftfuermorgen #digitalleben
Gabriel: Need more start-up engagement by DAX companies in startups. #wirtschaftfuermorgen #digitalleben

"&quot;With the SPD, there will be no restriction on industrial action in Germany!&quot; Fahimi at #hartaberfair"
&quot;The high acceptance of strikes must not be damaged by quarrels between unions.&quot; Fahimi at #Plasberg
&quot;GDL resigns the obligation to peace. There should be no restriction of the right to strike.&quot; Fahimi at #Plasberg
Gabriel: &quot;The arms export policy is a topic of security policy and knows no industrial policy interests.&quot;
@Spdbt invited to the economic reception under the motto &quot;Industry 4.0&quot;. How was it? Read for yourself &gt;&gt; http://www.spdfraktion.de/themen/machen-wir-deutschland-fit-für-die-industrie-40… #digitalLeben
Gabriel: “We can trust ourselves to have an enlightened relationship with our security interests and others. develop military capabilities. &quot;
Need open debate on arms policy. Gabriel: &quot;We must not pretend that this is a dirty topic.&quot;
Gabriel: &quot;German defense industry must use the civil security markets more.&quot;
Gabriel: &quot;We need increased efforts to bring export practices closer to third countries.&quot;
"Gabriel: &quot;Greater European cooperation, pooling of technological skills and better division of labor are necessary.&quot;"
Gabriel: &quot;This emergency aid is completely different from exporting armaments with a purely commercial interest!&quot;
Gabriel: Deliveries to the Kurds in northern Iraq to defend against IS are neither breaking the taboo nor contradicting our values and legal rules.
Gabriel: Offensive sale of German weapon technology is in force. Law is not compatible and does not serve security interests.
Because German export guidelines must not be relaxed in favor of the partner country.
Gabriel. &quot;We need a Europeanized arms export debate.&quot;
"28 member states with their own army, own navy, own air force is a waste of resources with scarce public. Means."
"Gabriel: &quot;A central task of European politics will be the development of a common foreign, security and defense policy.&quot;"
Gabriel: &quot;The lax arms export policy of recent years was a mistake.&quot;
Therefore: delivery of main battle tanks to the Arab region cannot be justified.
Gabriel: &quot;The basis must be a differentiated foreign and security policy analysis.&quot;
"A reform worth considering: In the future, decisions about arms exports should be made by @AuswaertigesAmt, says Gabriel."
Gabriel: “That is why the coalition has decided to make decisions about arms exports more transparent.”
"The same applies to arms export policy: As Democrats, you must never shy away from the efforts to justify that a public debate requires."
Gabriel made it very clear: Decisions on arms exports must not be made on the basis of daily politics.
Gabriel: &quot;The current coalition has explicitly committed itself to the fact that employment policy reasons must not be a decisive factor.&quot;
Gabriel: “The principle is: no approval. The exception to this is linked to special foreign and security policy interests. &quot;
Now in the livestream at @phoenix_de: Gabriel on the principles of a German arms export policy &gt;&gt; http://www.phoenix.de/livestream/
In 15 minutes on @phoenix_de: Sigmar Gabriel gives a keynote speech on the German arms export policy at the DGAP.

&quot;Right-wing extremism is not an East German problem. It exists in the center of society. And it has to be fought from the middle.&quot;
&quot;It was the courage of the founders that contributed to the fact that more and more people subsequently took to the streets. # 25yearsSDP
