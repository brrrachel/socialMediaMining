It does not make it better if the JuLis falsify our position through such references ... Were the borders closed before summer 2015? Wasn&#39;t there a Schengen? No. We only want to temporarily go back to the Dublin rules as long as there is no EU asylum policy. CL
"@Fdpbt unanimously passed a resolution on Friday, which once again marks our position that has been taken since 2015. Where are the centrifugal forces? Some find it difficult to realize that we temporarily share the CSU position on rejection up to the EU solution. CL"

That&#39;s nonsense. We have been in this position since 2015. Out of reason and conviction. This is only about the sober comparison of a single position with the valued competitors. Reflex custody. CL

&quot;I didn&#39;t see it when I went in: Where is the #kreuz?&quot; 😂 CL is currently speaking at the TU # Munich. TL pic.twitter.com/Sxq0JZS86C
I think I still used the word &quot;secular&quot; with the citizens ...
"Congratulations to @ria_schroeder. Looking forward to a new, feminine face - and to your and your ideas! :) CL # buko56"
The @KonstantinKuhle says goodbye to the office of Federal Chairman of @jungeliberale today. Thank you for the good cooperation in four decisive years of @fdp! CL # buko56
"#Merkel travels late, but at least to the #USA. #Trumps America-first policy means that Germany as an export nation is at stake nothing less than prosperity. Merkel has to convince Trump that a new deal with Europe is better than a #trade war. CL"
The @HeikoMaas has a completely different view of #Assad than the @cducsubt - #Putin puts such a disagreement on the cards. How about Oslo-style negotiations behind closed doors? CL
Strong signal from victories: # lpt18 @fdp_nrw confirms @JoachimStamp very impressively. This shows the satisfaction with our government work and that the change of leadership was successful. I am happy for my successor! CL
The @CDU and @dieLinke as coalition parties in #Brandenburg. With this &quot;pragmatism&quot; #Adenauer and #Kohl are routing in the grave. It is not only a question of adding mandates - basic principles also count. #Socialism #Market economy #Democracy CL
"If the citizens showed the same ambition as the government in #Meseberg, it would look bad. Nothing about digitization, Agenda 2030, best education &amp; no answer to Macron. CL"
We fear this too and will therefore keep a close eye on it! TL
"BVerfG decision on #Grundsteuer revealed: (old) GroKo has been idle for far too long, can now not present a well thought-out alternative. Reform must not now lead to an increase in the total volume. CL"
The next but one FDP interview is with me again ... before that applies: we are many and not a one-man party;) CL
"We are thinking of the injured and the relatives of all victims of # Münster. A horrific, incomprehensible act. CL"
#Spahn is concerned with &quot;law and order&quot;. I am concerned about his memory: @cducsubt has been the Federal Minister of the Interior since 2005 ... CL
"Limits for # nitrogen oxides have been set more or less randomly, at least under false assumptions. We should focus on smart solutions for a new generation of vehicles: through #technology openness and intelligent traffic solutions. CL #Diesel"
"#MartinLutherKing was murdered 50 years ago today. His legacy is more current than ever: not to ask where someone comes from or what he believes in, but where he wants to go with us. CL"
"Unlike in summer 2015, there shouldn&#39;t be any unannounced solo going now. But after informing our European partners, registered refugees should be rejected again at the border. CL #seehofer"
"#Ireland is considered an example of possible “asymmetrical shocks” because of the #Brexit, which is why Ms. #Merkel encourages short-term credit lines in a “monetary fund”. Foreign Minister @simoncoveney visited @fdpbt and said: &quot;Economy on track - we don&#39;t need it.&quot; Aha! CL pic.twitter.com/UhJF6bRXQl"
"I have to protect my colleague: she didn&#39;t say that my suggestions were correct. On the contrary, as it justifies. CL"
@GoeringEckardt regrets #Jamaika&#39;s failure at # TDImmo18 - and receives applause. Now I&#39;m curious to see whether the audience will be enthusiastic about their positions. Keyword straight: &quot;half-hearted rent brake&quot;. ;) CL
"The conflict #Merkel vs. #Seehofer touches on the essence of the chancellorship - the summer of 2015. Planned or just happened: credibility is at stake for both of them. Incidentally, @spdbt is silent - no opinion or does the coalition crisis come after the Union conflict? CL"
"Not only #Groko is divided on immigration policy, so are the Union parties. In reality, #Seehofer asks the question of power whether it is stronger than #Merkel&#39;s guideline competence and the coalition agreement ... CL"
The result of #Singapore is just a vague declaration of intent without a schedule. Whether it is a start will be seen much later. One can only hope for it. CL #TrumpKimSummit
Tomorrow no #master plan for the #asylum of Horst #Seehofer? Ms. #Merkel still clearly does not want a real change in immigration policy towards control and regulation. Hopefully the Union will soon agree internally. CL
Better late than never: @peteraltmaier admits in line with the start of # CEBIT18 in @handelsblatt: &quot;I admit that I would have preferred a stronger concentration of power and skills in some key areas.&quot; We finally need a #Digital Ministry! CL
