Thank you :)

"So, are we talking about digitalization? #tvduell"
The most important news for me about #tvduell: The undecided were convinced by Schulz. http://m.kn-online.de/News/Aktuelle-Politik-Nachrichten/Nachrichten-Politik-aus-der-Welt/Patt-im-TV-Duell-aber-Schulz-holt-die-Unentschiedenen#link_time= 1504473656‚Ä¶
I think a second duel on these topics is correct. Hey @CDU is your chair there? https://twitter.com/martinschulz/status/904449171289235457‚Ä¶
There will be a lot of calls tomorrow #tvduell
Wow. Completely below the level of a CDU campaigner. #tvduell https://twitter.com/peterrneumann/status/904413216960376833‚Ä¶
In the last picture you look very likeable. I like how you get over there!
"First part of the ax! With a second vote, I also convince you."
I wouldn&#39;t have estimated you that old :)
I do not know
Come to Munster first!
Where did a party leader / candidate for chancellor say that?
"At the last #tvduell, Merkel said the toll is not coming. This time she said the pension at 70 is not coming. Be warned!"
"So I have to say, there are very big differences between Merkel and Schulz. #Erdogan # Turkey #EUcommission #tvduell"
And the question of how Alessio is doing!
you have to read the right things
Wait!
Congratulations! Does your wish rule out 6-7 goals?
"With us, the players identify with the club!"
Good thing that you are now an ex-BVB fan!
The interior minister didn&#39;t want it. Have to make a new attempt in the upcoming legislature.
There. https://twitter.com/tobiasduenow/status/900384211307286528‚Ä¶

"The answer is: Markus S√∂der, right? https://twitter.com/hahnflo/status/899749288212922368‚Ä¶"
I recognize that you are trying to get something out. üòâ
Right
so I&#39;m still here for an hour ...
"Interim conclusion: @MartinSchulz has given answers. Merkel wants to look again, gets the number and talks to Horst. #townhall"
"Ok, I&#39;m not objective. But that&#39;s not really strong right? #townhall #merkel"
My opinion that the district of Hameln has returned all the money: https://www.neue-woche.com/lokales/nachrichten-landkreis/50-millionen-mammut-projekt-internetausbau-schlaegt-der-landkreis-15-millionen- funding-from‚Ä¶
Or is returned.
"Are so many cities and towns, localities. Not to forget the velvet communities."
"Munster, Heidekreis, Rotenburg. Nice here."
It is very convincing.
And now in the entrance area

are
"Hello @RTLde, strong, informative format for you with the #Warenarena. When does Merkel come?"
There were times when the JU still knew what was decency. Unfortunately that is over. Sad &amp; embarrassing at the same time. https://twitter.com/junge_union/status/896729066069479424‚Ä¶
Especially on the way to the kicker.
Oh really? Where? Come room
Juhu!
who am I going to meet in Cologne today? # Gamescom17 #gamescom
I do.
This is my campaign center :)
Fine. The large areas are there. I like to stand next to @c_lindner. Especially since he now has a real shirt on;) pic.twitter.com/5rExOLOdph
Keep calm. Just getting started.
Althusmann says that he had with Twesten on July 28th. talked for the first time. The @neuepresse reveals: At least in early June. Honestly it works differently!
"Summer Interview by @MartinSchulz can not see yet. But just as JUler and CDU employees go crazy here, I suspect: It was good."
Write the book in English! Nice weekend.
Congratulation! How does that feel? Will threaten me soon.
My first banana ...
"The staged outrage of the CDU Lower Saxony is embarrassing. I&#39;m excited to see what else comes out of it! https://mobil.nwzonline.de/wirtschaft/hannover-wolfsburg-landesregierung-in-niedersachsen-vw-sprach-sich-auch-mit-cdu-und-fdp-ab_a_32,0,1851667053.html‚Ä¶"

"Keene clue. Was a snapshot from last year, not a picture."
Haha. I didn&#39;t know you were hanging around at fashion fairs in Milan #manlerntnieaus

Only government!
Thanks for the idea!

"Yes, but please don&#39;t tell anyone, ok?"
I have not worked through.
Not correct.
Haha. Don&#39;t worry;)
Troll.
Better?

Steinmeier has always condemned the annexation of the Crimea. Never relativized.
Will not happen
"High VW people want to get rid of because he&#39;s too critical? CDU has known about &quot;allegations&quot; for a long time? Clarification please, Mr. Althusmann! https://twitter.com/zdfheute/status/894607721034534912‚Ä¶"

How did it end? Was in appointments. Last looked in the 87th minute. May I congratulate you?
"In the press conference, she mentioned candidacy for the Bundestag or the European Parliament."
That I&#39;m looking forward to the duel from SPD members? Then I will still be in the SPD.
Come on
"Clear announcement from @stephanweil. Voters should decide, not an intrigue."
"That means :), thanks for the flowers."
"This is a person poster, theme posters are still coming."
"No thing. If you come from Munster, are a soldier&#39;s son and have studied security policy, you may go to the tank museum ..."
I asked about Union
You know my biography. You are welcome to ask the soldiers in Munster if they feel well represented by me;).
Many thanks!!!!

get post from @hahnflo .... pic.twitter.com/A375yMpjTU
it has not yet been held.
That&#39;s just the beginning! From tomorrow you will get the best SPD speeches streamed straight to the kitchen!
Haha
"A7? Use detour via Platzrandstrasse. Signposted, but sat navs do not indicate that."
"Shouldn&#39;t ask us who uses a topic. More like if you should take care of it. In any case, we do not solve problems with silence."
"We have all noticed that somehow, yes."
we want it to go ahead. good if something moves.
yes you are already cute;)
now they take off a little ... pic.twitter.com/56ypZCJToU
and you learn something!
Pffft.
Ok
How was the hit move?
What is the Union&#39;s position on the ceiling? investments? pension increase?
Is that your reaction to &quot;Ideas for Germany&quot;? Many people are fed up with this kind of skirmish ...
OMG. Serious attempt at debate?
Good! Then we talk about it
Do we have. The colleague from Notz will be able to confirm to you that @EskenSaskia and I have discussed this again and again.
Then let&#39;s argue about it. Would be more exciting for everyone.
"Unfortunately, the issue has not had the necessary importance in the entire political landscape. I am glad that it is gaining ground now"
Let&#39;s talk about the different ideas in the election campaign about how to advance this country. Would be exciting. #lasttweet
SPD makes suggestions to advance the country. Other parties have no idea. So criticism is always: But you co-governed !!!!
I thought you were no longer commenting on Constantine!
You still won&#39;t get any ID!
"Top priority in the speeches, yes. Right üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
I refrain from any answer.
That is analyzed in detail. But have not provided the responsible interior minister or the BK for 12 years.
"@muskelberg is celebrating its birthday today! congratulations, let&#39;s celebrate properly!"
Which party provided the interior ministers for 12 years? You always howl around ...
Buy one.
"But where the @hubertus_heil is right :) # 12year-regulatednothing happened - we accelerate, I promise!"
"The @MartinSchulz says: The state must finally go online. Merkel says: Oh great, I want it too. üòÇ # 12jahreregiertnixpassiert"
Nope I only work with Apple!
on the way #FutureSPD

Does it say that I&#39;m competing? You have wishes;)
Elke Twesten expressed interest today to stand here with us in 2021 for the CDU for the Bundestag. I&#39;m looking forward to the duel!
