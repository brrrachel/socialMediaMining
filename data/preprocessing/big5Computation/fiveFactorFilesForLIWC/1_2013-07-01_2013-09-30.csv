@DerMichaAusCGN Hi ???
@orangesolar I am constantly insulted from the industry: really great strategy! :-)
@orangesolar I always said that I don&#39;t want any further cuts for PV because the law works. Instead of recognition and praise
@orangesolar because an addition of around 10% per year is more sustainable and technically easier to cope with. Boom is always stupid.
@orangesolar 52 GW are reached. PV is on the way to marketability !!! And that&#39;s good!
"@orangesolar the countermeasures come automatically when the addition falls below 2,500. But I&#39;m sure that it is higher, even if"

@AutorToto @welt I think Hollande learned the trade from the former red-green federal government as opposition leader!

"@drumheadberlin The good thing is, you always know afterwards!"
"@drumheadberlin Of course not, but for decades neither the phone nor the car believed it. Not even from the plane."
@alpenwilli Schnellmermer !!!!!!!!!!!! :-)))))))
"@drumheadberlin Evolution always comes from minorities. 80 years after the invention of the telephone in my street only 2 people had one, today everyone!"
@Ralf_Bruno_ I wouldn&#39;t be eloquent if I had the wrong job. But it can still be right for that!
@ WNP7013 but we can talk and work for it and that is exactly what the federal government is doing
"@ WNP7013 The level of your tweets is simply awesome! The whale threat does not come from D, and outside we cannot force anyone"
"@MediterrNewsNet @guillaumetc Of course, there have been maps for 20 years! Even prettier than Che."

"@ GrumpyPeer1 but I send you a compliment! You do the thing very agile! Better than the other peer, you are really good, what more could you want!"
"@ GrumpyPeer1 I love Saarland far too much, I love it even more on vacation, so unfortunately I have no time for RT&#39;s and for other leaders."
@pv_forum :-))
@trebbianos Sure?
@ jolicoeur11 ???? :-) ????
Now get me off the field. Dream that the network is only good and privacy is absolute. Tomorrow again work in the here and today
"@pv_forum but nobody cares, although they are people too, with families and spouses."
"@pv_forum There is also no right to subsidy. We cut hundreds of thousands of jobs in mining, now thousands at nuclear plants,"
@pv_forum to be more successful internationally. The companies that are broke today were not interested at the time.
@pv_forum got. What is said about me on the web is honorable. By the way: I proposed a large consortium last year
@pv_forum double the level of expansion in 2011 and has since heard the most abusive insults from those I protect with it
"@pv_forum In a time when many wanted to wipe it out, I ensured the PV perspective of a subsidy of 52 GW, twice that"
@pv_forum You overlook that SPD u Greens voted. With their immense criticism you isolate yourself and lose all support
"@Ralf_Bruno_ @trebbianos Only that we still needed the other power plants because the sun, for example, does not shine at night ..."
@pv_forum @Ralf_Bruno_ Then we wouldn&#39;t have more than 10% growth this year. Nowhere else.
"With Handy u Netz we have the knowledge of the world in our pockets, but we have to be careful that the world is not in our pockets :-)"
@AnimalFirst_ ready!
@Dave_Kay very simple: because the total installed capacity is still increasing strongly: this year by over 10%!
"@Doucetephemere somebody has to pay, we can&#39;t pay it for the whole world. If PV gets cheaper, the world can afford it."
"@CRther yes, we have 80 GW production capacity on the world market, but only 40 GW sales. That is why everyone makes losses worldwide."
"@MainKinzigSolar They are alo because, of the 25,000 MW PV installed since 2010, unfortunately only 15% came from Germany!"
". @ Ralf_Bruno_ mischief! If PV expansion pace continues as under my responsibility, the installed capacity will double in 10 J."
The impressive success of the photovoltaic reform shows that you can drive the energy transition forward and still limit costs effectively!
@WWSPower @bmu_de as I said: I have no way to ban because of lack of responsibility. Unfortunately
@ FI_360gamer skeptical
“@BMU_de: Whale protection: @peteraltmaier asks German ports to refrain from #Walfleisch transit http://bit.ly/1dhwZne”
@MrZeabird I don&#39;t really believe it. But the SPD seems to have a lot of jitters.

"Neither delete nor edit @csommer so quickly. Other mails are then spilled. Result: I will get a new account, this one"
@csommer Try to understand: It is the account that I work on while traveling. Important things for the environment. I can check the mail
@ zimmi69 thank you! I&#39;m happy for that!
@flueke we do not take that very seriously in Saarland!
@ mapro67 electricity from renewables is funded with around 20 billion euros annually!

@UdoSieverding Pst! Otherwise you might scare off the followers! :-)
@JTrittin :-))
@pv_forum @peterschuth you always do that :-)) Good night!
"@pv_forum @piratmatt @zoernert yes, they have to call the press office. They send them that."
"@pv_forum @peterschuth of course I stand by it, that only applies to funding under the EEG. An unlimited amount can be built without funding"
"I have no plans for @PhilippRassGmbH either! As it is now, it&#39;s basically good."
@AVANTAGEnergy always in principle! They just have to say who you are and what your concerns are!
"@pv_forum @peterschuth not me, but the Bundestag and Bundestag with a huge majority!"
"@zoernert @piratmatt @pv_forum from EEG, he is not exempt. From network charges, that is the responsibility of Philip Rösler"
@KarlFSchmidt Thank you! And nice evening!
"@OliSPunkt Congratulations! If that had done more, we would have some problems less!"
@Volker_Beck @markussuedwitz @sigmargabriel think about whether I should take legal steps! :-)
"@offsonic unfortunately only in Dutch, English, French. I can only read Spanish"
"@PiratMatt @zoernert @pv_forum totally wrong, not a single golf course is EEG free - all just baiting"
@csickendieck :-))
@solarguide Why? This year 40 GW and in D 4 GW PV will be built worldwide! The word extermination is wrong and does not work at all!
"@rolfk You have overlooked the fact that we have been at 5.3 ct since 1.1.2013, from 1.1.14 we will add another cent if we do nothing"
"@ berock1 Error: after a lap of honor: -) - we did not extend the run times but shortened them, and also switched off 8 nuclear power plants"
"@trebbianos not at all, the stock prices of the 4 big ones have been descending for quite some time."
The @JTrittin once said that the energy turnaround costs as much as a scoop of ice cream every month - now you can eat the ice cream card up and down!
"@pv_forum I wanted to save 700 million on exemptions, but red-green did not take part"
@trebbianos The EE are not a license to print money but an instrument for climate protection. Whoever separates garbage even has to pay for it.
Now get me off the field. Read you
@solarguide law was also passed by the SPD and the Greens as well as 16 federal states. The jobs previously disappeared - despite the expansion record

"@pv_forum as I said xmal: job losses have nothing to do with cuts, because we had expansion records, but unfortunately with modules from China."
@solarpolis nice that you were there and: goodbye!
"@jmbverlag It is particularly worthwhile if you want to consume a significant tril of the current yourself: clubmate, floodlight .."
@pv_forum Exactly! I want a strong PV and that&#39;s why I protect it against unjustified accusations

@SecondSol 3/4 of the PV in D have been built since 2010. There has never been as much PV as now. You take extermination back or I have to block you.

"@youdaz No, but you can send laundry baskets with letters, or email / Twitter lists with the number of protesters. Then it works more"
@The_mixer I think - I think - very quickly. Question to you: Why do you misspell my name?
@csommer citizens will then find it harder to reach me directly.
@csommer never. But this is an initiated action that paralyzes my email account. So I have to change it
@ write locker laundry baskets are fully ok. But this is about the account that all my office work runs through and that I read all the time.
@ writing block I did that. Then they changed the headings.
@youdaz Some dozen other emails from citizens are lost because I can no longer find them.
"@youdaz I use this account for my communication, read all mails myself and this is no longer possible."
"@youdaz No, unless you block the way to work or the doctor for others without being able to avoid it."
"@Aproonline @greenpeace_de Make an effort, I will not find it because the spam comes in every second"
then no longer give @greenpeace_de. And one less chance for citizens to communicate directly with the minister. Then it&#39;s your fault
"@greenpeace_de no, you create my account labhm with identical mails. This is outrageous and short-sighted, because it becomes this account"
@greenpeace_tr I haven&#39;t been able to use it for hours. Grennpeace.de has not even replied to my tweets. Underground
@greenpeace_tr The press office has nothing to do with it. It is my personal account as a BMU to which all my mails come.
