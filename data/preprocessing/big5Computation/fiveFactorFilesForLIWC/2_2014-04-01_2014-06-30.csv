Common sense. Are you for that? “@Kilianmartin: UKIP rhetoric course? RT @JuliaKloeckner: Those who accept Sharia law are crazy ”
Sharia does not foresee a death penalty for someone who overrides other beliefs in Islam. Why discrimination against other religions?

"Incredible, the Green RLP cannot think of anything other than the current death sentence against Christin Sudan other than that one also has to think of Muslims # Sharia"
Barbarism against Christians and women in Sudan! Sharia law and death sentence - that cannot be a will of God or a love of neighbor!
