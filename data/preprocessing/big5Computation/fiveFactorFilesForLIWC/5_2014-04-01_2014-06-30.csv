Good debate with @Klaus_Mueller in the consumer committee of the German Bundestag

"@martinkaul yes, discussions with the Brazilian side were good"
@martinkaul So easy to please? :-) @Strandreporter @KlaubertD
"@ Beach reporter But in the district, not on the beach :-)"
"@BabettesChefin Such nonsense! Decisions are made jointly in a coalition, it doesn&#39;t matter where the division is. Harmful gimmick"
@PeterMeiwald @GrueneBundestag Kindergarten level! Should we list what you could not implement in coalitions (Hessen!)?
It is also worth following @EskenSaskia
Having to sit in the plenum for 12 hours at a time is also not really healthy. I&#39;ll take a half hour break to run
@LukasMrokon Oops
"@LukasMrokon on iOS, I haven&#39;t had a single crash yet. What operating system are you using?"
@PatrickLauer &quot;Age (!) Bonner&quot;? This is cheeky :-)
Good Morning. Longer plenary day today
"After question time in the Bundestag and discussion with the retail association, now a discussion on collective legal protection"
@wurstsack So it is
"@DerTobic No, feed or raw material plants are also dangerous in the field"
Consumer protection means preventing the cultivation of genetically modified plants. States must also from European. Can swerve approval

The @MartinSchulz is really a top European candidate that you can show. Others hide their candidates :-)
Nice promise from @MartinSchulz to NRW and Bonn that an information office of the European Parliament will be set up here. Thanks a lot!
Good Morning

We were able to honor many party members for longstanding membership today. The Bonn SPD has recently become the party with the largest number of members

"@ victor5679 And also about freedom of the press, separation of powers and protection of minorities? Also from the principle &quot;Every vote is worth the same amount&quot;?"
Good Morning
@frederics @petertauber 28 EU member states! You and the CDU should only do without Berlusconi and the semi-dictatorial Fidesz
"@frederics @petertauber Maybe not from the EPP, but political groups are formed each time. And this question remains"
@ victor5679 But that was the weakest argument of yours that I have ever experienced ...
@ victor5679 @EinAugenschmaus @petertauber Unfortunately not only ...
. @ petertauber The question is simple: will the CDU in the EP again form a common faction with Berlusconi / Orbán or not? Yes / No is enough!
@the_necrosis That (!) is probably not the problem with TTIP ...
@HeikeMobil not there either

@phillukas Rightly so
"@phillukas Yes, because that also includes saying your opinion about @SWagenknecht"
@BabettesChefin Small check you haven&#39;t got it? In my city you are coalitioning with the CDU. It is about the CDU / Berlusconi parliamentary group
"Zitat EPP-Website: &quot;The EPP is the political family of the center-right.&quot; Familie (!) Honest CDU / CSU, Berlusconi und Orban-Fidesz"
"@marktzyniker But you see the difference between the parliamentary group and the coalition, right?"
You have to know: CDU / CSU want to continue (!) Together with Berlusconi&#39;s party to form a fraction after the European elections http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/berlusconi-beleidigt-deutsche-mit-nazi-kz-und- holocaust-spruechen-a-966349.html…
"@creohn No, it&#39;s the struggle for majorities and the need to compromise in a group."
"You can&#39;t really criticize that the grand coalition is proud of your projects, dear opposition. But where is the counter-concept?"
Good Morning!
Green tactics to accuse SPD 2014 of not yet implementing all programs 2014-2017 will wear out quickly #non-sustainable
"In 2006, Gysi, Trittin and Westerwelle defied the government with general debate. This time opposition completely on the trail"
"It&#39;s a good thing that opposition now begins in the general debate. However, for your other quality, rather weak speech from @katjakipping"
@ ge12345ge Please differentiate! Need counterbalance to corporate lobbyists in Brussels. Money well spent
Good Morning!

"@kritischergeist Right-wing populists are, for example, those who make &quot;foreigners&quot; and &quot;Europe&quot; scapegoats of their own mistakes"
Hardly known: in 1973 the CDU / CSU almost prevented the Internet in Germany :-) https://www.facebook.com/UlrichKelber/posts/545667088884540:0…
. @ wanderwitz nonsense! At least listen to your chancellor and interior minister before you panic here
"With the # VDS judgment of the EUGH, the previous basis coalition agreement no longer applies. Now there will be an open-ended new discussion in Germany and the EU"
@kritischergeist Please read my tweet again. The charge was that of working together with right-wing populists in a common faction
@auchmorgen So we agree: grand coalition reduces debt!
Stop making right-wing populists hopeful. The CDU / CSU are currently forming a parliamentary group in the European Parliament together with the Orbán and Berlusconi parties
Sad: @ express24 and @ radiobonn reporters Walter Hardy died after a long illness. Nice that we could still celebrate Carnival
@auchmorgen To pay off additional debt while the infrastructure is crumbling would be to exchange one debt for another
