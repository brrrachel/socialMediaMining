"@ArminLaschet Both will probably change soon. For CDU, do you exclude cooperation with AFD right-wing populists at all levels?"
"Good work that is paid properly remains the key to social security, not this neo-liberal curd of funded schemes!"

"AFD funds its right-wing populist mischief through gold sales. Tomorrow Lucke will advertise rheumatoid blankets. Untrustworthy, dangerous job killers."
"Zig-zag SH Opposition: Only corruption registers are condemned, since innocent people would be criminalized, the opposite occurs, law &quot;superfluous&quot;."
"Unfortunately, it is always the case that every time you oppose the right lack of understanding, you experience the flood of intolerance + brainlessness."
"Good news on the phone. For this, my website overflows with right comments from AFD sympathizers + hollow heads."

Reading fruits (5) FDP Vice Kubicki speaks of twitches in Hamburg FDP. They outsource and found subsidiary micropolitics!

"Unfortunately, the first speech on constitutional reform did not show the necessary impartiality. So two CDU speeches in a row. Well ...."
Colleague G√ºnther shows the reactionary side of the Union in terms of equality - this is what modernization with the new opposition leader looks like!
Incredibly right! &quot;@ SteinbachErika:&quot; Kurds + Salafist street battle http://faz.net/-gpf-7utyu So peaceful can be multicultural ;-))) &quot;

"@sixtus @petertauber You really have to be very brave: The SPD rules in 14 of the 16 countries (coming soon), and in almost all major cities!"
"@arne_de they obviously have a sense of humor; before I get restless, a lot more has to happen than getting a new CDU colleague for the fourth time ;-)"

"Basically, you feel pity for those who are looking for satisfaction in this way, and not infrequently anonymously - with rabble on the net."
"It is good to endure, you just shouldn&#39;t confuse it with reality."
Wonder what all the trolls did with their mental garbage before there was Twitter and Facebook? Democracy means they can!
