"Anyone who shreds a chick alive is accused. On the other hand, whoever shreds millions of chicks still receives subsidies. We have to break through this system of organized agricultural crime."
"Although killing animals for no reasonable reason is prohibited, 45 million male chicks are killed every year - now even with the permission of the Supreme Administrative Court. Crimes against animals are tolerated as long as they take place for economic reasons."
"Surgical amputation, such as cutting off curly tails in pigs, is forbidden and only allowed in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, it is the rule and the minister even wants to allow it with her so-called animal welfare label."
But we don&#39;t have to fool ourselves: the animal husbandry standards in agriculture are incompatible with the claim of the Animal Welfare Act.
"I therefore expect the minister responsible to analyze the causes and plan how the authorities can improve the protection of animals. Police &amp; justice not only have to be better equipped, they have to be better sensitized + trained to cruelty to animals."
