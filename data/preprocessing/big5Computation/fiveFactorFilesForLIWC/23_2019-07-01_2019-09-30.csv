It is high time to make our agriculture future-proof and to significantly reduce the number of animals. I expect from Minister # Klöckner that she is now presenting a corresponding #agiculture strategy and is adapting the regulations for #use-keeping.
"This includes protecting and building #Humus, integrating hedges and trees into the fields and completely rethinking water management. The use of energy-intensive #pesticides and synthetic fertilizers must also be stopped soon."
"If we want to secure long-term yields, we have to regenerate the ecosystems in which we operate. Instead of adapting the ecosystems to industrial agriculture, we have to adapt our management to the ecosystems."

"To this end, the CAP must be brought into coherence with #development cooperation, which focuses on strengthening resilient agroecological structures. 14/14 / TK"

It is the task of the Commission to set ambitious targets that are valid across the EU for this area and to monitor compliance with them through clearly defined goals and indicators. 10/14

"4. Better farming has to be worthwhile So far, farmers who work more environmentally and animal-friendly have only received compensation. 7.14"
particularly support companies in meeting these challenges. There should be an upper limit for agricultural payments for large farms. 6.14
3. Agricultural payments must be fairer Investments in better agriculture are often more difficult to manage for small and medium-sized businesses than for large ones. Agricultural policy must take this into account and 05/14
"2. More money for #natural conservation As part of the CAP, we call for a nature conservation fund of 15 billion euros annually for nature conservation measures in the agricultural landscape. 4.14"

"Anyone who shreds a chick alive is accused. On the other hand, whoever shreds millions of chicks still receives subsidies. We have to break through this system of organized agricultural crime."
"Although killing animals for no reasonable reason is prohibited, 45 million male chicks are killed every year - now even with the permission of the Supreme Administrative Court. Crimes against animals are tolerated as long as they take place for economic reasons."
"Surgical amputation, such as cutting off curly tails in pigs, is forbidden and only allowed in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, it is the rule and the minister even wants to allow it with her so-called animal welfare label."
But we don&#39;t have to fool ourselves: the animal husbandry standards in agriculture are incompatible with the claim of the Animal Welfare Act.
"I therefore expect the minister responsible to analyze the causes and plan how the authorities can improve the protection of animals. Police &amp; justice not only have to be better equipped, they have to be better sensitized + trained to cruelty to animals."
"Animals are among the weakest in society and deserve better protection. Not only are the federal states there, the federal government is also responsible."
