I find that the continued outrage at the method and results of the Council begins to mix with determination. The argument goes on for a long time. The anti-democratic alliance from Victor to Jupiter does not win in the end.
That is an imposition. But the disagreement in the EP has opened the door for that.

"No, it&#39;s not cheap. I am of the opinion that it would have been a woman if it had been rejected, because the EPP and the Council could not have gone back after that."
My first speech in the new EP: last night we debated the EU&#39;s Global Strategy. I marked some deficits. http://bit.ly/2GfJXtY #globalstrategy
As I see it: Brief commentary on the election of Ursula #vonderLeyen as #eukommissionspraesidentin: http://bit.ly/2Y3nIRX
"Really now, Michael, relax again. Watch my video, I look ahead. And knows that the vast majority will need us. And that&#39;s good."
"I don&#39;t want to say anything, but it is certain that she had 14 votes from M5S. PiS is rumored. That means, and I find it interesting, that their support for S&amp;D, Renew and EVP was less than many thought. For us, this means that in many cases they will need us."
Clear. :-)
And with dissatisfied EVP / Renew / S&amp;D colleagues. Why should we be to blame if she doesn&#39;t get her own troops together?
"You missed a lot. For example, in a completely new process, we campaigned for Parliament to have an effective influence on the agenda for the next 5 years. We have campaigned for a right of initiative that should (almost) exist now. Etc."
I&#39;m far-sighted. ;-)
Of course this is hypothetically conceivable. :-) But at the moment I don&#39;t feel any relevant deficits on our site.
Of course there was an alternative. But that&#39;s cold coffee now.
"I&#39;m very proud of being stubborn. It is wrong, however, that we wavered in our arguments."
"Since the European elections, we have been working hard to bring about a political change in the EU institutions, of course in compromises with others. Ms. vdL falls short of what is necessary. Developed consensus was zeroed out again. Not enough change."
You have insufficient knowledge of geography.
"You made a great point there, @Potomaker. ;-) Yes, we have freedom of expression. And of course we like to learn from colleagues. But, to paraphrase your esteemed taz colleague: it is doubtful whether these two represent a green majority. :-) https://twitter.com/Potomaker/status/1151071593847824386…"
"Good speech, undisputed. And is that good enough for approval? Interesting."
"Unfortunately, agriculture was not mentioned in the Leyens speech. When it came to the subject, she couldn&#39;t have pretended that the necessary departure and far-reaching continuation could be agreed. https://twitter.com/RenateKuenast/status/1151058640046055425…"
Do you do politics in SH? :-P
"Your insight is, as always, deep, comprehensive and delightful. ;-)"
Maybe she can and wants to. We will certainly work on that. Today we decide on the basis that it actually offers.
"Nice polemic, but doesn&#39;t go far. Rhethoric and program are two different things. And you could easily spot the substantial gaps between the headings if you wanted. https://twitter.com/CarloMasala1/status/1151032890651754497…"
"The distribution of the applause in the debate about the presentation of the Leyens shows that politically the camps of ECR, ID and M5S as well as Brexit party are merging more and more."
And.
A remarkable contrast in numbers: Von Leyen said 500 million people in the EU &quot;live in prosperity&quot;; Schirdewan (GUE) pointed out that over 110 million people in the EU live in poverty or risk of poverty.
"The most absurd speech in the first round of debate came again from Nigel Farage, who actually accused Leyen of &quot;communism&quot;."
"""Responding with a legislative act"" is in my reading not the same as transforming an initiative from parliament into a legislative act. The ""response"" could be in line with parliament's intentions or, maybe, not."
That would have been an alternative.
You&#39;re right. Only that we are willing and willing to compromise in order to change direction in European politics. The refusal to compromise was not on our side. The EPP and @vonderleyen withdrew from negotiated compromises.
The word &quot;climate hysteria&quot; characterizes those who use it as irresponsible idiots.
Or are you a troll anyways?
"As all arguments against vdL seem to be silly to you, I do not really expect to land a single argument with you. But here is my try: Don't you believe that drawing a line against the extreme right starts with rejecting their votes? Or is accepting their votes a way to fight them?"
"So, do I get you right: you think that it makes no difference, whether a candidate says that he/she wants to draw a line against the extreme right?"
It is clear that Greens / EFA could not be persuaded to promise @vonderleyen with the promise of a commissioner. We want a change of policy. Excluding greens from the commission is always unwise and contradicts the spirit of the treaties.
"Since @vonderleyen was nominated in a move away from the #top candidate model, she cannot stick to vague considerations at this point without the EP having to conclude that she has no objection to this move away."
A # democratically important point at which @ManfredWeber had promised to deliver and from which @vonderleyen is now withdrawing is the #initiative right for the European Parliament.
"If @vonderleyen can be voted for with votes from the far right, this also means: The demarcation from green positions, which were massively strengthened in the European elections, is more important to her than the clear dividing line to the right."
"The CSU learner @ManfredWeber was ready to make concessions on content that @vonderleyen has not yet taken up again. In my view, the Weber-vonderLeyen comparison is: minus the top candidate, minus the content of the positions. It is clear that this will not be a plus."
"Without votes from the far right, @vonderleyen has not had a majority; many observers agree on this. Unlike @ManfredWeber, she has never ruled out the right-wing vote. Interesting political shift by the oh so liberal candidate."
Not all cups in the closet?

I would say we have to reinvent the interest in compromise and the ability to make it happen. I imagine that we Greens have so far been more willing to compromise than others. But never mind. The Szydło debacle in the EMPL is also part of the problem.
"Well, maybe we can&#39;t expect vdL to take over our entire program. But the most important and popular 10-15 percent are!"
"I see it differently. In my opinion #vonderLeyen currently has no majority. Inside the EPP, she was warned of the risk of a vote next week. If she doesn&#39;t try to put off, the risk of failure is extremely high. https://twitter.com/UlrichSchulte/status/1149067193688236032…"

Dear @DerSPIEGEL: You write about von der Leyen: &quot;Your tactic: Be nice - and stay as vague as possible. The Greens anyway want to vote against them.&quot; How do you come up with &quot;anyway&quot;? I would say: because of that.
Forgive me!
I do not know.
"Well, from a defense minister, who wants to change arms export policy and advocates a common European approach to the issue, I would expect, that she knows the state of play. That is a rather modest standard. https://twitter.com/MKarnitschnig/status/1149049025590697985 …"

Asking this question means answering it. https://twitter.com/UlrichSchulte/status/1148989652860358656…
That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. ;-)
"Little surprise in von der Leyen hearing: in her own field of responsibility, defense, she seems to be unacquainted with the Common Position on arms exports, believing it represents a parliament decision. And refuses to answer the question whether it should become community law."
What do I have to do to get it? ;-)
Nationalist nonsense and over the topic.
:-)
"It can be assumed that we strive to be constructive. We were all the time. But I don&#39;t see us in the debt. How constructive are EVP, S&amp;D and Renew? Are you sticking to the consensus that we had negotiated?"
&quot;But Bütikofer and Trittin do not represent the inner green majority.&quot; The sentence is worth noting. :-) But how does @taz know that? You shouldn&#39;t underestimate old hands. ;-) https://taz.de/EU-Kommissionspraesidentin-von-der-Leyen/!5610440/…

You fighting cocks! How can Europe ever find one another if not even its good journalists can? Or are we just getting together through an argument? ;-)
"Now not so squeamish, dear @StephanIsrael! I quoted a blog that operated extensively with this word, which points to a not unimportant debate a few years ago. And: No, I wouldn&#39;t call @ManfredWeber that way."
