@knarfmos No.
Merkel has pursued a policy that reduces the relationship between the EU partners to mutual liability and financial transfers.
@ join13luck International law is not arbitrary.
Social tourists? Germany is the second most popular travel destination for European tourists. I don&#39;t know why Kauder is bothered by them.
"As long as politicians do not prevent surveillance of telecommunications + on the Internet, they themselves remain monitored. #Erdogan"
A deployment of German military east of the Oder is also historically prohibited. #NATO #Federal #Ukraine
#Merkel must now be at the forefront of seeking dialogue instead of preparing for NATO&#39;s # NATO maneuvers. #Ukraine
"Greater military presence in the # NATO eastern states is escalating, although we desperately need de-escalation. #Ukraine"
"Dual citizenship is not a privilege. In Germany, then only the German applies, not the other. #Double pass #Optitude"
Multi-nationality must be generally accepted when naturalization + acquisition of German citizenship by birth in Germany.
Double citizenship: In 2013 @thomasoppermann wanted to be on par with the United States. With #Merkel it only extends to the navel.

#GroKo muddles through to 2017. The Union has no alternative. The SPD does not yet know whether it wants to become social democratic again.
100 days #GroKo: The performance of the Chancellor and her ministers is below average. The balance is more than lukewarm.

Former Chancellor Schmidt calls the sanctions against Russia &quot;stupid stuff&quot;. Merkel should not ignore the objections raised by her predecessors.

"The United States alone decides on their nuclear weapons in Germany, not we. If they are ever used, we will get the answer."

From March 7th to 16th the #Paralympics will take place in #Sochi. That should remind us all that we are committed to peace.
@FRenstedt We appeal to Putin to refrain from military action and to the interim government in Kiev to have a de-escalating effect.
"In 1914, the first catastrophe of the 20th century began with WW1. A new war in Europe must be prevented by all means #Ukraine"
@KonstantinNotz The EU and the federal government must approach Putin and seek dialogue. Ex-Chancellor Schröder could help.
"#Ukraine: talking instead of saber rattling, diplomacy, diplomacy, diplomacy! A solution can only be found with and not against Russia."
