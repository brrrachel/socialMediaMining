"Steinmeier: Without the involvement of our neighbors in the east and south, there will be no lasting peace in Europe. Courage is missing, not clarity."
Steinmeier: Heseltine could be right that Brexit will prove to be Britain&#39;s greatest loss of sovereignty.
"Steinmeier: If Europe does not become a full-fledged player on the international stage, all countries will become game balls."
Steinmeier: Europe is built on the assumption that the others could be right. But we resist those who exchange facts and lies.
"Steinmeier: Against national small mind, for European reason. We have to look seriously for ways to build bridges over ditches."
"&quot;Europe&#39;s future is not certain,&quot; says Steinmeier, &quot;we had known that for a long time. But we can get up again after defeats.&quot;"
