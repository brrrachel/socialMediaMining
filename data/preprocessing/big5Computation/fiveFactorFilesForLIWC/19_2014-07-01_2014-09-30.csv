@kurt_obruny The UN Security Council has to take a decision and the Member States have to deal with it - including Germany.
"Despite the bad relationship between the US and Russia, the UN Security Council has to adopt measures against IS terror."
"Obama&#39;s coalition of the willing against IS is against international law + primarily enforces interests of the USA, not international law."
@ Flose1905 Why? Do the federal government&#39;s own policy of peace policy depend on the policy of the US government?
"@smolinasan I understand the needs of the Catalans. As in Scotland now, everyone would have to accept the result."
"The federal government is trudging behind the self-proclaimed world police, the United States, without setting its own peace-political accents."
"Instead of repeatedly breaking international law, the five UN veto powers must finally live up to their responsibilities."
#Obama confuses the @WhiteHouse with the UN Security Council. Only there must the action against the IS terror army be decided.

The federal government should campaign for #EU-wide protection for #whistleblowers. #Assange #Snowden #WikiLeaks
@WBerchner Maybe a misunderstanding. My appeal is to everyone involved. I thought Klimkin’s tweet yesterday was correct.
"It is shameful that whistleblowers have to fear law enforcement at first, but find refuge in Russia + Latin America."
Sweden&#39;s law enforcement officers must be able to hear #Assange on the allegations. It must be protected from extradition to the United States.
# Ukraine-conflitk @PavloKlimkin: every additional hour at the negotiating table would be more sensible than bloodshed. Immediate ceasefire !!!
"Does nobody in the SPD believe they will have their own chancellor before 2021? This could be accelerated, but only with a 2020 social agenda."
Agenda 2010 brought the greatest social deprivation. Demands in the SPD for an agenda 2030 or 2040 sound like a threat.

International sports competitions are right + important for athletes + fans to meet + to exchange + so for tolerance + understanding.
"The House of Representatives should initiate an Olympic referendum, because I simply don&#39;t trust the current Senate to have a sustainable concept."
Berlin should not now apply for the 2024 or 2028 Olympics. SPD + CDU regularly forget to involve citizens.
"Merkel&#39;s policy on East Germany failed. There is a lack of justice in wages, pensions + recognition of work + life benefits."
Merkel&#39;s roadmap announced in 2017 for the alignment of Eastern pensioners by 2020 is another humiliation for millions of Eastern pensioners.
The East Germans have achieved remarkable things since 1989. This is not the success story of the federal government or its predecessors.
