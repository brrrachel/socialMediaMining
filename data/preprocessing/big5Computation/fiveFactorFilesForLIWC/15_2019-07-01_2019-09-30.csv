"‚ÄúIf you want it to stay the way it is, you have to change a lot,‚Äù @Markus_Soeder explains the active approach to bourgeois politics. District Party Congress #Augsburg"
"&quot;#Germany deserves better than a new left-wing alliance,&quot; said our chairman @Markus_Soeder at the district party conference in #Augsburg."
". @ Markus_Soeder: &quot;What the Grand Coalition needs is a new spirit. It has to show that it is a pleasure to govern, not a burden. ‚ÄúDistrict Party Congress @csu #Augsburg pic.twitter.com/7ueGQZ3vjc"
". @ Markus_Soeder: &quot;@csu is the strongest people&#39;s party in Germany, the determining force in Bavaria and we will remain that.&quot; District Party Congress #Augsburg pic.twitter.com/tM2JY1zLgt"
". @ Markus_Soeder: As Bavaria and as a CSU, we are clearly against any form of central school. We want to keep our Bavarian Abitur. #Federalism"
". @ Markus_Soeder: #Germany needs a concept for a climate tax reform: reduction of the #electricity tax, a complete reorganization of the # motor vehicle tax to ecological aspects and a # commuter fee that prevents commuters from being burdened more."
". @ Markus_Soeder: # CO2 pricing does not automatically mean increasing gasoline and mineral oil tax. #Climate protection must ultimately work in such a way that it is not an elite project, but that everyone can be taken away."
". @ Markus_Soeder: Become a Bavarian. #Introduce the climate protection law, closely interlinked with the federal government. Abundance of measures, e.g. forest reforestation, expansion of renewable #energy, want to increase again with #Photovoltaik, advance climate neutrality in buildings."
". @ Markus_Soeder: If the election of Ursula von der Leyen as President of the European Commission should ultimately fail because of the #SPD, it will be a heavy burden for the #coalition. It would be embarrassing for #Germany and the income for the SPD would be zero."

"The number of unemployed in Bavaria fell below 200,000 in June. That is the lowest value for June since 1991. We are pursuing a policy that secures jobs and growth. Today the CSU Presidium speaks to the Presidium of @vbw_bayern. pic.twitter.com/cT9E30w7MZ"
"Alexander Dobrindt: &quot;We need #climate protection as a movement that everyone can get involved in. It&#39;s not about stress, it&#39;s about reversing!&quot; #Incentives #Emissions trading"
. @ Markus_Soeder: &quot;#Climate protection must work with black zero. Anything else would be a fatal signal internationally.&quot; #Klimaklausur
