@am_klint Sehrn even surveys of the landlord side differently. Inexpensive apartments in particular are becoming significantly more expensive when tenants change
@am_klint And that is lower than before
@am_klint Rents in the portfolio cannot be increased at will. And certain increases are ineffective for # rent brake
Even those who do not move will benefit from the #lease price brake: comparative rents customary in the area and thus existing rents will increase more slowly
@tralamitti A positive return is also guaranteed with the # rent brake. But tenants are protected from exploitation of the predicament
