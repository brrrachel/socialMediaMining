today the #AfD is embarrassed. She wanted to claim the street and the capital for herself and failed with a crash. Perhaps permanent hatred is not sustainable motivation.

The connection between our dialogue on anti-Semitism and its millennia-old roots and your article has not really opened up to me.
Self-liberation and self-acquittal are two different terms. Anti-Semitism is not just another form of GMF.
"There are no categories for you beyond self-acquittal and condemnation. On the other hand, I assume that anti-Semitism is part of our cultural baggage, yours and mine. Those who reject this are often not sufficiently aware of it."

Maybe you don&#39;t read tweets selectively? I defend the headscarf as well and I strongly condemned the 2 racist attacks on Turks this week. They want to split up with their factual perception in order to artificially establish legitimacy for ADD.
Religious freedom in the Basic Law is a fundamental right without a legal reservation. It is therefore only allowed to intervene in order to protect constitutional goods of equal or higher value. And then the practical concordance has to be considered.
"No, religious freedom is a fundamental right, there is no obligation to disclose religious attitudes, but there is also no obligation to make them a private matter. Your attitude violates the FDGO."
Right-wing idiots are also fundamental rights holders. A meeting can only be forbidden if you have concrete information about intended crimes.
