Dark populism is always. It cannot be democratic
"These companies should have had a data protection officer before the GDPR, legal situation since 1977"
"Well, it is a watering down alone that eliminates the obligation to name a number of companies"
"With the watering down of the requirement to appoint a company data protection officer, the only suggestion for the company is to discharge the company. Data protection obligations remain, there is no competence without a BDSB. This will result in more data protection violations and fines ‚òπÔ∏è"
"According to Art. 77 GDPR you can contact the data protection authority of your place of residence, who will then contact the Irish authority. So: complaint in German"
"With such a large company, it is already violent that an employee does not know who works with personal data. Did you assert data subject rights? Then non-reaction is a violation!"

"Work on the #SDM, but also on other standardizations, continues"
I said something about this in every interview throughout the month of May
Exactly: what would you ask me? üòè
And? Where is your point Why should data protection law alone (!) Solve all digital problems? Why not use competition law and other special rights (e.g. in the financial sector) at the same time?
"Most importantly, do I have to buy back self-determination if circumstances change for me or what would the revocation look like?"
"Not necessarily, it depends on the details, besides, ‚Äúsharing data‚Äù is not the only idea of the competition guardians"
That&#39;s why I&#39;m such a fan of the cooperation between data protection authorities and competition authorities :-)
"In the balance between security and data protection, a mistake is made, possibly also to demonstrate action"
"No alternative, in fact. Why should an authority chief be able to prescribe elected MPs which laws they can pass?"
I have repeatedly referred to the positive example of France
I know :-( My children have a lot of friends with a migration background and tell me about the bad experiences when they are out with them. And some of the adult racists feel encouraged to be much more aggressive than before ...

Her second tweet (the one about cycling) was so sad
"Since you replied to me: The prosecution of criminal offenses published (!) Is not censorship, nor is the deletion of criminal content such as violent exclamations. You play down censorship"
I think that has very little to do with it
Both! At the same time! And much more!

"Therefore, 2/3 of 145 euros are missing here. In addition, the compensation payment for the flight from the previous evening, because the airport was free for take-offs again, but Eurowings had no crew ..."
You only transfer a third of the 145 euros to me because I took two other passengers with me? I gave names and explicitly stated that I paid the taxi costs alone and therefore the other two did not make an application.
"Specifically: You transfer me 197.29 euros after three and a half months. With hotel and taxi costs of 144.95 after a flight cancellation and taxi costs of 145 euros after a diverted flight, the bill looks different."
"Hello Mandy, researched and found an incoming payment. Overlooked because it&#39;s an unexpected amount and doesn&#39;t even match my additional costs, let alone compensation. Do I get anything else in writing?"
"In the background, neither @RenateKuenast nor I are talking, but the representative of Google :-P"

"Only when the British and / or Irish authorities submit their proposal for a complaint, i.e. after a hearing and an investigation (vulgar rule of law :-))"
"It&#39;s about the opposite, namely empowering users over the platforms. Please don&#39;t get upset, but only ask if something bumps you"
"In Brussels at the plenary session of the European Data Protection Board. It is about certification / accreditations, mandates for working groups to regulate the social media platforms, etc."
"It&#39;s already 14 working days, in Heiden-Berlin even 15 working days :-)"

One can complain to the #BfDI about refused IFG information from federal authorities
"True, should not happen in a hurry and I deleted. Only: With an excited message (&quot;madness&quot;) instead of a quick note, only further dissemination took place ..."
"The assertion was &quot;Exactly that was not possible with the GDPR, precisely because the federal government overshot the target in some points&quot;. Then - as the only example - the bDSB. That is not correct. And: duties remain even without a BDSB, without their own experts"
"Uh, that&#39;s neither an answer to the first nor the second question, but a third topic"
"So has the previous trend really worsened since May 24, 2018? Please source"
"That&#39;s not right, @fdp.

Do you know when the media received it?
"I cannot judge whether those who recorded the conversation lawfully did so because I do not know the people and their possible initial suspicions. The media behaved correctly, this was clearly no longer a private conversation ..."
"√† la V-Mann would be correct. Nevertheless, of course, if you have reasonable suspicion, that&#39;s part of investigative journalism. But I don&#39;t know who was the initiator"
