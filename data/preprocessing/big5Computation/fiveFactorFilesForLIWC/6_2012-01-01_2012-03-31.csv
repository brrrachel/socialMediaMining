@hildwin do you want the main committee as we requested at the beginning of the legislature? is the pm fraction opinion? you never know with you :)
do not understand why the experts should not contribute their skills to all open questions. #eidg benefited from this
"1. network committee is good, but only as a main committee with full rights, 2. #eidg has still not worked through a job"

super tuesday
@kbojens as we do it in the creative pact in the parliamentary group. but otherwise the debate is partly underground
@Opp_speaker jepp. I have read. but the article also shows how stuck everything is. and he shows no ideas on what should come.
could we have a discussion about copyright where not just one side downs the other and vice versa?
@Sandstichling in combination with the posting law is no problem nationally.
"@Sandstichling therefore: statutory minimum wage, regulation of temporary agency work etc. is currently not included with political majorities."
@ Sandstichling that is unfortunately true. but hopefully the wage increase is also a signal for other collective bargaining
good wage agreement! congratulations to verdi.
@Pausanias are you also a bvb fan?
@ Henningtillmann and you are still the clear favorite for the championship title. don&#39;t think anyone else can get you @mathiasrichel
