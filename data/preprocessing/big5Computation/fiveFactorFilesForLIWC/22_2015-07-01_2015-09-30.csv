@borispalmer opens saturday @europeangreens #greencities15  http://goo.gl/o7H7CW  - impressions from yesterday  http://goo.gl/HA34zg 
What AmCham&#39;s position on the Malmström proposal has so far not been publicly known. Do we want to bet if they will say yes?
"The AmCham is right. I said that wrong yesterday at the TTIP panel discussion. Sorry. In fact, it was the US Chamber ofCommerce."
The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) emphasizes that it has not condemned the Malmström proposal to protect investment in the TTIP framework.
"After #VWgate: Which way for Made in Germany? Reorientation indispensable, otherwise we will end up in a dead end. http://goo.gl/hQiO01"
Feckl: Europe has to fight more for its own interests. Gabriel: France should block less in the agricultural sector. - Who wins? # TTIP2015
Clear difference between French &amp; German position to TTIP! Feckl: USA are not moving. Gabriel: Neither of them do. Feckl: Europe ... # TTIP2015
The actual message of the meandering Gabriel is that he is not clearly behind Feckl&#39;s massive position. # TTIP2015
"Oh: Gabriel calls statements about how much growth # TTIP2015 would bring, &quot;Voodoo economy&quot;. BDI / DIHK / BDA &amp; EU-KOMM = Voodoo people."
After the strong Feckl Gabriel gives 1 weak picture. Talks about how to discuss instead of positioning yourself clearly. # TTIP2015
I guess being a pragmatist helps in coming up with strong arguments. Re TTIP and other issues. ;-) https://twitter.com/jonworth/status/648533631720407040 …
Feckl: European values are at stake at TTIP. - I had previously said the same thing in substance. New axis to TTIP? # TTIP2015
. @ info_man Yes. Not public.
". @ jonworth Well, if that&#39;s not what Feckl says today!"
"Feckl: &quot;If the current unbalanced situation continues, we do not rule out anything.&quot; Also no negotiation stop. # TTIP2015"
"Feckl: Unfortunately, shortly before the 11th round of negotiations, you have to draw 1 &quot;bitter&quot; interim balance. US haven&#39;t really moved yet. # TTIP2015"
"Europe must not give up its self-image and not want to sign TTIP at any price, says Feckl. # TTIP2015"
Feckl confirms what I said about transparency. Negotiators&#39; handling of transparency demands is &quot;humiliating&quot;. # TTIP2015
"Fr. Vice Trade Minister Feckl on TTIP: &quot;Where there is a lack of transparency, distrust arises.&quot; And the transparency agenda is just beginning. # TTIP2015"

@TFKrawczyk I share your opinion: Nationalism becomes the cheap coin of rhetoric here. (Although you should slow him down already :-))
Farage gives a hate speech. Says the refugee streams are inoculated with subversive ISIS militants.
Lamberts: We need to be open to our future... we need to build alliances.. we need to sustain hope.. need to respond to the emergencies..
Lamberts (Verts/ALE): We need to keep the treaty alive and show what it means. ... Stand up against dictatorship of short term profit...
Zimmer (GUE): focuses almost entirely on refugee policy. Offers Juncker support against nationalism of the member countries.

"Weber (EPP): It was not Europe that failed, but national selfishness. - Is Seehofer listening?"
Weber (EPP): On countries that only Christian. Want to take in refugees: We in Europe are not proud of Christian rights - human rights.

"Weber: &quot;You, Mr. Tsipras, love confrontation, we love the compromise.&quot; They probably gave him drugs. He has never been lying like this."

Martin Schulz breaks the rules of procedure for the ISDS vote in the EP in order to spare his social partners the difficult vote on a clear no.
"Tusk: &quot;If you want to help your friend, don&#39;t humiliate him.&quot; Also says: Dijsselbloem has just received the Greek application."
"Juncker: Earlier, at Barroso, technocrats negotiated about Greece, the political leaders negotiated in this commission."
"Tsipras promises proposals tomorrow. Quotes Sophokles: ""There are times when greatest law is justice."""
@NdKtweets Would be insane.
"Tsipras talks about ""rights of sovereign government"". I wonder why he continues 2 emphasize his legitimacy, even after referendum. #JustAct"
"Tsipras, in wrapping up: ""This debate should have happened some time ago."" ""There would've been a solution between COM & GRE, if no Troika."""
"Tsipras speaks of specifications of &quot;incredible hardness&quot;. In many countries, savings had to be made, he recognizes. But nowhere like in Greece."
"Tsipras starts badly. As &quot;mistakes of the past&quot;, he ONLY refers to the &quot;unsuccessful austerity policy&quot;. Something is missing."
"Juncker on EU refugee policy: we are not up to date, on neither side. - Now Tsipras."
"Tusk: If we don&#39;t have a solution by Sunday, everyone will lose. If you don&#39;t see that, you&#39;re naive. This week is the last deadline."

The last time there were so many photojournalists in the EP when Pope Francis visited. Always this boost for revolutionaries. ;-)
".@TheresaAFallon  Give us until Sunday to finally goof up on Greece, then we'll turn to messing up other matters. I promise. @FareedZakaria"
"At 9:45 we start next debate in EP, with Tsipras. Ultimatum which the Europ. Council set until Sunday leaves him very little wiggling room."
.@yjadot Completely without budgetary rules Europe could not be built either.

Begging for #TTIP: Negotiations should &quot;gain intensity&quot; in the second half of the year. Not a word of completion negotiations Merkel wanted.
Industrial policy - 1 secondary aspect or maybe not? Bettel has 1 sentence for it: wants to be active for space and steel. #That&#39;s all
"Said Bettel: ""Combatting tax avoidance... is a priority for Luxembourg."" Yes he did. Let's hope he'll walk the walk, not just talk the talk."
With Bettel (Lux) and Tsipras we have two premiers in the EP today. Not every day either. Limited interest in begging. pic.twitter.com/TD2KQv7Fcw

"Martin Schulz&#39;s lame defense by S&amp;D Group leader Pitella. Only a few S&amp;D MEPs clap, nobody else. Lesson!"
Sharp criticism from GRÜNEN and GUE / NGL against Martin Schulz for his provocative statements about Greece: &quot;You got lost.&quot;

My information: The proposal of Greek side is Pres. Juncker's improved last proposal with 5 points of improved changes from the Greek side.
"Purportedly, Tsipras has found the support of ALL Greek parties for a new offer 2 be made 2 the Eurogroup. That changes the dynamic. I hope."
