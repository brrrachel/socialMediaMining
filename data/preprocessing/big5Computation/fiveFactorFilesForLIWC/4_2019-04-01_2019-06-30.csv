"When it comes to climate protection, three things are important to us: The measures must avoid CO2, be economically sensible and stimulating and be socially balanced in their pollution."
&quot;The #CDU is regularly assigned the highest level of economic competence. It is therefore up to us to develop and present a concept that proves that successful climate protection is above all a topic of economic modernization.&quot; @akk today in the @BILDamSONNTAG pic.twitter.com/0cxWhbhMRE

"Diverse issues have to be reconciled: We as CDU take care of the social compatibility of the energy transition. We look at the economy and jobs. To this end, we want to integrate climate policy goals into our economic and social policies."
"The fight against climate change is also our central concern. The CDU stands by the climate protection agreement of Paris and the goals set there. We pursue these goals with reason and judgment, because there is no black or white for us in climate and environmental policy."
"We as CDU rely on innovation, technology-based solutions and incentives instead of bans. We rely on research and development to compensate for the loss of coal electricity with new technologies."
"The fight against climate change is and remains our central concern. Without Germany &amp; Europe, climate protection and, above all, the Paris climate agreement would not have been initiated. Our goal is still to combine economic growth and environmental protection."

@akk: We have to get better on social media. We have to do better when it comes to real dialogue and not one-sided #communication.
We will work out our own answers based on our values and beliefs. The federal executive committee will debate the &quot;future of mobility&quot; and take a decision.
. @ akk: We will continue the ongoing discussion on the “future of mobility” and look for political competition with other political parties.

"We have to say specifically where it will be relieved. Otherwise, the tax affects those who are already heavily burdened anyway. Take a look at France: there the higher energy prices triggered the &quot;yellow vest&quot; protest.

The commuter who only gets to work with his car will need the car in the future. A general debate that the introduction of an additional CO2 tax also has to relieve people is of no use to commuters.
"Finally, we would also run the risk of not achieving our goals in this way. Before we decide on an additional burden for people, we have to clarify how we want to relieve them again so that the bottom line does not result in more stress."
"But there must be a few clarities. We cannot just happily pass a CO2 tax without knowing what impact it will have and what kind of misregistration could be involved, for example social misregistration."
"Volker Bouffier today @faznet on the #CO2 tax: We are all clear in the #CDU and beyond that we want to achieve the climate targets. The exciting question now is, how do we get there? No one bans thinking. [Thread]"
