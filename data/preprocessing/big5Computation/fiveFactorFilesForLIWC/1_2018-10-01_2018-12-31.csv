"Yes, but we have already halved unemployment!"
We have to do more and become better in climate protection! This is my reaction to the # COP24 in Katowice https://twitter.com/SRaktuell/status/1074337121132036096…
Unemployment in Germany is falling more and more: Now below 5% for the first time !!! On the road to full employment!

"2018 was a good year for many in Germany, but things have turned bad around the world. #climate #freedom #security. We in politics were too busy with ourselves for too long. We have to change that. Happy 2019 to you all!"
I am happy for everyone who had a good Christmas. But we should also think of those who are less well or poor today. Here with us and everywhere in the 🌍. Christmas is a party for EVERYONE!
"Today, coal mining in Germany is finally coming to an end. We owe an infinite amount to generations of miners: warmth, prosperity, security. Many have lost lives or health. Thank you!"

For sure? Why do you think that?
The victims of #Pittsburgh are the depressing evidence that anti-Semitism lives and still kills. We can never accept that: It doesn&#39;t matter where and by whom it happens.
"Hessen is about the ability of politics to act. Populism and demagogy must not win. Your vote for Volker Bouffier is a strong signal for democracy, measure &amp; middle!"
"Congratulations, dear Austria, for the #National holiday! You are doing a good EU Council Presidency! That&#39;s important, right now, with all the crises all around! https://twitter.com/sebastiankurz/status/1055702735239155712…"
Certainly.
"Sometimes friendships, or business, also develop"
Wow! Then it was worth it for decades!
I want jobs AND climate protection. Therefore the steel industry in Germany and Europe must have a future. #Stahlgipfel
"Volker Bouffier is one of the best prime ministers we have ever had: down-to-earth, off-road, measured &amp; middle, open &amp; humane. Good for Hessen &amp; Germany."
👍✌️

Good luck all of you!
Good luck all of you!
"So, I&#39;ve been cycling through Berlin again and again for 19 years, I often sit in “dirty slingshots” (not for pleasure) and still talk about climate protection because the survival of billions of people is at stake! https://twitter.com/_donalphonso/status/1074254456462675968…"
The law passed today by the cabinet to speed up the expansion of the power grid is an important breakthrough for the success of the energy transition! https://twitter.com/BMWi_Bund/status/1072808381843410944…
Ludwig Erhard forever !!!! https://twitter.com/fabkienbaum/status/1072453132725248001…
The most important aspect is the independence from Russia. And that means LNG-infrastructure in Germany. I go for that! https://twitter.com/ManfredWeber/status/1070685599483469824 …

"Congratulations, dear @_A_K_K_ to your great success! Thanks also to @_FriedrichMerz and @jensspahn for fair competition. We all won today: Annegret, the CDU and our country!"
The many years that Angela Merkel was and is Chancellor and CDU Chancellor are among the best that our country has ever experienced. A big thank you for that! And on to new shores! 👍✌️
"Ludwig Erhard was the founder of the social market economy and a great minister of economics for 14 years. However, his chancellorship was short."
"Also UK, China, Japan, Indonesia, India & many others! :-)"
I who else! 😎👍
"Dear UK, dear British friends! Brexit is the final proof against that odd thesis of the EU superstate: Every member state may freely leave the union at any time. It’s upon the citizens & the Parlaments. We will badly miss you. We love you."
. @ Markus_Soeder is right: Neither our voters nor our members want us to constantly fight the battles of the past! https://twitter.com/SZ_Politik/status/1066608655167119361…
"Among the e-cars, I would not know of any similar appeal! Except for the e-Porsche, of course, but that&#39;s almost a contradictio in objecto! 😎"
Does anyone know outside? Did you tell people that? And why not?
"Great success for Germany, its economy and all of us: the most competitive country in the world after the USA and Singapore (according to the World Economic Forum). Congratulations! 👍"

"The coalition agreement states that no weapons will be delivered to states directly involved in the war in Yemen, with the exception of acts of legitimate expectations! In this respect, his statement makes sense"
People’s vote marche is the most impressive and deeply moving support for Europe I‘ve ever seen. Millions across Europe feel with you! Thx so much!!! Danke! Merci!

You&#39;re in a good mood this morning! 😎
Whenever an integrated single market will be split again this will lead to an Lose/Lose situatian on both sides. We can soften the impact but will never prevent it completely. https://twitter.com/JeremyCliffe/status/1062683363302092800 …
I fully agree with this: The BMWi has been working on it for some time and with high pressure. #Batteries made in Germany!
"9 million dead, happiness &amp; prosperity all over Europe pulverized in World War I. But only after WW2 did we finally get it: EU is the best thing that ever happened to us! Let&#39;s stand for it!"
What you think you know ... Just google &quot;Altmaier Bismarck&quot; 😎
"The problem with young democracy in the empire was that the Reichstag was not allowed to determine the chancellor. In addition, foreign policy fell into the peaogative of the executive."
Bewitched! 😎
"Strong speech by our Federal President FW Steinmeier in the Bundestag on November 9, 1918: combative, profound, stirring. Groundbreaking. Thank you."
"Congratulations Germany: Today, 100 years ago, we became a democracy and a republic. The great work then failed due to intolerance, violence, reaction &amp; ideology. This must never be repeated! #Our mission"
The last time I mentioned the sanctions part was in Moscow in a speech. Yesterday I made it clear that Germany will continue to insist on securing gastransit ukraine.
"Dear Mr. Röpcke, I also say that the sanctions that have been decided will continue to apply until the Ukraine conflict is resolved, but I do not know anyone who wants to end any economic exchange with Russia."
"Congratulations, dear @ManfredWeber! With you at the top, Europe, Germany, Bavaria and we all win! Respect for @alexstubb"
The handbag is the trouser pocket enemy! :-)
