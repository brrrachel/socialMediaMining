"@cducsubt A currency would be good for this, which could take into account the different needs of the individual economies."
"@RegSprecher How high is the statistics adjusted for retraining, Hartz IV, etc.?"
@peersteinbrueck Exactly. And the pressure to cut costs is a direct consequence of the euro being too strong and too cheap for the southern countries.
