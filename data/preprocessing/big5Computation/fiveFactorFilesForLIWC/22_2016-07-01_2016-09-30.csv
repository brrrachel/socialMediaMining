Ayrault quotes from the declaration of founding the Weimar Triangle: &quot;Europe is at 1 historic turning point.&quot; Says: &quot;A timeless sentence.&quot; ;-)
Fr. AMin Ayrault speaks in German. Steinmeier calls you and Waszczykowski calls her. Calls for EU successes not to be ignored. Applause.
"Waszczykowski&#39;s 3 priorities were: security policy, especially in NATO; Ostpolitik; &quot;Pragmat.&quot; European policy. Deutl. Difference to Steinmeier."
Waszczykowski advertises &quot;hard&quot; migration policy in the World Hall. &quot;Protects&quot; Merkel by replacing her Europ. Commission sharply criticized.
Waszczykowski names EU as a German-Polish field. Additional work: &quot;Sober&quot; migration policy. Criticizes &quot;double standards&quot; in Migrat.-politics.
Waszczykowski: Poland wants to cooperate with Germany to build trust between European Countries to restore. Focus: Eastern neighborhood.
Waszczykowski: Territorial aggression back in Europe since 2014. OSCE: lost credibility. Nato Warsaw Summit good compromise.
"AMin Waszczykowski praises Genscher&#39;s &quot;Responsibility Policy&quot; in the Weltsaal, in contrast to &quot;Power Policy&quot;. Call the EU &quot;divided again today&quot;."
"Steinmeier: The question is not whether Germany is the central council of Europe, but whether we create a common center with partners. - Good."
"Steinmeier: &quot;Europe can be a magnet, individual European countries just iron shavings.&quot;"
Steinmeier names three main areas of German foreign policy: crisis management; long-term work on the international. Order; united strong EU.
Steinmeier describes the international situation in a picture by Robert #Musil: #Magnetism that aligned the iron shavings no longer works. Chaos.
