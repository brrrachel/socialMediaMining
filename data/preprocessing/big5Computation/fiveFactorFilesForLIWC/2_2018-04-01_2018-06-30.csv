"All your mass mailing - people, that&#39;s not proof of work, I really get it that way. And in a democracy, there is good reason to disagree. The argument counts for me, not the most striking action https://twitter.com/campact/status/986261458609721344‚Ä¶"

"NGO competition, who can protest louder #Glyphosat #Neonics. Environmental aid, Campact etc. - who surpasses the quantity of mass emails / tweets? In the meantime I work + make important decisions, not because of activist actions, but from factual establish"
Since DUH calls to protest + is the only one who does not know that I have long since spoken out in favor of a ban #Neonics. Main actionism pic.twitter.com/QQhcNqz5is
I am pleased that your spokesman has also made it clear that there are European law hurdles for a complete ban. Hence our mutually agreed reduction strategy. Everyone who tries to drive a wedge between the ministries is not well informed :-) https://twitter.com/svenjaschulze68/status/985813583740227584‚Ä¶

"Everyone who sends me mass tweets a hundred times (!), Word for word: The consequence is that I can&#39;t read anything about it. To all NGOs: The success of your request does not grow proportionally with the quantity of the mailings. The best thing is a (!) Mail to the office. We can do it cognitively :-)"

"#Nitrate #EUGH Today&#39;s judgment, which refers to an old, no longer existing fertilizer regulation, is not surprising. Because there were reasons why the Federal Ministry revised and tightened the fertilizer regulation last year. The judgment does not refer to this"
