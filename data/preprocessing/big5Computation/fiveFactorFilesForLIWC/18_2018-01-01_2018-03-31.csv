The stupid excuses of the perpetrators are one thing - authorities that immediately rule out a racist background are the real problem. #Zinnowitz https://twitter.com/er_mv/status/960478550934552576…
The fact that the investigation was not successful earlier could be due to the fact that secret service agents were active in the camaraderie. We know the principle of source protection from law enforcement from the #NSU. https://www.lotta-magazin.de/ausgabe/66/nicht-aufkl-rung-mit-vielen-fragen… 3/3

"The subgroup of the Nazi hool network &quot;Berserker&quot;, which was excavated in the Lahn-Dill district of Hesse, was well networked and one example among many for an increased militancy and increasing armament of the right-wing scene: http://m.fr.de/rhein-main/ crime / raid-near-dillenburg-rights-hooligans-under-suspected-a-1435127…"
We can send it to you. Please via DM times email address.
List of # NeoNazi properties known to the federal government is incomplete; the criteria of capturing are unclear. Nevertheless: 136 known right-wing houses are 136 places of networking and planning from the right rock concert to the # right terror cell. http://m.haz.de/Nachrichten/Politik/Deutschland-Welt/136-Immobilien-unter-Kontrolle-von-Neonazis…
"@nsuwatch_nrw Now it is to be hoped that the court will not be spared by the #VS and that the questions about accomplices and comrades-in-arms, whether spies or not, will be brought to the evidence.

What did German authorities know about jihadist networks BEFORE &amp; AFTER the Breitscheidplatz attack? Our question for #Examination Board.
Our criticism remains just as correct that the files on the attack and arson attack were not made available to the # NSU committees of inquiry. And right what @rettirp says about the need for real parliamentary education in MV. @Nordkurier https://twitter.com/rettirp/status/953370223591284737…
If the machinations of the #VS in Brandenburg and the difficulties in clarifying the role of the spy #Szczepanski in the # NSU complex are the subject. Could the Augias stable be completely cleaned out?

It is time for a regular # NSU investigation committee in # Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. @GBA_b_BGH and @bka apparently were not interested in previous Nazi attacks on the snack bar of the later murder victim Mehmet Turgut. http://www.ostsee-zeitung.de/Mecklenburg/Rostock/Raetsel-NSU-Mehr-Nazi-Attacken-auf-Turgut…
Did the #VS sabotage the judiciary in the case of Carsten #Szczepanski&#39;s informer? It would not be the first time. But this was about attempted murder. A good example of why there can be no final line in the # NSU scandal and that independent clarification remains necessary. https://twitter.com/nsu_watch_brb/status/952072349175681024…
