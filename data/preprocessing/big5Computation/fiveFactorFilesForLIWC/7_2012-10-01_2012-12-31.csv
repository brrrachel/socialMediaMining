Succession in Rhineland-Palatinate is superbly regulated with Roger Lewenz as party leader and especially with the great Malu Dreyer as MP!
"With Kurt Beck, a great social democrat leaves the stage, to whom the SPD owes a lot and to whom I have been associated for a long time!"
"@danielasgedanke @christiansoeder intellectually he could create the 140 characters: &quot;Rösler goofy, Kubicki knows everything better&quot; - fits easily!"
The first two women of the North SPD nominated for the Bundestag. Congratulations to Birgit Malecha-Nissen (PLÖ / NMS) + Karin Thissen (ST)!
Also the hard-won 0: 0 of the HSV in Freiburg followed.

@Elke_Ferner good evening!
140 years of SPD in Kellinghusen. Proud anniversary!
"@DoroBaer it would be worth trying, wouldn't it?..."
@DoroBaer too bad that I can not hear that; -}
"If the right choice was made, Kubicki was quickly elected out of the government and the FDP almost halved - real democracy has something ..."
That is really true !! Complete agreement!! “@DoroBaer: The @manomama is just cool! http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/peer-und-die-frauen-sie-ehmen-doch-nicht-jeden/7366542.html… ”

Long day today with numerous appointments.
"In the end, the majority of the United States defended the hard right, despite all the criticism of this and that much renewal power!"
What Twitter is supposed to do: Break up the grand coalition and let Kubicki play government for 2.5 years without success - pretty.
Political passion is sometimes in short supply in Germany - if that is paired with reason it is admirable!
This is also a good day for world politics - luckily the Tea Party has no access to the politics of the USA!
The emotionality and inspiration that comes across is always amazing.
The supposed coalition coup was just a nocturnal cow (trade). Unfortunately not a quality product but only political rotten meat.
"The black and yellow pension concept is a bad joke even as old-age alms, refusing to do good work is the main problem!"
Stadtwerke Bochum provide a sad example of how apparently without a substance 3 day long media sow is driven through the village - a prankster ...
"Seehofer: 2 + 2 = 5.Rösler: Not right. 2 + 2 = 3. Merkel ensures breakthrough, coalition decides: 2 + 2 = 8. Excellent! This is what the real upswing looks like!"
"Morning talk: Who was the best at the weekend: Markus Lanz, HSV against Bayern or Merkel &amp; Rösler &amp; Seehofer? Negative selection order is correct!"
@manomama instead they smoked something ...; -}
How stupid do the black and yellow coalition leaders actually think the population is? Recipe: Rösler&#39;s remaining term extended + audience sedated!
@manomama the probability of winning corresponds to the millionaire&#39;s lottery!
The 17th restart of this black and yellow disaster combo sounds shrill in the ears and costs billions-expensive practice fee for Rösler &amp; Co.!
FDP-Kubicki demands &quot;white knight&quot; as investor for HSH Nordbank. Don&#39;t talk-act! White Knight would be a good new role for WK; -}
Ridiculous coalition summit brings expected nonsense deal: Weak FDP says yes to CSU daycare bonus nonsense for practice fees!
Music tip: Reinhard Mey &quot;The time of the juggler is over&quot;. I wish everyone a nice start to the week!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Office appointments in Kiel, school visits in Neumünster and constituency rounds in Felde are on the program today."
@DoroBaer that&#39;s crazy! Totally wrong!
@knuddellove get well soon; -}
"To be governed by Merkel &amp; Rösler &amp; Ramsauer is somehow not up to date, maybe also an expression of representative democracy ...?"
This will celebrate the black and yellow Berlin disaster combo itself as great proof of the ability to act and govern ... oh dear ....
"Betting: Tonight, the weak FDP is dealing with the sensible abolition of the practice fee against the feeble-minded daycare premium from the CSU."
@RasmusAndresen okay!
5.We should vote on the complete disclosure of additional income in the Bundestag and Landtag - then black and yellow Pharisees will pinch!
3.PS has disclosed and taxed income 4. Hypocritical are Union &amp; FDP critics who reject transparency in euros and cents!
On the Steinbrück debate: 1. Additional income in the amount is always in need of explanation for ordinary people 2. PS speaks no one for money after the mouth
@RasmusAndresen very simple: for defensive democracy!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Beautiful autumn morning. Music tip: Mark Knopfler &quot;Piper to the end&quot;. Happy Sunday everyone!

Good morning from Bordesholm. Today again parliamentary groups with important topics and in the evening Christmas party of the national executive.
"Have you heard that the rule of law applies to everyone? Fortunately for Fitschen, Bouffier answered the phone - who knows what would have ended up in the mailbox!"
Deutsche Bank boss Fitschen complains to Hessens MP Bouffier about action by the public prosecutor - without his prior permission!

"Cool! “@Zeitonline: At http://www.bayernspd.de, the call from #CSU to #ZDF is humorous: (leo) pic.twitter.com/rnN3JpTl”"
"Given the position of this party, this is also a way! “@ N24_de # FDP man Martin Lindner reaches for the Joint # N24 #News http://l.n24.de/TI48ht”"
"The one with the call was the strepp, behind it is the real fool. &quot;Tell the TODAY guys what is the matter about the Bavarian election!&quot;"
Dear CSU: With the second one ..... it is better to telephone ... (not) .....; -}
"People, the CSU is the victim of this - the press spokesman had to ask ruefully for his release because he cheated Seehofer on behalf of the SPD!"
"Hello, how likely is it that the CSU has pressured ARD &amp; ZDF press officers without assignment, at least approval or knowledge of the leadership?"
The CSU hut is on fire - press spokesman is sacrificed so that Dobrindt + Seehofer can give the outraged - we would never do that!
@Steonato a social democratic sleeper in the CSU headquarters?
"@davidwelsch aha, now the Lauenburg socialists are already wulffing if Peter Eichstädt knew ....; -}"
Hey CSU: How about a new edition of Bismarck&#39;s law against social democracy&#39;s endangered endeavors? Saves calls to ARD &amp; ZDF.
Thank you Mr. Strepp! You just wanted to help the SPD. Sozis do not have false hopes.
@manomama really caustic - keep your fingers crossed that this will stop soon - nobody can stop you anyway! If you are too strong - they are too weak; -}
@DoroBaer but when I turned to your CSU so lovingly yesterday and today ...; -}
@ThomasOppermann I think we should stay hard with full transparency - they threw stones out of the glass house - no leaning in!
"Instead of problematic election gifts such as lowering pension contributions, the CDU &amp; FDP should prefer to support pensions that secure their livelihood!"
Lowering the pension contribution rate allegedly to relieve the burden on employees - in reality irresponsible - would be better!
@DorotheedeNeve ;-}
@muehlenwind Bingo-That&#39;s right!
Or was it the Hape Kerkeling?
Doesn&#39;t taste like anything and supposedly has zero (indebtedness) calories - but hits the stomach powerfully!
Freedom of the press made in Bavaria: &quot;You can broadcast everything that the CSU uses and likes&quot; - understood?
"Take a pinch of practice fee, add 2 spoons of keep-away bonus, season it with a little &quot;life-long-term pension alms&quot; black and yellow + nasty!"
"Furthermore, nobody on this floor has material problems waiting for this relatively short waiting period. But sometimes appearances are enough."
This really has nothing to do with the natural freedom of mandate for all professional groups - it&#39;s only about the TOP level!
First lesson of the new day: Merkel-perfect Democrats are everywhere ...; -}
Strauß once arrested unpopular journalists at SPIEGEL affair - there is Seehofer &amp; Co. still room for improvement ....
"If this continues, people will still get the idea that parties other than the CSU may be elected in Bavaria - where do we get there?"
"But it&#39;s also outrageous: ZDF actually wanted to report on Bavarian social partners at prime time, the State Party doesn&#39;t like that at all!"
CSU begs for opposition role: There is no other way to interpret a brazen attempt to influence the media.
Music tip: John Lennon &quot;Imagine&quot;. Happy imaginative Wednesday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Office appointments in Kiel today. Yesterday annual reception of the state press conference with ducks for greens, pirates + deJager."
There only helps: finally deselect! “@SZ_TopNews: Call ZDF: CSU wanted to prevent report on SPD party conference http://sz.de/1.1504207 (bot)”
"Incidentally, @iSchack, as a member of parliament, has had corresponding reporting obligations to the state parliament president for years."
@iSchack there are none!
The whole lacrimal poetry about liberal professions + professional politicians from the public service is actually supposed to hide real conditions
"In this context, it is particularly easy to understand who refuses the transparency of additional income and why. We&#39;ll follow up hard!"
Anyone who defaces anti-public welfare positions with no makeup against 15 other countries cannot be argued with.

"(2) wait 2-3 years on the other side, this avoids appearances of conflicts of interest or impressions. Where is the problem?"

Good morning from Bordesholm. During the day the parliamentary groups and in the evening to the EKD synod in Timmendorfer Strand.
Day-care-keep-away premium is thus labeled as &quot;family political freedom of choice&quot;!
"Now all cards should be on the table in terms of secondary earnings! CDU &amp; FDP only wanted something to stick to Peer Steinbrück, nothing more."
"I asked for a review clause to ensure that good work is followed by a good pension-minimum wages, equal wages for women-lots to do!"
"FOCUSonline reports with reference to Tagesspiegel interview (Monday edition) that I would not have questioned pension level 43%, text says opposite!"

"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today back to Berlin, where a series of appointments is waiting for me."
@ Sepp49 I don&#39;t think so - but disclose and tax everything so that voters can form a judgment.
The CDU &amp; FDP in particular have no interest in disclosing who pays what for what! You have to go through - citizens are not stupid!
CDU &amp; FDP: Now you have to be brave. You have opened the wrong cage door for sideline activities: Behind it is not a hamster but a panther!

"@danielas thought as please? The anti-Danish posters in the election campaign were probably from the CDU, right? That was bad style, not criticism of it."
Schwarzgelb stood for party politicization of minority politics and politics against Danish neighbors: SPD / Greens &amp; SSW for good neighborhood!
So it goes: MP Albig&#39;s visit to Copenhagen shows that the SPD / Greens &amp; SSW relations between SH and Denmark have been corrected!

@Roter_Schlumpf that is what you get when you take statements here seriously and literally; -} but if that should be pure nihilism - also okay!
@tauss is also my opinion - I&#39;m not the mouthpiece for others!
@tauss there are unfortunately many examples of unfree systems - also in German history!
"@tauss gladly for repetition: Democracy demands clear, also strict, transparency rules. Total &quot;transparency&quot; easily becomes totalitarian."
@shoaportal @roter_schlumpf @kotzfrosch there are also intellectual minimum standards for Twitter debates - otherwise without me.
"@shoaportal @roter_schlumpf @kotzfrosch that&#39;s grotesque: you follow voluntarily, right? Nobody is forced."
@tatzenpirat @roter_schlumpf virtual beating around without arguments is pretty boring. Recommend to try out thinking function.
"@Roter_Schlumpf @kotzfrosch long live the prejudice. Who loves such clichés, saves the thought effort!"
@OekoErnst because the basic value of freedom is de facto abolished.
"In order not to be misunderstood: Public control of possible dependencies is necessary, but some things are a private matter (e.g. who you donate to)."
"This is precisely what we are arguing about in SH with pirates - because they strictly reject any form of confidential conversation, for example to find consensus."
"Again: yes to clear and strict rules, especially for public offices - but no to total exploration without space for confidentiality!"
Absolute transparency is rather totalitarian and in democracy it is neither desirable nor feasible - the largest possible according to clear rules!
@ethereal1ty merci!
Citizens need to know from whom politicians get what for what - that is part of transparent democracy! FDP reasoning is unbelievable!
"I think it&#39;s good that PS wants to disclose everything, but its critics should follow the example and no longer block stricter rules!"
"You really do not have to share every view of Peer Steinbrück, but he does not speak for money according to the mouth + observes applicable rules."

"In the Kiel OB election, Susanne Gaschke is in the final sprint of the last 14 days. The state capital must remain red!"
