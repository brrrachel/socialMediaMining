"The application is about student jobs / holiday jobs, not employment. We want schoolchildren to be able to earn up to ‚Ç¨ 1,500 a year # HartzIV-credit-free in order to fulfill their own wishes. TL"
"... and also the request that pupils should be allowed to earn more, even if their parents receive social benefits, came from us: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/100/1910019.pdf .... TL"

That depends on the election programs for which the (democratic) parties stand. It is not yet possible to say what they will look like. We would not refuse talks after a next federal election. TL

We would be a co-organizer of an exclusively black and green policy that would be no different from what GroKo does today. We did not want and do not want that. TL
"We are not a big, but a small election winner. Third force in the EU # parliament, votes doubled in Germany and #Bremen re-entry with design options. But tomorrow we have to work to make even better use of our potential. CL # EUWahl2019"
"#Europe for me is the guarantee of freedom, values, lifestyle and prosperity in a changing world. So that it stays that way, we have to shake off the crippling GroKo in # Brussels and finally bring more speed. Go vote today! CL # EuropeanElections2019 # GehtWahlen"
Exactly üòâ TL
Would be something ?! ;) TL
Right: The FDP has chosen the hard way in the federal government. We wanted and want to be measured by what we said before the election - and there was not enough common ground with black and green. TL
Thank you very much! TL
"The #Grundgesetz is a bulwark against all forms of collectivism - against the idea of a supposed community, but also against socialist leveling. The focus is on the individual - and has been for 70 years now. We can be proud of that. CL pic.twitter.com/pdN1rdmp8k"
"Dear @CSU, we are independent! In the case of ‚ÄúJamaica‚Äù it was the CSU that would have loved to fall in the direction of the Greens in the event of a debt union, a planned climate and even migration. We don&#39;t. Since content matters, the question of a left-wing alliance does not arise at all. CL"
We have been saying for a long time ... TL
Please tell the GroKo. We are clear there. TL

"Not only registered, but also criticized. Press freedom in Hungary is under massive and substantial pressure, so criticizing both is everything, but not hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is more likely to relativize one with the other. It&#39;s far from us. TL"

"This tweet is definitely not to be seen as support for Mr. Orb√°n, on the contrary. Anyone who limits press freedom in his country knows us against himself! For you to clarify: We believe that Mr. Weber should have made that very clear! TL"
"Orb√°n has now withdrawn support from the Union candidate, @ManfredWeber, publicly and in the final sprint of the #European election2019 as President of the Commission. It is interesting to see who resigns support to whom - if Orb√°n acts more consistently than Weber, that speaks volumes. CL"
