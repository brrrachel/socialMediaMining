@PeterRoelofs you can learn more about my campaign and our manifesto at  http://www.martin-Schulz.eu  or  http://www.pes.eu 
The German experience shows that the participation of workers in the strategic choices of a company strengthens capital and work
My priority is securing a better future. I don't accept that we are the richest continent and our young people must emigrate to find work.
The quality of products & services is not always the same in the world. Italy has huge potential & must proudly show its value to the world.
Small biz faces tough competition from countries with no worker rights. I will defend our biz & never lower standards to enter our market.
The wine industry is part of Italy's heritage.My reform plans will reduce EU interference when it can be better regulated at national level.
