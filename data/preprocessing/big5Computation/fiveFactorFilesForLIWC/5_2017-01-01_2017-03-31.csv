If it works. Aggregating records is also a nice way
That&#39;s exactly how I did it
"Anonymization is not easy and is hardly feasible with some data. But interesting approaches such as noise, aggregation etc."
No data protection is required for non-personal data. Your reverse conclusion &quot;phase-out model&quot; is simply wrong
#Factscheck NRW has record investments in schools and infrastructure
"Because dilapidated schools and bridges are also new debts, namely lack of entertainment."
Have a panel discussion with you on the subject. When? Where?
#Facts check means for road and bridge renovation now significantly higher than in 2010
@DS_Stiftung @handelsblatt_de Aua! Anonymization does not occur because the VO only regulates personal data
Government of R√ºttgers / @ ArminLaschet 2010 ‚Ç¨ 6.6 billion new debt. Government @HanneloreKraft 2016 ‚Ç¨ 217 million surplus #wirkoennenNRW #NRW

Merkel &amp; Co argue: Differentiate sensitive and insensitive data. Linking &quot;insensitive&quot; data allows conclusions to be drawn

"Quote correctly. I wrote that photo clippings on 20 people are not evidence of 10,000 minds"
"I know, colleague. But they were dozens of tweets"
On my timeline for the past three hours
"The topic was that you cannot call 10,000 demonstrators terrorists by showing a photo with 20 flags"
"If a flag is forbidden, one may not be shown. Any number, if not prohibited"
"The reactions of some followers speak volumes. One is immediately dubbed &quot;terror lover&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot; etc. Undemocratic &amp; authoritarian"
"Incidentally, it was a self-attempt to contradict an AKP activist (here parliamentarian) [CO T]"
can you argue without offending?
"again: I reject her sentence of 10,000 people because 20 carry a flag that they don&#39;t like"
"Which, incidentally, I don&#39;t do and never did. But in their zeal are all terrorists who are not 100% with you"
"You clairvoyant, you. Seriously, how do you get this outrageous claim? Because I have a different opinion? @Myeneroglu"
"Dangerously undemocratic: because I do not share your opinion, I am directly a terrorist supporter @myeneroglu @Volker_Beck"
No circular reasoning please. They claim that the demo is solely for the PKK and have so far failed to provide evidence
"10,000 protesters and they show me twenty flags? Not very convincing"
