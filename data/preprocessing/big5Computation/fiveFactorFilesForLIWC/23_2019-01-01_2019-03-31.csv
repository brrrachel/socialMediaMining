Do that. Would just like to know which alleged historical position (which assumes that someone is not thinking or not incorporating new knowledge) you would like to tackle and who exactly? Not that you end up with the named deficit yourself? ü§î
To 2) what is subjective about the #climate crisis ?! To 1) then it is good. Especially since science should not be confused with putting it into practice. There are different interests and agreements to be observed. ü§ó
"1) there is no 100% agreement regarding genetic engineering in &quot;science&quot;. 2) you don&#39;t need science anymore, just go outside."
A little confused. Put back + complaint procedure / clearing house are necessary o does the TAZ seriously want to represent that the way to the court is sufficient !? Absurd. Because you have to advance costs and wait a long time. Our proposal proposes necessary rules. @The green
