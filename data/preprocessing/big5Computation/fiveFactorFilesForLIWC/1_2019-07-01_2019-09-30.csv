It is exactly like that! https://twitter.com/tj_tweets/status/1172774759928647680‚Ä¶
"I have proposed to limit the maximum amount of the favorable bonds to, for example, 2,500 euros per person. This helps many little savers. If they are ‚Äúrich‚Äù from the perspective of the SPD, I am no longer surprised by the poor election results! https://twitter.com/spdbt/status/1172467036930420736‚Ä¶"
"I worked with @PhilipHammondUK in different functions over many years. He was always defending his country‚Äôs national interest, pressing on us to concede more than we initially intended. When he joined cross-party efforts against no-deal Brexit he did it, again, in the interest https://twitter.com/PhilipHammondUK/status/1177836101932867584¬†‚Ä¶"
Nobody would even think of financing the construction of wind turbines that are necessary for climate protection through government debt with negative interest rates ... The climate bond gives citizens the opportunity to invest in climate protection without losing their capital. https://twitter.com/FlorianGathmann/status/1171355418536370176‚Ä¶
"The introduction, reacquisition or increase of substance taxes, such as wealth tax, would be wrong in terms of regulatory policy, would unsettle many medium-sized companies, endanger growth and jobs. We should instead improve the framework for investments! https://twitter.com/OlafScholz/status/1176829634136223747‚Ä¶"
"Indeed, we need both: the open discourse, in which the argument counts and not the hierarchy, and then the responsible decision, which, like the decision-makers, must again face criticism. #Popperkultur üòéüëç https://twitter.com/PatrickBernau/status/1169894987464507397‚Ä¶"
"I&#39;m really looking forward to @AnneWillTalk tonight. Even if the views should be 4: 1, I can take it and look forward to a factual &amp; fair debate! Climate protection concerns us all, no matter which party we are!"
"Before 2017, B√ºrgerenergie won around 90% of the tenders, but almost nothing was implemented. At the request of the wind energy industry, we asked for permits again. Problem in both cases: There are too few approved locations. This is certainly not due to the BMWi! https://twitter.com/VQuaschning/status/1173504825436364800‚Ä¶"
"I&#39;ve already started: In the past few months I&#39;ve been to Vietnam, Indonesia, 2 x Japan, 2 x China. With business delegation and all the trimmings. And FDP MdB&#39;s. Next time I&#39;ll take the @c_lindner with me too! https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/1169851705330024448‚Ä¶"
"Unfortunately wrong: With special tenders even more is advertised, but apparently there is a lack of suitable locations. Because the approval process takes longer and longer. But they are not decided by the federal government. Therefore the wind summit with all involved https://twitter.com/VQuaschning/status/1166664436331024384‚Ä¶"
"The result in Saxony is a great success for Michael Kretschmer and the CDU. The AfD is very strong, but its trees don&#39;t grow in the sky. In Brandenburg respect for Info Senftleben and all committed members!"
"So it is: It is high time that SPD property tax comes back into the moth box. And that the envy debate on the solos is over - it belongs away, step by step for everyone! https://twitter.com/GFelbermayr/status/1168194433017360385‚Ä¶"
You are correct! I always write things like that myself
"Dear Ruprecht, There is now a retweeted tweet from Altenbockum with a link without any closets! :-)"
"Thank you. It is an attempt to overcome speechlessness between politics, intellectuals and the bourgeoisie. Without adulation. By taking it seriously and talking. https://twitter.com/altenbockum/status/1167042203455242242‚Ä¶"
Thanks for exciting discussions! Gladly again! https://twitter.com/digitalinnrw/status/1167127449563488257‚Ä¶

"Dear @ e4Motion, I remember: It was a rooftop interview! at that time we didn&#39;t have 20% renewables &amp; the costs exploded, today we have 44% renewable energy &amp; hardly any increase in costs. For this I have been working as a minister for 7 years. We shut down nuclear power plants &amp; coal-fired power plants!"
Both are regulated in a law. Lignite is inserted during the legislative process
"Thank you! It was on vacation and I tried not to cover the differences, but to think things together, even across ditches. We have to talk to each other: citizens, intellectuals, journalists and politicians. https://twitter.com/FlorianGathmann/status/1167123618377150466‚Ä¶"
Read my article!
"We need a vital, strong middle class in Germany! Thank you dear @faznet for letting me present my thoughts for a CIVIL MODERNITY on a whole page in the printed sheet today!"
Good news from Italy!
"I do not know who you are referring to, for me the soli is clearly NOT a wealth tax and should be gradually abolished. Without any compensation. I have said that enough times and I will pass it on."
"The next amendment will not completely abolish it, but the requirements will be clarified and tightened."
I have made! After the Citizens&#39; Dialogue I discuss with the Greenpeace people about climate and CO2
"Dear @greenpeace_de, welcome to # TdoT2019 in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. Thanks for the nice photo on the banner! Climate protection moves everyone. It is therefore good that we decided to phase out coal. Now it&#39;s all about CO2. https://twitter.com/greenpeace_de/status/1162990724100608001‚Ä¶"
"It&#39;s not the &quot;big deal&quot; yet, but it&#39;s an important pragmatic step away from trade war! https://twitter.com/GFelbermayr/status/1157384801630019584‚Ä¶"
"Hi, the federal government is not on vacation, we are working on CO2 pricing. Also on the coal phase-out and structural strengthening law. From September the decisions in government and parliament. All those who have not demonstrated today: happy holidays!"
Congratulations to @akk and @vonderleyen! We make history: in Brussels &amp; Berlin!
With this speech @vonderleyen has earned a broad cross-party vote as President of the Commission: AS A CLEAR SIGNAL that we stand and fight for our EUROPE!
Werner M√ºller is dead. From 1998-2002 he was a widely respected Minister of Economic Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany. He has served our country until the very end. With him we lose a great personality. We bow with respect and gratitude
All the very best! I was there last time and prepared everything for you! :-)
