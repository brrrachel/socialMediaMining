"Nobody ever said that German private full-service channels have a larger network of journalists. At the same time it should be remembered that 24h news channels = private invention (CNN, n24, ntv, etc.). Monopoly of opinion is also not possible with 1 station because √ñRR is plural. Regards, NB"
This is exactly why these control bodies need to be reformed so that they exercise effective control over public service broadcasters. The directors will not propose and implement serious structural reform.
"That is the problem of distance from the state, you have to talk about it. But: All public-law control bodies fail, it is a structural defect, they simply lack the power to change the situation. More power to the councils, so to speak."
"Yes and no, control must be, but rightly, constitutionally, it cannot be political control. This is the job of the public law oversight body (Broadcast &amp; TV Council, Board of Directors), but it doesn&#39;t work in practice. We have to change."

Should we then get to the EEG for the same framework conditions?
No. The blame is on the car manufacturers who have not kept to the limit values. The fact that politicians have promoted the sale of diesels is due to the fact that diesel engines are more efficient than petrol engines and therefore generate less CO2.
"... and in principle, politics should not dictate what is most efficient. We have engineers who work on solutions. The FDP will not prescribe which solution will prevail. We are not a planned economy and do not plan to introduce it."
"Problem is shortened. Storage problem of renewables can be mitigated via Power2liquid; Ethanol fuel cells can build on existing liquid fuel infrastructure; Lantern parking commuters only get their cars charged when new cables are laid, etc."

"Because you only approve reform discussions as long as the amount of the broadcasting fee is not called into question. Everything else is supposedly &quot;polarization&quot; &amp; consequently morally reprehensible. However, we have to talk about #publicvalue &amp; real structural reforms. @fdp @Liberale_News @DLF https://twitter.com/udostiehl/status/949965752156721152‚Ä¶"
My speech b @fdp 3K18: ‚ÄúMy parents - both over 80 - are excited for the future of our society. They too are New Generation Germany ‚Äù=&gt; Dear Mr. Lauterbach: New Generation is a state of mind. Don&#39;t worry: you are not one of them. @Dana_Heide @K_Moessbauer

"BEER: Openness and really free access to #education, for #rising on your own to help against fears. They are the best recipe against the fear of descent. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)"
"BEER: Because we believe in all people, the issue of social advancement through our own efforts and education is so central to us. And there is a shortage in Germany because the ascent engine is stalling. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)"
BEER: We as politicians are responsible for giving people a # perspective for their own # future. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)
"BEER: The approach of permanent restraint, peace in the cemetery and silent concerns is not ours. It is concisely identified by a symbol: the # diamond. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)"
BEER: A country of discoverers and inventors does not remain or will not be created by a self sufficient government. You can become a country with the best education and innovation in the world by creating opportunities. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)
"BEER: Politics is not an end in itself, is not a job like any other, political action is always of a service nature. We serve the people in our country. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)"
BEER: The world is turning and changing faster and faster. That is why sticking to the status quo is so dangerous. That is why new thinking is so important. And that&#39;s why a new generation of Germany is needed. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)
"BEER: We have to advance as pioneers, as pioneers and take the population with us into the future. # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)"
What image of people should our society have and how should politics ensure this? # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)
"BEER: With our election program, which we developed in intensive dialogue with actors from society and #FDP, we are well prepared for 2018 and new challenges! # Epiphany meeting # 3K18 @Liberale_News @fdp @FDPHessen @fdpbt (TB)"
"Mr. Kellner, simple question: Did Cem Oezdemir and KGE have final authorization to conduct the explorations, or did they have to have the interim result approved by the party? (Team Beer)"
"No, the @cem_oezdemir also had no power of attorney to conclude the negotiations (KGE just as little) and had to have each party approve each interim result of the negotiations individually. Or does @MiKellner want to publicly contest here? (Team Beer)"
Then ask the Greens if you have been there for #Jamaica and torpedoed the soundings. Or what do you think why the Greens chose two Realos for the first time after the Jamaica exit and sent the Fundis into the desert? (Team Beer)
