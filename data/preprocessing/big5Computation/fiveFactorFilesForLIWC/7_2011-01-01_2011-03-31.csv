"At the ZDF in Kiel, where the studio manager changes, then the party council meets to prepare for the state party conference in Husum."
"All in all, song on black-yellow, red-green and green-red governing in the south ahead! Music tip: Alice Cooper &quot;Elected&quot;. Nice Monday!"
"Good morning from Berlin. Committees meet after an eventful election Sunday. Green clear election winner, despite loss of vote SPD in charge!"
"Nowhere in Germany does black and yellow have a majority: Neither HH nor ST, BaWü or RP."
I spoke at an anti-Nazi rally in front of Lübeck Central Station Diversity versus simplicity! Good response! Together against brown spirit!
"Percentage for SPD in BaWü and RLP may not be satisfactory. The political result is: SPD + Greens rule both countries, Kurt Beck MP!"
"Great prospects in Ba-Wü + RLP. Congratulations to Nils Schmid + Kurt Beck, order for SPD and Greens, FDP and Left not needed! Merkel done!"
Very friendly welcome at the AFA state conference in Eutin. Now speak at the anti-Nazi demo in Lübeck for tolerance against brown spirit!
"“@Tsghessen: Good luck and success for Kurt Beck, Nils Schmid and the SPD in BaWü, RLP and Hessen!” And the Hessian SPD too!"
@timbeil how funny. You just forget that this is not about FDP supporters.
"In Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate as well as the Hessian municipal elections, the population of black and yellow nuclear politics can show a red card! #SPD +++"
On the way to SPD workers in Eutin: Strong and reliable! Then to the anti-Nazi demo in Lübeck!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Keep your fingers crossed for SPD party friends in Ba-Wü, RLP and Hessen! Music tip: Queen &quot;We are the champions&quot;. Nice sun!"
Curious: At Guttenberg&#39;s Lug + Trug there was fan applause + late pomp + Gloria resignation.Brüderle has stress because of truth about CDU / FDP anti-tomation tactics
"Odd world: Despite Lug Trug, Guttenberg only steps back after a long hesitation and with pomp and fan applause. Brüderle tells the truth"
Music tip: Neil Young &quot;Heart of gold&quot;. Happy weekend everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm on this wonderfully cool spring Sunday. Today to the AFA in Eutin, anti-Nazi demo Lübeck and Steinburger SPD."
Good mood with the Schenefeld SPD and its great mayor Christiane Küchenhof!
As with Guttenberg&#39;s doctorate: Schwarzgelb wants to temporarily suspend attitudes towards nuclear energy (until after the elections).
On the way to the district party conference of the Steinburger SPD in Hohenlockstedt. Closed SPD will win state election in SH in May 2012!

After a good state parliament meeting today and a visit to the Greens in Preetz to honor the local politician of the SPD.
@ pgk1966 man&#39;s will is his kingdom of heaven ....
"@myBordesholm this finding is nice, we have long said - against violent protests from Carstensen &amp; Co."
"Many thanks to Rainer Brüderle for the last-minute motivation boost of the SPD campaigners in Ba-Wü., RLP and Hessen! #EhrlichePolitik"
It is a shame that SH-FDP can neither prevail in the Federal Party nor in the SH coalition against the Union with a real nuclear phase-out course!
"If you really want to phase out nuclear power, you have to vote for the SPD or get a red-green majority."
"@LarsWinter Congratulations to Wolfgang Mädel, the re-elected AFA state chairman!"
Brüderle seems to be an honest man: voters in Ba-Wü. and Rl-Pf. learn in good time before the election that nuclear phase-out is just a tactic!
Greetings back! @RASimoneWeber @diephotographin @sylvialoehken @erdosse @marcusschuler @koish @rahildebrand @ggvogt @weltonline
Brüderle (FDP) publicly confirms that black and yellow 7 German nuclear power plants temporarily shut down only because of state elections. Any questions?
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today&#39;s electoral law in the state parliament. Music tip: Men without hats &quot;The safety dance&quot;. Happy Thursday everyone!
Nuclear debate in the state parliament shows that black-yellow with soft-washed exit rhetoric wants to get through election dates + blocked exit law.
@knuddellove how true that is!
Music tip: Tom Jones &quot;Send in the clowns&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone nice in the timeline and everyone else what they deserve!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today&#39;s state parliament with a nuclear debate. Many who do not mean well with the SPD know exactly what is good for the SPD!
And then the CDU and FDP can also be celebrated on all front pages in SH for alleged insight. Brüderle reveals that as a farce!
@DerBruesseler You underestimate the intelligence of the population: People recognize Merkel &amp; Westerwelle&#39;s campaign panic.
On the way to the application committee for the preparation of the state party conference on April 9/10 in Husum.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today meetings of the parliamentary group and preparation of the state party convention. Music tip: Gipsy Kings &quot;Bamboleo&quot;. Nice day!
"As a social democrat, I see it differently: small steps in the right direction are better than standing still and much better than going backwards!"
@DerBruesseler how about a contradiction in terms? So old fashioned with arguments and so ...
@kleinkram well - have a nice day in the capital; -}
Some believe that the &quot;anti-atomic cloud&quot; warps like an atomic cloud and then everything can continue as before to Chernobyl!
"Anyone who honestly admits nuclear error is welcome with a new energy consensus for a consistent energy transition, situational turning necks are not!"
"Anyone who is still opposed to swift, clear and irreversible nuclear phase-out either still has no idea or wants to deceive voters!"
Those who pulled the nuclear deal with the nuclear industry ice cold call the campaign&#39;s &quot;moratorium&quot; more consistently than the red-green nuclear consensus.
Debate on atomic energy is extremely absurd: Those who have always problematized the dangers of atomic energy &quot;instrumentalize&quot; the nuclear meltdown.
On the way to Glinde for the Stormarner SPD party congress. Wonderful spring weather!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today to Glinde for the district party congress of the Stormarner SPD. Music tip: Joe Cocker &quot;Delta Lady&quot;. Happy Saturday!
"Election campaign panic at black and yellow leads to an interruption of thinking: with the pro-atom government, not with the electorate !!"
@RASimoneWeber @leumund @leamaria @heraldday @betriebsberater @weltonline @danielluecking @geelinde @marancon Warm regards back!
Good morning from Magdeburg. Final spurt in the state election campaigns. Music tip: Talking Heads &quot;Road to nowhere&quot;. Happy Friday everyone!
"Real nuclear phase-out is only possible with the SPD and the Greens, not with a black-and-yellow moratorium placebo for the electorate."
Good campaign day in Saxony-Anhalt. SPD in a good mood. Black and yellow nuclear opportunism does not catch people.
Good morning from Magdeburg. Today state election campaign in Saxony-Anhalt. Music tip: Simply Red &quot;Do the right thing&quot;. Have a nice Thursday!
Right in Magdeburg.
"Today council of elders and faction meeting, then to a funeral service and in the evening to Magdeburg. Saxony-Anhalt votes on Sunday."
"Music tip: Werner Lämmerhirt &quot;Corinna, Corinna&quot;. Nice day! It is rather difficult when you hear the news."
Good morning from Bordesholm. News from Japan more and more appalling. Gloomy outlook.
Constituency round in Langwedel. Much support from the comrades.
"I have informed the CDU and FDP faction leaders about the new election law and the election date of May 6, 2012."
Back in SH. Situation in Japan apparently largely out of control.
News from Japan keeps getting worse. Compassion for the people in the region. Nuclear power cannot be controlled by humans!
"Musiktip: James Taylor ""You've got a friend""."
"Good morning from Frankfurt. Back to Kiel to parliamentary groups, negotiations on the electoral law and round in the constituency. Good Tuesday!"
Mappus in Today&#39;s Journal stammering proves that the moratorium on the nuclear deal to extend the term is only a campaign calming pill.
After the campaign event in Lambsheim back to Frankfurt. Voters know that black and yellow warning signs warn of radioactivity!
Spoken on anti-nuclear rally in Frankenthal. Against black and yellow stupor tactics: Nuclear consensus now! Old reactors from the network!
Suspending for three months means nothing: All nuclear power plants continue to run and Merkel &amp; Westerwelle hope that grass will grow over the matter # Deselect!
Federal government sells population for stupid: Extension of term of election for state elections &quot;to be suspended&quot; without collecting nuclear deal # fail
Black and yellow simulates a readiness to exit the nuclear power plant in a panic before the state elections.
The pressure must now be intensified to cancel the government + nuclear industry term deal!
Music tip: Stefan Waggershausen &quot;Time never waits&quot;. Happy Monday everyone!
Good morning from Mainz. Today board meeting and election campaign in Rhineland-Palatinate.
"Jam-packed S-Bahn in Frankfurt, where ICE arrives 65 minutes late."
Wonders about the cynicism of some proponents of atomic energy.
Embankment fire near Bad Bevensen- ICE delayed by 1 hour. Train dialogue next to me: Man is an alien - just not on Earth. Hmm.
Hold @knuddellove musically ?!
News from Japan is becoming more and more threatening: compassion for the people affected (think globally) - fight for the nuclear phase-out (act locally).
@MartinHaller gladly
"@anicatha strange understanding of politics, to call &quot;exploit&quot; nuclear energy in this nuclear catastrophe question of responsibility."
@radio_tunestorm You don&#39;t have to read that. Twitter and Facebook are voluntary!
"1. Help for Japan 2. Undo the extension of the runtime, get out of the nuclear power + energy transition, that&#39;s the right consequence!"
Anyone who is now only tactical and appeasing with a view to state elections has not understood the dimension of the processes. # Nuclear consensus now!
@csommer was the same with the Kohl government after Chernobyl in Germany!
On the way to Mainz: Presidium of the SPD and election campaign in Rhineland-Palatinate. Kurt Beck is the best prime minister for my country of birth!
"@augensternchen_ you will probably not be allowed to rely solely on hope, since the nuclear industry is about billion-dollar interests!"
@tho_albrecht this is neither for jokes nor for cynicism! Nuclear energy is not responsible! Use must be ended quickly!
"Where man is not allowed to make mistakes without potentially catastrophic consequences, or believes that he has conquered the forces of nature, repentance is necessary!"
Time to rethink: Back to nuclear consensus in Germany! Get out of dangerous nuclear energy as quickly as possible because of people &amp; technology &amp; nature!
"Music tip: CCR &quot;Who&#39;ll stop the rain&quot;? Happy Sunday everyone, the thought is with people in Japan who have a lot to endure."
"Good morning from Bordesholm. News from Japan is stunned - also about indolence, not to learn from atomic mistakes!"
@CoriSprotte it is a difference what you want politically and what you can enforce under the Atomic Energy Act!
@DerBruesseler sometimes you should check your prejudices after all - how do you come to such a conclusion?
@CoriSprotte we don&#39;t want to see Krümmel or Brunsbüttel on the net. This SPD position is known in SH!
What else has to happen before nuclear energy is reversed? # # AufkündigungAtomkonsens fail
@DerBruesseler I expressly do not do that - but just respect for the victims demands a clear commitment to the nuclear phase-out!
"Harrisburg, Chernobyl, Fukushima - happens again and again, which &quot;experts&quot; had declared practically impossible. Atomic power - no thanks!"
Those who feel with the victims have the task to finally fight for nuclear phase-out + to regain nuclear consensus in Germany against the CDU / FDP!
"25 years after Chernobyl, we have known for a long time that nuclear energy turns human and technical mistakes or even natural forces into catastrophes!"
"In view of the victims in Japan, party political small children are out of the question. Nevertheless, it remains crystal clear that nuclear energy is not responsible!"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Depressing disaster reports from Japan. Nuclear energy is not responsible - once again sad clarity!
Local club round at the Nortorfer SPD. Good and open discussion about the situation of the SPD: We want to win the LT elections together!
@danielas thought the dangers of atomic energy become frighteningly obvious at such events - that&#39;s what it&#39;s about.
I think @LarsWinter is great. Greetings to the comrades!
@manomama others come again. ; -}

"@DerBruesseler, by the way, you need majorities to enforce political decisions, sometimes in the Bundestag and Bundesrat!"
"Of course, Afghanistan is more important than allegations of plagiarism against would-be academics. &quot;Exceptional politicians&quot; are bad at maintaining power."
Majority of online surveys for Guttenberg resignation - very different than claimed!
Speaks for itself: nobody speaks of the state government when it comes to political leadership! They have nothing to say about that. MP Carstensen pinches.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today the state parliament is about &quot;political leadership (lack of confidence)&quot;. Music tip: Rolling Stones &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.
"A bank robber is put in. He says I made mistakes, voluntarily return the loot + stay unpunished? Hello? Do we remember anything?"
@DerBruesseler
"Every little crook has to vouch for his mistakes, the Minister zu Guttenberg turns the whole nation&#39;s long (Pinocchio) nose!"
Wagnerian drama with stages in Bayreuth and Berlin. The seemingly purified hero whistles at bourgeois values: Everything just stolen!
The Baron zu Guttenberg is now officially exposed as imposter: Uni Bayreuth withdraws the self-defense minister&#39;s doctorate.
"A notorious impostor and lying baron sees himself as a role model, because others could learn from his mistakes and remains a minister!"
Black and yellow in the state parliament today clearly beyond the embarrassment limit!
&quot;The management of a ship is not entrusted to the best-of-the-house traveler.&quot; (Bease Pascal)

Good morning from Bordesholm. Start of the state conference today. Yesterday Urban Priol in &quot;News from the asylum&quot; wonderfully to impostor affair.
What fascinates so many people about an impostor: the power of the boulevard or: exciting interior views of the state of our republic.
@ victor5679 is that your moral concept? Berlusconi stations also have a lot of viewers!
No adolescent boy would be allowed to go through what the black baron claimed for himself. Double upper class morality!
"The thing with zu Guttenberg is becoming more and more abstruse: claims hui, reality ugh. Great morale and PR glamor in the pose, very generous with ego."
@Sisterf is also available from Sting alone - I have CD on CD - best regards.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Cold start of the day. Today parliamentary bodies. Music tip: Sting &quot;Walking on the moon&quot;. Happy Tuesday everyone!
"It is the professors who have not noticed that to blame, says Mr. Glos! Bravo!"
"He didn&#39;t apply as head of the Max Planck Society, says Michel Glos on ZDF - wow! There&#39;s no business like show business!"
"It is hard to believe how the tables are now to be turned around: the baron is a good minister, what makes a bit of deceit!"
It&#39;s more about appearances than being - that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about and not just about dubious academic dignity. Belusconi sends his regards when the baron gets away with it.
Dr.Googleberg fools the public and flirts with the plagiarism affair in the Hessian local election campaign: everything as a PR show
I am very happy about great support texts on www.meineStimmefuerRalf.de! Thanks also to the maintainer of the M.Slogsnat website!

"@c_vogtYou know that we had school peace until Chaos Minister Klug overturned everything, so with school law changes, school peace again!"
I often commented on difficult election results in the SH magazine of the NDR - today a pleasure to rate great HH results.
"@frankthepoor na na: SPD + 15-16% that&#39;s strength, CDU halved, that&#39;s weakness, isn&#39;t it?"
"School Peace + Kita-contribution freedom. After the election victory in SH, we will do both with changes to the school law and re-entry free of charge!"
Magnificent election victory for HH SPD.Olaf Scholz fits HH and HH SPD. Economic reason and social cohesion! Tailwind for SPD!
"Olaf Scholz wins with promises of free daycare fees, struggle for minimum wages, economic reason + social cohesion like SH SPD"
Tailwind for SPD especially in SH. Hopefully the CDU / FDP election day will not be delayed forever because they are bang-headed!
Super election result for SPD in Hamburg. After NRW now in HH 2nd government leadership recaptured. CDU is punished. Black yellow without a future!
I wish you a nice nose!
Today in Hamburg: choose #SPD and @Olaf Scholz. Every vote counts! Finally serious government for Hamburg again!

"(3) to criticize the black and yellow majority and to order early elections. This is not about Belarus, but about SH!"
(2) In Kiel conservative professor calls for the abolition of the new state constitutional court because it had dared to commit unconstitutional
Morning reading offers astonishing things: Everyone talks about the &quot;Baron zu Googleberg&quot; and who wrote the doctoral thesis (1).
@RASimoneWeber I also greet you warmly back to Munich!
It is said that it is ego trip + difficult agreement if you publicly postpone your own positions + is willing to compromise. #Politikparadox

Very good conversation with PSE boss Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. Great agreement on the subject of social democratic progress.
The federal government apparently does not want an agreement with the SPD in negotiations on aid for children and the amount of transfer payments.
Music tip today: Santana &quot;Jingo&quot;. Have a nice Wednesday.
Good morning from Brussels. Numerous interesting appointments today. First meet Paul Nyrup Rasmussen the chairman of the PES.
Nice evening with Ulrike Rodust and FES boss Gerber in a small Brussels restaurant.
Arrival in Brussels for political talks with a very interesting program.
Oh now all the fans of the &quot;fathers of clothes&quot; are reporting.
Unfortunately it is sad rather than funny what the liberals deliver!
Ekkehard Klug &amp; Wolfgang Kubicki = Oliver Hardy &amp; Stan Laurel of SH politics.
And the Union is cycling in tandem Carstensen &amp; von Boetticher. Unfortunately on the exercise bike in the dark basement: getting around for SH: Nothing!
"In the SH election campaign, FDP posted: &quot;We can do what we do&quot;. The truth is: they only do what they can - and unfortunately that is bitterly little!"
Political sabotage part 2: wannabe Schwarzenegger Kubicki sabotages political culture and decency by attacking employees.
"In the case of minority politics, everyone is betting on a change of government in SH. Enough porcelain smashed by CDU / FDP. SPD fixes that!"
It is now important to actively include regional interests in Ostholstein. Only the SPD does that!

Good morning from Bordesholm. All day today constituency visit to Norderstedt. Music tip: Headroom &quot;Reason spreads ...&quot;.
Attempts from the outside to reduce this to &quot;duel&quot; did not work. Solid debate about content thanks also to Brigitte Fronzek and Mathias Stein!
"I&#39;m really happy about the great response to our candidate tour, and even initial critics of my proposal are now full of praise! # SPD +"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Great end of the candidate tour yesterday in Tarp. Today faction. Music tip: Stevie Wonder &quot;Superstition&quot;.
Members now have a choice of which political program they want to see. Rather SPD profile a la agenda + &quot;new center&quot; or progressive SH SPD !!
Brilliant final round of the SPD series in Tarp. 350 guests experience exciting discussion with clear differences in the political profile!
"Overall, however, good and fair reporting and great SPD advertising! That will make school! Dare more democracy! #SPD +++"
"Individual reports reveal more about authors than about candidates, whether they are bad-tempered editors, hobby psychologists or cynics on Sunday work."
Many press reports about the last round of candidates. Praise for our great process also from those who initially criticized my proposal.

@augensternchen_ there is something there!
"Instead of Kraftmeierei + Guttenberg&#39;s farm sacrifice, conditions on Gorch Fock have to be clarified on the matter + abuses must be eliminated without reservation!"
Kurt Beck is right when he says that Guttenberg can also be photographed lying on the stairs of the ministry if he does his job properly!
Sunday newspapers show - albeit with different comments - Guttenberg as a politician who mainly has Image + PR in mind.
@juliaspreen all the best!

Music tip for a sad occasion: Gary Moore &quot;I still got the blues&quot;. Happy Tuesday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today DGB chief Polkaen in the SPD parliamentary group, later to political talks in Brussels."
We know party book management in the departments in SH before 1988! Such accusations today are indecent!
How poor it is to blame one&#39;s own political incompetence for the alleged disloyalty of &quot;red&quot; officials. # Deselecting!
"Carstensen, von Boetticher, Kubicki and Klug are responsible for the government of chaos - not the efficient government employees!"
Lots of outraged reactions from ministry workers about the CDU / FDP dillettante coalition&#39;s attacks on employees!
Great event at Glinder Social Democrats. Good and lively discussion. Very motivating and great interest!
On the way to the SPD in Glinde / Stormarn.
"@Penzoldie well - if you take your level as a benchmark, you shouldn&#39;t say anything publicly - everyone embarrasses himself as best he can!"
Return to Hamburg by ICE!
"Unfortunately I can no longer take part in a festive event on the 85th birthday of Hans Jochen Vogel, who participated in the discussion today!"
You are really right! RT @manomama: It&#39;s incredible to see what&#39;s going on when you want it to go.
Very good negotiation performance by our team around Manuela Schwesig. Little by little improvements to the bad of the Leyen package thanks to the SPD!
Anyone who saw the duo infernale Tunix (Carstensen) &amp; Tunichtgut (Kubicki) in action at the weekend knows why the CDU &amp; FDP are afraid of new elections!
Embarrassing state government in SH: Kubicki blames the failure of the FDP education chaos minister Dr.Klug on the officials.
SPD Presidium and Party Council in Berlin. Then talk to the Central Council of Jews and in the evening to the SPD local association in Glinde.
@AngieDor I wish you too; o}

@Loriotta Kubicki publicly questions Minister Klug&#39;s leadership ability. Where the man is right ...
"@RasmusAndresen with regard to this question, the wording was correct - but not with this connotation. Is about CDU or SPD-MP."
"@Stecki This party really isn&#39;t that important. Letter to the Editor S.2 SHZ from today, livestream and open channel is also unique!"
@klarekante This is nonsense. Correction today at SHZ p.2
"@Stecki Wrong representation, which is corrected today in the SHZ."

Reception at the Hamburger Abendblatt with many guests. In the &quot;duel&quot; Ahlhaus against Scholz even neutral people could clearly see the difference!
"Musiktip:Joshua Kadison ""Postcards from L.A.""."
Most press comments today rate yesterday&#39;s FDP Epiphany meeting as a staged denial of reality by Westerwelle &amp; Co.
Roads partly smooth as glass - so drive all carefully! Better to arrive a little slower and safely!
Music tip for thaw: Joshua Kadison &quot;Postcards from LA&quot;. Happy Friday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today for the Hamburger Abendblatt, then the Nordfriisk Institute in Bredstedt and New Year&#39;s reception Bordesholm."
"RT @FDPBW: # 3k11 Standing ovation for Guido Westerwelle in the Stuttgart Opera House, rousing speech that delighted the audience. Without words!"
Now it&#39;s done. 70 minutes of self-suggestion. This FDP is not a threat - it is on the way to the opposition - probably less than 5%!
"Aha, now comes the red sock passage and the criticism of the NRW government. Freedom instead of socialism is crazy topical!"
"Finally, Afghanistan - so far no sentence of self-criticism or analysis - only loudspeaker without perspective. Enough for 2% hardcore FDPists!"
"Finally, praise for Sarrazin and again and again the &quot;we got through&quot; passages. Only missing the pounding!"
Westerwelle: Solidarity is not a one-way street! This is true! Guido Westerwelle should remain head of the FDP! We keep our fingers crossed!
You almost feel pity when you listen to the loud Westerwelle phraseology!
It is a pity that no more people are chasing Phoenix. Westerwelle speech is an active election aid for red-green policy changes in HH and soon in SH!
Westerwelle: &quot;I don&#39;t want to go into current issues today&quot;. Aha. We already noticed!
Westerwelle: &quot;Whether it&#39;s sun or rain we&#39;re always against it.&quot; He means the opposition. Why are there so many voters against Westerwelle?
Westerwelle warns of fear - with terrible speech!
Late Roman decadence à la Stuttgart 2011: bathe in a warm denial of reality. Three kings brought material to Westerwelle!
Www.burgburg de. Westerwelle claims that everything is actually good. All that&#39;s missing is the &quot;I love you all&quot; passage!
Westerwelle calls for a liberal immune system to be activated against reality and the criticism of black and yellow selfish politics!
When do hotelier gifts come up?
"The FDP should not ask how their policies are received, but should have the courage to do the right thing. Forward to the extra-parliamentary opposition!"
"Westerwelle insults demos and praises the courage to adopt a policy that the FDP leads below 5%. Keep it up, Guido!"
"Westerwelle starts with a real retro speech, praises Germany, talks about patriotism and claims that the FDP has mastered the economic crisis."
Carstensen protects FDP from Seehofer.Newly sharp political analyzes? Probably gut feeling that black and yellow end is approaching!
Good morning from snowy Bordesholm. Drive carefully! Music tip: Amy MacDonald &quot;The road to home&quot;. Magnificent voice! Nice day!

@ Marschensch what do you have to take to formulate such wisdom?
Berlusconi always speaks of left-wing conspiracies against the great leader of the people!
"Only because of a little trickery and deception must not overthrow the great defense minister - that would be mean, it&#39;s just envy anyway!"
(2) is not that bad at Adel + Herrschaft.Quod licet Iovi non licet Bovi. The ox is not allowed to do what Jupiter is allowed to do!
"Some expressions of opinion on the Guttenberg case are reminiscent of Berlusconi&#39;s Italy. What no student or mere mortal, soci etc can do (1)"
Warm welcome for Olaf Scholz in the Berlin Willy-Brandt-Haus!
"Everywhere in Berlin, too, praise for our great candidate selection process. SPD members decide - on February 26th is counted. # SPD ++"
