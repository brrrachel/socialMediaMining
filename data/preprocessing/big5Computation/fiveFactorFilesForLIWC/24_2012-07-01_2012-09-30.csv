"@LinkeFeminist, you&#39;ve heard that freedom of religion is a human right, haven&#39;t you? Feel free to send the site"
@ Linke feminist criminal complaint from you at the Cologne public prosecutor&#39;s office is enough. The place of jurisdiction for internet crimes is the flying place of jurisdiction
@salz_zur_sahne @linkefeministin now read what I have already written. Hate endless repetitions
@ froschmann1968 that was not your question and is not my agrgument anyway
@salz_zur_sahne @linkefeministin no
. @ anschlagzettl then we are back with the popular anti-Semitic relief argument: Jews = fascists.
"@ froschmann1968 but I&#39;m not like that, there is more to it, you have to search for yourself http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/…"
@ Yp142 depends. Does not fit in 140 characters. @linkefeministin
"@ Null3528 @anschlagzettl did I say that? No, take care of the shoe you are putting on yourself #antisemitism"
"@sshaked @linkefeministin correct legal but basically represented by the parents Article 4 also applies to children, it may be a Jew"
@ froschmann1968 i am not your google; don&#39;t think it&#39;s a relevant argument either.
"@pangu no, because some intersections reveal a spiritual basis"
"@Tahnja No, you request a pension from 0 BGE @sauberhaui"
Right! @robinwagener nevertheless there is a need to compensate for collisions
"@LinkeFeministin Super, then we have the pattern process that we need. Tip: do in Cologne, otherwise it will fail."

"@sauberhaui Germany should have previously agreed to this in the Board of Governors, with the participation of the Bundestag. Otherwise it won&#39;t work"
@LinkeFeminist then show me. Female genital mutilation cannot be justified.
@salz_zur_sahne did you read what I said? Female genital mutilation cannot be justified!
@Bjoernchen BNT Live 7.30 Ortstzeit
@ froschmann1968 who not Jews
@Politikprofi that was now an argument? and what did they want to describe with which term and with which relevance to fundamental rights ????
@DerProVomKlo That shouldn&#39;t be an argument anyway. You can find information on this at the WHO
"@sauberhaui and it was too imprecise and not even German to answer. Not everything fits in 140 characters, I know."

"@herr_nicolai Yes, I found it very funny and very American!"
"@JP_Stich @AlexanderNabert Right Mostly, foreskin-possessing men are involved in the debate about circumcision."

"@ pgk1966 @TwittingThom Second instance: acquittal because of mistake in prohibition, other statements are only obiter dictum"
"@ajkaestner We are a religiously and ideologically neutral state, that is a difference."
"@Urbster Yes, but also there is a consideration of the limits of the right of self-determination of the religious community. They can do that with priests."
"@Urbster Yes, but that also includes the dignity of the believing Jew"
Don&#39;t criminalize Jews in Germany! Religious circumcision in boys through a reasonable (cont) http://tl.gd/i462dv
"@hellojed No, read my tweets or PMs and you will know why"
. @ Tondey_Nivek So you want to forbid Jews to grow up as Jews + require that they later convert to Judaism. Sounds strange
@ Kaiser Media or otherwise justified.
"@TwittingThom shafts are permitted with a special permit, not prohibited. Right!"
"@ChaOzZzX No, make yourself familiar with the Basic Law, fundamental rights and http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praktische_Konkordanz…"
Why is it not surprising that I find a high intersection with # ESM and circumcision opponents in the timeline?
@DavidKosename &quot;more important&quot; is the wrong question. Ultimately decision by @BVerfG or EGMR
@herr_nicolai Because the procedure is incomparable. Subordinate: There is also no religious reason for circumcision girls
@dafLOh No.
@Impertinenzija Practical concordance does not mean skat: Ober beats Unter.

"@hellojed do not construct any examples, since practical concordance only allows for a concrete consideration."
@joergimd You have forgotten parental rights in Article 6. The fundamental rights positions collide
"@AlexanderNabert religious freedom even without reservation of legal restriction, physical integrity with. # ausGründen"
@AlexanderNabert Conflicts of fundamental rights have to be compensated for because of the practical concordance.

Anyone who leads the Basic Law against religious circumcision should take a look at it: Freedom of Faith http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/4.html…
@florianklenk You just want to deny the Jewish child to live according to God&#39;s 1st command to his people = must not be a Jew

"@Doener Respect for different, religious and ideological views is the foundation of the rule of law"
@trendworx Human rights must not be overlooked in a banking and real estate speculation crisis.
@sauberhaui Don&#39;t think they&#39;re asking about circumcision.

"@Doener &quot;Enlightenment is not only the rule of reason, but at the same time an understanding of its limitations.&quot;"
"@Doener No, it doesn&#39;t say"
@florianklenk because the different understandings you postulate are no longer important.
