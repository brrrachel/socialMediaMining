"When influential journalists or #Youtubers call for non-voting or even for the destruction of democratic parties in the middle, it is a question of political culture. It is the middle parties in particular that defend democratic values every day. #Rezo"
It is absurd to assume that I want to regulate opinions. Freedom of expression is a valuable asset in democracy. But what we need to talk about are rules that apply in the election campaign. #Rezo #Youtuber

The focus of our debate is on emissions trading / certificates and other interesting proposals and is critical of CO2 tax. So different from what the shortened message suggests.
"We have to go about pricing when it comes to CO2 emissions. That is completely undisputed. The question is, how do we best do this pricing? Need a smart overall concept."
This is really good news for the future. üëç
"We openly discuss the CO2 pricing with the focus on control through emissions trading / certificates. In addition, there are also interesting proposals to relieve companies if they invest in CO2 reduction and much more. Please do not shorten the debate."
