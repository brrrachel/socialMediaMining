Why relativize?
"Right, national left, and?"
That the matter is again related to multi-culture is speculation? Then skilfully ignore the facts (left).
The perpetrator of #Christchurch is said to be an ‚Äúeco-fascist‚Äù and former communist according to his own manifesto. So how do left-wing fascists come to blame this act of horror on one-sided right conviction !? Here should be split and left-wing shots fall in again! #ADPM

You have hideous fantasies! I am rather thinking of denying those in the future any positions and areas of action in which they can again take action to the detriment of the people. And maybe they should be somehow involved in repairing the damage.
"Maybe you should take this to heart yourself, since you obviously have problems with freedom of expression in our solar system !? Think about it if that is somehow possible for you."
Not correct! At the moment there is speculation rather to give in to the political pressure. Farewell to the rule of law.

"Of course not from left ideologists! But since it can be found on skat cards, 2-euro pieces and on the lapel of many heads of state and is the national flower of Estonia, the left-hand demonization of the cornflower is embarrassingly ineffective."

"But they always jump on it again, delicious and # left stupid."
"The cornflower was never an official Nazi symbol, is also not prohibited and can currently be found everywhere in Germany and Europe as a positive sign. So save your agitation for left-hand circles."
Do you mean the over 100 years of positive significance in Germany?

But rights! And no left-wing extremists and agents.
So how are you showing it off?

Is it &quot;provocative&quot; to demonstrate against militant left-wing extremism wherever it occurs? So doesn&#39;t the Basic Law apply in red neighborhoods?
Is it a &quot;provocation&quot; to demonstrate peacefully against violent left-wing extremism?
"And so the meeting in Leipzig-Connewitz was denied and offered only one event location several kilometers away, outside of Connewitz."
The fact is: Leipzig-Connewitz is dominated by left-wing militant parallel society. Nice that we were able to disclose this.
"It was canceled for Leipzig-Connewitz! In addition, an alternative variant outside of Connewitz was proposed several kilometers away. Only inform then criticize."

Yes she is
So should the AfD never sit in a parliamentary group with other parties? You know that this is completely unreal?
"Nonsense! For change you may need parliamentary majorities, but not co-governing by referring to the old party cartel."
"Right is not the same as Nazi, you should have that much understanding of politics!"
"And you persist the day before yesterday, yes?"
"Yes and, but it&#39;s not about &quot;the party&quot;, but the idea behind it. If both no longer fit together, as originally, you have to choose which priority to follow."

How can you be a traitor if you stick to the course that the party sometimes does. reveals?
"Oh I have great empathy, for example towards the countless victims of the many # individual cases through multi-culture. And no, I quit earlier, whatever you want to understand."
I&#39;m guaranteed not to do that! And it is perfectly normal for MPs from different parties to work together in one parliamentary group.
I resigned from my office in the # AfD group SA earlier and left the group. My offer to remain as a simple member in the parliamentary group was rejected by the group leaders. The faction continues to decimate itself.
"If you respond to the constant construction sites and congestion that arises, yes, we have some catching up to do. However, this is not remedied by a speed limit."

"So if ‚ÄúIt‚Äù behaves anti-Semitic, for example? Let&#39;s not put away the Nazi club, case done. #linkeDauerhetze"

"Fortunately, leftist ideologues and neo-communists do not have to determine that."

"Indeed! After decades of shifting to the left, we need a shift to the right in the country."

"All right, don&#39;t mind. But should be added by &quot;Kommis out&quot;."
"Please keep the ball flat, the AfD &amp; Co. do not carry out terrorist attacks as we know them from the left."

"But what can the US be interested in, what they think?"
"Yes, &quot;was&quot; ..."
And the Greens and the SPD? Are you looking away?
"For example. not to disappear in the parliaments, but to remain engaged in the streets."
Because maybe he has no decency?
How so? You can easily cooperate in the state parliament afterwards! What is weakening there?
"Please write here via PN, thank you."

Agreement on the price of self-surrender? That cannot be the recipe.
Moderate? Do you mean to bow to the political correctness within the AfD?
"The #AfD is not my political opponent, even if the leadership did not stay on course.

But we don&#39;t - wzbw
This handshake was prevented by the party leadership.
Leaving the #AfD Yesterday I left after about five and a half years of membership. Ultimately there were permanently irreconcilable differences with the party leadership. The permanent paternalism in the West was also unacceptable. I am still friendly to the AfD.
But shouldn&#39;t politicians also engage with their counterparts and adapt in conversation?

"Well then, let&#39;s do it. Criminal wannabe refugees out there out! üá©üá™"
"So tolerance only at your own discretion, yes? At that time the Nazis probably thought that too. Tolerance only where it pleases."
"And the week begins again with unpleasant truths that link ideologists have to dismiss as &quot;baiting&quot;, due to the lack of their own arguments."
Did someone get attention from someone who doesn&#39;t want to pay attention to him? # Links stupid
"No, both are completely wrong here!"
A wall to ward off illegal mass immigration serves a purpose other than ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù that a people shared. That you have to explain that first ...
"Clearly, they are not acting in the interests of the people and we need a lot more transparency in politics."
So you are such an intolerant preacher of tolerance?
"Better than hollow post events of their kind, where no more 30 people can get there."
Again nothing but cheap #Nazikeule?
"Right, but at least a strong herd of horses! Who needs the mold there?"
"Why should it ever be boring to speak the obvious but unpopular truth? On the other hand, isn&#39;t it getting boring to prank this destructive left nonsense every day?"
Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that! üòâüá©üá™
Of course: &quot;Awakening of German Patriots&quot;!
Yes: MISSING PAPERS Asylum fraud !?
Violent left-wing extremists want ‚Äúonly their peace‚Äù? That was the best today!
We stay tuned! Even if the militant #link extremism first has the upper hand. The police &#39;s assessment of the situation stated &quot;that blockade attempts and other - including violent - disruptive actions can be expected&quot;. üá©üá™ 2019 http://m.lvz.de/Leipzig/Lokales/Poggenburg-kuendigt-neue-Proteste-in-Leipzig-an‚Ä¶ http://m.lvz.de/Leipzig/Lokales/Poggenburg-kuendigt-neue -Protests-in-Leipzig-to‚Ä¶
Politics is &quot;my job&quot;. # Links stupid
And again a Nazi leg swing ...
"First inform, then criticize! pic.twitter.com/7QxEdR5Xkx"
"Not one that has stood for patriotism, a love of home and nature on German soil for over 100 years."
"But the fact that others feel so &quot;provoked&quot; by living their right to freedom of expression is the real dilemma, isn&#39;t it? It reveals considerable deficits in the people&#39;s understanding of democracy."
One distributes the Nazi title with a swipe and downplayed historical Nazism. # Links stupid
To the schnitzel house!
If neo-communists want to check out.
Gathered around the open fire yesterday after work. Some women can probably not sufficiently appreciate such an evolutionary ritual and enjoy their photos. üòâ‚òùüèª Was it that way 5 or 10 thousand years ago? üòÑüî• pic.twitter.com/aH83JQwqJl
And that should lead to acts of violence from the left side !?
"Because link ideologists like you want it that way, right !?"
"Left-crazy! Something like that comes out with too much left-wing ideology, God forbid ... https://twitter.com/EmmaKoechner/status/1090937932691767296‚Ä¶"
The left? Right!
"My personal explanation in plenary: after left-wing deputies heard that the #cornflower can also be found on pieces of 2 ‚Ç¨ and skat sheets and that it is an Estonian national flower, they became uneasy. Left agitation versus facts = wonderful spectacle."
Because it depends on me and us on the many positive aspects of the cornflower.
There won&#39;t be another scandal today. https://twitter.com/mbock84340_bock/status/1090926893434654720‚Ä¶
"That&#39;s right, and on German soil it has been a symbol of affinity with home and patriotism for more than 100 years."
Why else the carnation?
"Yes, there were probably tens of millions more deaths under Stalin, Mao &amp; Co."
From which party office &quot;excluded&quot;? You mean resigned? Where did you get such misinformation from #linksunten?
Or maybe in his red party book?
"no, resigned, why?"
What is the message of the cornflower of the Germans? And now you are as consistent with Austria as with France.
"It is not about Morocco or Central Germany, but fundamentally about these utopian &quot;wisdoms&quot;, which, incidentally, were also not taught to women in Morocco. This do-good attitude is just unfamiliar and unrealistic."
"maybe not exactly, but a sensible variant between the German and the US weapons law"
on the left edge?
"So please, what&#39;s the nonsense?"
The right person wants that!
"That&#39;s the wisdom of the two young Scandinavian women who were slaughtered and beheaded bestially in Morocco, right?"
üòâ‚òùüèª
"How do you, as a left-wing class kasper, want to judge?"
Target shooters have &quot;inferiority complexes&quot;?
Do you want to tell us what we remember? #linksintolerant
"Gentle, otherwise you will fly! Something &quot;incapable of discourse&quot; itself, yes?"
"You live the day before yesterday, right?"
"The rule of law has strong inhibitions of biting crime from the extreme left, but also when it comes to foreign crime.

The repeated rejection of the # AfD candidate for the state deputy today in the Hesse state parliament wonderfully illustrates the existence of an intolerant old party cartel!
"And why is this not exactly true of left-wing extremism? Left parties are also everywhere with IL, VVN-BdA etc.?"
"the VS cannot watch because I was ‚Äúthere‚Äù. When I&#39;m out, I&#39;m out. Do you understand that?"

#Antifa = intolerant tolerance preachers who just don&#39;t get along with other political opinions and who harass even the most peaceful demos. This is #Left fascism! http://www.pi-news.net/2019/01/stuttgart-antifa-stoert-massiv-afd-mahnwache- Gegen-gewalt/‚Ä¶

"AWO threatens employees with AfD membership, one example of many. Get out of the left filter bubble!"

"I was never bankrupt, bankrupt and therefore broke. It will be expensive for you."
you can see it like this

"Does the left propagandist say? Forget it, your leftist ideology has cost tens of millions more victims, so pack up the worn-out Nazi school again."
Maybe have a look at the tweet beforehand!
I&#39;m not a left deceiver and trickster!
So you should also &quot;beat&quot; with a stupid insult to the left if you &quot;don&#39;t want to put up with it anymore&quot;?
"My esteemed colleague Frank Magnitz a strong will to survive and his family a lot of strength! Acts of violence against the #AfD increase every day, fascism is again in the outbreak and it is clearly coming from the left and through #linkeHetze. https://www.facebook.com/159841780842315/posts/1154124651414018?sfns=st‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2m64B7qvpa"
"In Germany, the cornflower has been a symbol of closeness to home and nature, struggle for freedom and patriotism for over 100 years. You don&#39;t have to tell me about that. And when or where have I ever spoken against ‚Äúdisabled people‚Äù? #linkerDauerhetzer"
Then stick to it!
"Why should I? What is wrong with this flower, what violates the Basic Law?"
"The #FDP is now also summoning the # Merkel twilight, which is good and correct for now! @C_lindner probably forgets something that liberalism was part of the problem and a breeding ground for Merkel&#39;s spirit. It is important to find a balance between performance and Solidarity! #AfD"
Violence against the AfD is steadily increasing and the question arises when the liberal-democratic constitutional state will tip over. The @COMPACTMagazin deals with this topic in its current video: https://youtu.be/um04O9wVaG0 pic.twitter.com/X0dmTnHPFt
"I choose d) as normal - because we all use the Nazi language, even you in your comment"
"No matter, direct hit on the opposing captain&#39;s cabin."
Funny ... in the GDR like Antifascism but had NO Antifa - so will hardly have anything to do with each other.
Right! Hence #NoAntifa!
"Violent explosion today in front of # AfD constituency office in Doebeln!

Well then explain exactly exactly.
Should I explain to him how to successfully campaign?
"How come? I already used the term Volksgemeinschaft in the state election campaign SA, the most successful AfD election campaign ever. So why should I go against my party&#39;s success? Explain times."
The Nazi leg reflex in left propaganda sheets! The @HuffPostDE is high again and has jumped far above the stick &quot;#Volksgemeinschaft&quot;.

"of course, not forbidden"
"Too stupid to recognize a question? Left, right?"

So the communist view of the world would be better? How many tens or hundreds of millions of dead did that claim again?
I&#39;m home...
The #Left fascism breaks out with great violence against property and body &amp; life of politically dissenting people and the # AfD leadership has nothing better to do than regulate the style of public relations in an inflationary manner through regulatory measures? That is very worrying ...
"I have never chanted &quot;lies press&quot;, you left-wing incitement."
"Well, for example, Ms. Kracher ... and all leftists who fight for world communism (today multi-cultural with prosperity for all)."
And communists too!
The woman writes for @taz and justifies the use of violence as well as murder and homicide against politically dissenting people. A typical representative of the new #Left fascism! #AfD pic.twitter.com/nBSNdI5oFQ
"The act was tasteless, right."
Save your left vulture. The perpetrators were disrespectful and now they are disrespectful.
We already know that your peers prefer to sweep under the carpet.
And again the left fascists beat.
"You are #Antifa, right? You can see right away - cheap, cheaper, bottom left."
Better than such acts of terror? But of course.
Well your first! Can not even admit that you wrote clear nonsense and only rushed with it.
"Yes, and communists out. So please go!"
The perpetrators tend to lack respect for people. #linkerDauerhetzer
"No, nothing is sacred to the perpetrators, you see."
Why should I give false testimony?
1. I do not cry 2. I do not upgrade National Socialism by letting our language do it like you
You don&#39;t want to know that in your case ...
"Exactly, and that is the difference to your peers."
Say leftists who cannot do without permanent enemy image #Nazi. ü§¶üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è
Any residual alcohol in the hum? Where did I say about living or letting myself die? # Links stupid
It&#39;s far away ...
"I just proved the opposite. Again # left stupid, yes?"
"Of course not happy, must be condemned and locked away!"
"Everything went well, so no left anarcho and detonator."
Do you mean your comment now?
When do you found the CPSU? There are still tens of millions more victims possible with left-wing ideas !?
Anti-Semitism is the cornerstone of National Socialism. I am not an anti-Semite and therefore not a Nazi. Education forms. #linkeHohlbirne
Why ridiculous? How many tens of millions of dead have your red ideas claimed in this world?
"That&#39;s rubbish! The connection compulsively establish your peers, nothing more. Pack the scuffed Nazi leg and troll yourself."
"Strangely, we got 24.3% and 15 direct mandates with SA and other plain text - because we don&#39;t let left-wing propagandists ban the German language. And now that is no longer part of AfD !? üòÑü§¶üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Yes and no
Blue please a lot! And better than red!
This is probably an obvious fact instead of speculation.
And with you nothing ticks (more)! Who should be more worried now?
"1. Saxony-Anhalt 2. not sofa but street 3. Comment is not only wrong, but # left-stupid"
Anyone who can read the article also knows that it was about Church Christ. With the &quot;stupid&quot; I do not want to contradict you.
I advocate a general responsibility for the migration gossip.
