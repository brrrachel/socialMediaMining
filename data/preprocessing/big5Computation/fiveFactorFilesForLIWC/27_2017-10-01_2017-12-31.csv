&quot;Do you hold to account&quot; is &quot;cleaning up&quot; for you? What day before yesterday do you actually live in? My goodness...
"Impressive words about another incredible bloody deed by a so-called &quot;refugee&quot;, who once again saw hospitality as a weakness and an invitation to murder and homicide.

But only in your confused left dreams! 🤦🏼♂️
It was clear that you are a &quot;Papi-Sager&quot; and intellectual lightweight. It is a shame to misuse the image of the comandante. 😉🇩🇪
"We believe that you use the term &quot;Papi&quot;. And &quot;slack&quot;? Man You are tired, there is nothing to laugh about!"
You misanthropic racist! You should be sued!
"Funny, when it comes to &quot;right&quot;, the left generalize too !? People who peacefully oppose multiculturalism and Islamization are all Nazis. National is not differentiated from nationalist, etc. ... But left hypocrites or how?"
"If you say I&#39;m making a fool of myself, then I&#39;m doing everything right, thanks for the motivation boost!"
"Anyone who walks around the world with left-ideological blinders will of course not see Islamism. No terrorist attacks, no assaults in Cologne, no daily isolated cases, no parallel societies, nothing nothing except National Socialism everywhere. 😂☝🏻"
"If you are worried, we will do everything right!"
Probably because they came in too easily !? And that must be changed in the future!
"No longer with the AfD, in contrast to the left, we are separating from such!"
"You mean left-wing extremists and criminal foreigners, yes?"
My god what&#39;s up with the lawn mower man! 😂
Jealous yes? It&#39;s normal for people like you.
Che Guevara would turn around in the grave with such an imp here ... it&#39;s embarrassing ...

The MZ is actually writing correctly. I &quot;provoked&quot; the left-wing extremists last year because I gave the MDR an interview!

What exactly would be &quot;correct&quot;?
What exactly is a lie? Typical stupid left-wing agitator?
"In the mirror, right? 😉"
"And? NO bankruptcy, NO arrest, NO arrest, just too late, but then open amounts paid with interest. Instead, burglary, property damage and left-wing radals in the company and in the house. Where&#39;s your problem? Bissl artificially upset, yes?"
Yes. And where is that from bankruptcy?
"So what? What did I say against it? Nevertheless: no bankruptcy, no loan debts and long paid-off estate. Left spinners don&#39;t like it, right?"
"The main thing left spinners are blessed with, right? 😂"
1. Arppe is gone 2. The alleged &quot;shift to the right&quot; has been going on for years in the AfD. Nice old wives tale.
"Your workplace, yes?"

"Yes, sweet super."

You are just too disinformed to know that it is gone!
They don&#39;t get the left to trivialize National Socialism if they constantly harass everyone and everything as &quot;Nazis&quot;.
Nobody expected more.
It&#39;s not one of us.
Pay special attention to spelling on Twitter? Now don&#39;t overdo it ...
The left and I think you just got the proof!

"I&#39;m sorry, the study went across Europe ..."
You should rather keep that and what you discuss with the institutional doctor to yourself. We wish you a speedy recovery!

"On #Arte: According to the study, IQ has been falling continuously since 1990! But left ideology + left-wing extremism = connection?"
"No, we don&#39;t need them either! But they are located here, but the criminal foreigners are not."

How do you want to know what I knew? And when is there a fine distinction between national and nationalist as with Islamic and Islamist?
"Not correct! Violent Islam should simply stay where it comes from, nothing more and nothing less. Everything else brings daily individual cases"
"Just as bad, but there was already enough left outcry. We want the balance to one-sidedness!"
The current attack in New York certainly has nothing to do with Islam! Honestly! ☝🏻😡 Our condolences to the many victims. #AfD #NoIslam

"If you read carefully, you will notice that I only &quot;replied&quot; and tried to adapt to the low level, it did not always work."

When is there a fine distinction between national and nationalist as between Islamic and Islamist? 🤔🇩🇪
"Fact: 1. there was no real foreclosure, at most a reduction 2. luckily less happened in the USA than many expected ..."
