Merkel refuses the second #TVDuell and now complains that not all topics have been discussed. What is to be made of it? #tvduell
Merkel: SPD countries less secure. Schulz: Highest crime rate in CDU-governed Saxony-Anhalt. Merkel: doesn&#39;t matter #TVDuell
Merkel praises the increase in the number of federal police officers (SPD initiative) and better legal protection §113 (SPD initiative) #TVDduell #MartinMachts
"The Merkel principle: block the topic, if there is pressure, supposedly to be &quot;open&quot;. #Sampling action is just an example #TVDuell"
"The question about Amri should go to the Chancellor, the Chancellery was the head of the secret services at the time, right? #TVDuell"
#Group action is the worse concept than #pattern action. But of course better than Merkel&#39;s blockade
"VAT reduction does not relieve rent and day care fees, hardly for groceries. Journalists don&#39;t understand low-income earners #TVDuell"
Merkel cannot name relief for the family because the CDU refuses to provide concrete tax rates #tvduell
"To date, the Federal Chancellery has not had a single request to change the draft #pattern declaratory action. Merkel cheats #tvduell"
#Faktencheck @MechthildHeil voted on 18.10.2016 for a decision against any form of &quot;collective redress&quot;
"You have to be so optimistic about it. But you know the CDU decision based on the #pattern declaratory action of October 18, 2016 #TVDuell"

The CSU Bayernplan is the already drawn up vote of no confidence in Merkel and the joint program
These unsuccessful complaints also cost a lot of money 😝
What do you think we do in @BMJV_Bund?

Only every second person gets a permanent job - But Merkel &amp; CDU think that&#39;s ok. SPD: Prohibit a time-limited limitation http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/nur-jeder-zweite-bekommt-einen-unbefristeten-job-a-1166300-amp.html…
"Correct analysis, only: Merkel blocks every measure that helps customers to get their rights. It protects the manager + company heirs https://twitter.com/cducsubt/status/904975020233039872…"
"Right: Federal government has been investing in broadband since the SPD became a government. No investment under CDU / FDP, only fees for mobile communications"
I&#39;m scared when Merkel or Lindner reduce digitization to broadband and Industry 4.0.
