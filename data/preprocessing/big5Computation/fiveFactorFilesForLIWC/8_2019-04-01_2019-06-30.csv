We live in a country with so many wonderful people. We can&#39;t let that spoil us. On #DonnerstagderDemokratie today I am thankful for Storch Heinar from @ER_MV. Because he too fights right hatred in a very wonderful way: with humor. pic.twitter.com/zXXli5Zrtu
I just shared this with my colleagues at @spdbt: pic.twitter.com/mw06s5covl
"Those who have just got up: That&#39;s enough, the polling stations are open until 6 p.m. üòâ #europaistdiesponse # European election2019"
"Large corporations operate globally, but the workers have no European right to strike, no European minimum wages. We need EU standards for good work. There is only one with a strong social democracy. Therefore today: SPD. #europaistdiesponse # European election2019"
"In a world with Trump, Putin and Xi Jinping, we need a strong Europe. And in a world where Amazon &amp; Co. don&#39;t pay taxes to us, we need a social Europe. The SPD is fighting for this. So: 1. Go vote! 2. Choose SPD! #europaistdiesponse # Europawahl2019 pic.twitter.com/QgyNKwdZSy"
Where the nationalists lead us can be seen in the first half of the 20th century: war and suffering. Where Europe leads us can be seen in the second: peace and freedom. #europaistdieantwort
"I made 94 appointments in this election campaign. Because with this destiny choice we have to defend our social model! We fight for a Europe in which respect has nothing to do with income, skin color or belief. #europaistdianswer pic.twitter.com/FN9qukm45b"
"Everyone wants to sell their goods in Europe. Imagine, we say: ‚ÄúIf you want to sell something in Europe, you have to adhere to our environmental standards.‚Äù If we leave nothing on our market for which the rainforest is cut down, we protect the climate. #europaistdieantwort"
Was asked about the media situation this morning. My answer: I am fighting for a social Europe and for a good result for the SPD in the European elections. I&#39;m holding my 94th event in the European election today. A good result benefits us all! pic.twitter.com/KWWac5YV1i
"In the Netherlands @TimmermansEU shows how it&#39;s done: Social Democracy was ahead on election day yesterday! Gefeliciteerd, dear Frans. For us in Germany that means now: roll up your sleeves, go out, add one more! #europaistdieantwort"
"With &quot;When Hitler Stole the Pink Rabbit&quot;, Judith Kerr succeeded in conveying the limitless cruelty of the Nazis to children. A literary feat. Your book will also help future generations to grasp the incomprehensible. Thanks for everything, #JudithKerr."
"I was just in Pforzheim for the SPD. Gudenus (known from #Strachevideo) was here on May 3rd for the AfD with Weidel and Meuthen. The scandal is not the video, but that the right allies to abolish Europe. We have to prevent that together this Sunday! pic.twitter.com/UGP7r8awdI"
"To #SCHUUULZ: No, it&#39;s not me, thanks for asking. But let me use the attention for a short advertising block: go vote this Sunday! üòâ"
"If I walk near my home country, I may be walking through another country. I feel at home all the way - I am German and European. On May 26th I choose a strong Europe for my homeland. @alicanglobal, thanks for # we2. pic.twitter.com/CrzThQpD0h"
"Chancellor Kurz wants to end the collaboration with #Strache. Of course that is correct. But you don&#39;t need a revelation video to find out - a conscience is enough, a history book helps. Vote for the best protection against law on May 26th!"
"Until the European elections, Berlin Central Station now shines in European splendor. In the entrance area we still have an exhibition for the # MyEurope campaign. Come over! Many thanks to @DB_Bahn and Richard Lutz who showed their attitude and made it possible. pic.twitter.com/vR3ujb4ITI"
&quot;It is enough for the triumph of evil if the good do nothing!&quot; So why are Europe&#39;s enemies louder than we - the vast majority - who find Europe good? Let&#39;s change that! We founded @ dosomething4eu yesterday. Join now! https://do-something-for-europe.com/ #myeurope pic.twitter.com/MiVgnPzrgy
"4 out of 5 Germans think Europe is good, but not even every second vote! We want to change that. That&#39;s why I started @ dosomething4eu with many supporters. It starts tonight on #Europe Day. Follow us and be there live! https://twitter.com/dosomething4eu/status/1124915752019087360‚Ä¶"
"Today we celebrate the #Tagder liberation and the end of the cruelest dictatorship in history. All the more astonishing: less than six years later, the FRG became part of the first precursor organization of the EU. This foresight of our friends in Europe freed us in the long term."
"Large corporations operate globally, but the workers have no European right to strike, no European minimum wages. The only sensible solution is: We need European standards for good work. That&#39;s why we&#39;re taking to the streets with the DGB today! # 1May # geMA1nsam pic.twitter.com/W5gvCLxPV5"

My reading tip for #WelttagdesBuches: &quot;1913&quot; by Florian Illies. An incredibly entertaining book that is as entertaining as it is educational and takes you into a very exciting year. Who has already read it: There is already a second part ...
"I wish you and your loved ones happy Easter, a pleasant get-together and relaxing holidays! My thoughts are also in #SriLanka, especially with the relatives of the victims and the injured. Even if it hurts: let&#39;s not get infected by this brutal hatred. pic.twitter.com/93QVat8oEh"
What a relief that the fire was under control! #NotreDame de Paris is a French icon and a symbol of our shared European history. It is our collective responsibility to rebuild it and the EU must contribute financially. Fluctuat NEC mergitur!
I talked to @TiloJung for a long time. The topic? #europaistdieantwort. https://youtu.be/Q-gVYIgtUtw
The result of # HarderK√ºhnel is also a rejection of the opportunism of Mr. Lindner and Mr. Brinkhaus.
