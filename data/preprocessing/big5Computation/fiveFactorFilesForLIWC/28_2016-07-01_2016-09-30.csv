Again an arson attack on the #AfD. Tonight it hit Frauke Petry&#39;s car.
@RebHarms is currently explaining that refugees only come to Europe in homeopathic doses. I am somewhat speechless. #AfD
"@ManfredWeber wants to save the EU with free Interrailtickets. If it wasn&#39;t a parliament, it would be funny here, but that&#39;s what he means"
