. @ stephanweil at # SPDBPT18: have responsibility that citizens feel well governed. Need stable government. pic.twitter.com/hk5edpXVsP
. @ stephanweil at # SPDBTP18: Fight out of conviction for grand coalition. I don&#39;t do politics so that the SPD is doing well. But so that the people who rely on us are better off!
. @ KuehniKev at # spdbpt18: have to renew the SPD. Join #SPDerneuern and become a member!
. @ KuehniKev at # SPDBPT18: We can make a decision today. But the grand coalition has become both-and-government. This loop has to be broken! pic.twitter.com/00XXJrJpu7
". @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: We are - in the tradition of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt - an international party. And we could now ensure more social justice in Germany &amp; Europe. In my eyes, it would be negligent not to take this opportunity."
. @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: I assure you: We will no longer tolerate cases of breach of contract by the coalition partner - such as full-time return rights or glyphosate!
". @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: We were not able to assert ourselves everywhere. Permanent contracts again as a rule, an end to 2-tier medicine, a hardship rule for family reunification - we will fight for these things in coalition negotiations!"
". @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: The SPD, as a left-wing People&#39;s Party, must prevent the withdrawn conservative mainstream from prevailing in a government. We now have the opportunity to do so. Other parties are masters of speaking! We are masters in design!"
. @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: The most effective means against anti-democrats and right-wing agitators is and remains lifelike politics. We have to focus on people&#39;s specific everyday worries. Only with such a policy can we regain trust!
". @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: Right governments in Poland, Hungary, Austria - we can break the right wave in Europe by forming a stable government with a clearly social democratic profile!"
". @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: Time is short. If we want to make a difference in and for Europe, we cannot wait years. Europe needs us Social Democrats!"
". @ MartinSchulz at # SPDBPT18: I am particularly proud of the European chapter in the exploratory paper. The chapter means nothing less than a historical political change, a new departure for Europe. And it clearly bears a social democratic signature!"
