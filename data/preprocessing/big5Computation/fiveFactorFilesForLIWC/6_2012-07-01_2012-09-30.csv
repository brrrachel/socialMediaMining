@JanHemme good man!
@ henningtillmann your handbag is not blue
@hschmidt @kohlmeierspd I take care that @Schmidtlepp is no longer angry with the SPD.
@ Henningtillmann the black clothes look good on you
@annmeiritz maybe @Schmidtlepp tells me.
"@henningtillmann @kohlmeierspd @annmeiritz ok, already thought there would have been differences in one topic."
@annmeiritz well in the network I still can not find an answer to the question &quot;why&quot;. but then I&#39;ll read it right away.
meet tonight the former president of east timor and Nobel Peace Prize winner josé ramos-horta. I&#39;m really excited.
dear @annmeiritz when is there an article on spon that will clarify what was going on today on the # pc12?
@schneidercar congratulations!

great performance from HSV!
@vonKlaeden @joernpl well we discuss that again beyond the 140 characters. I&#39;m gone now.
@ vonKlaeden have already read .. where do you get the optimism that the SPD is for the #lsr?
@neina_hh have fun
@neina_hh then you&#39;d rather believe asv. and you can see that the parties change their minds also with the pirates (copyright).
@neina_hh lsr was resolved.
"@neina_hh @hildwin yes, saw the pirate reform ideas on copyright. not very progressive. Unfortunately."
@salomon_alex @christiansoeder is the official position of the faction.
@hildwin @neina_hh;)
@neina_hh exciting what you want to read. i am not against copyright. We reject it.
@presroi we see no need for a new property right.
@henningtillmann @nico HSV &amp; FCB hand in hand for beautiful football!
"@neina_hh we don&#39;t need a new property right. if copyright instruments don&#39;t work, you have to talk about them."
@Nico thought that was also tactic to irritate BVB.
@Nico without question.
spd parliamentary group rejects #lsr. Basta. # PC12
@Nico definitely. and BVB has started rather poorly so far.
@Nico all the best for HSV. you do that !!!!
@soerenbartol congratulations. very good result!
@BoehningB what do we think?
stop talking so bad about the CDU. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok. @hildwin: I am in the company of confused people. #Berlin
