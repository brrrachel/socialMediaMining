@ abbeyroadfab4 &quot;Greenovate&quot; has been brought together from &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;innovate&quot;. SME is bureaucratic for &quot;small and medium-sized enterprises&quot;.
Proposal from the Netherlands: Greenovate vouchers for SMEs.
@sebibrux Durban I (2001) was at least &quot;also&quot; problematic. What I hear about preparing Durban II makes me suspicious.
"At the start of the week, first interview, then election campaign discussion, then to Brussels."
@briankrause Thank you for compassion!
"I&#39;ve been working on emails for hours now, but now I&#39;m closing my office."
Old story retold. Question to Hillary: Why can´t we get tough on China? Hillary: How do you get tough on your banker?
@IDMouratidis How are things going today?
"@ Kajo2009 But Muench is exaggerating. Tactically negative for Merkel, but strategically she can even use it."
"@ Kajo2009 The Muench interview is awesome. Merkel, he says indirectly, is &quot;neutral or very flexible on questions of values&quot;."
@heinzkamke The most refreshing are good Pole-Mikkers.
@_tillwe_ You asked an interesting question.
Wagenknecht at Tagesschau: No longer brew in the EP because he &quot;has a different opinion than the majority of the left&quot;. Thanks for clarity.
@Volker_Beck I read the same thing with Ms. Steinbach. Withdrawal is not a problem for her now!
@briankrause The reference to Kreisler is of course correct.
"@heinzkamke Correctly noted, Fischer sang Kreisler. But what is the answer to the question?"
Tim Fischer (bar of all reason): what kind of ticker is a politician? Hard question.
"@renefischer If you find the stolen laptop (in India!), you can exploit all scandals that you find on it. :-)"
"@renefischer Where do you think! Organizational stuff, correspondence and photos."
@hensch Exactly.
Just think of that: Pres. Obama made a `courtesy call´ to George W. Bush before announcing his Iraq withdrawal plan!
My last laptop was stolen. Now the new one is here. Warning to potential thieves: stay away! Otherwise reason for contesting Europe.
@khkarch Thank you for adding it so nicely.
Photo shooting may be exhausting! But Rebecca looks really good.
@armselig I see it that way too.
"In the Steinbach controversy, I understand why several voices cultivate the conflict; but don&#39;t lose all sides?"
@gruenenrw Stefan Kohler&#39;s move from Dena to RWE is not a turning point. It&#39;s been coming for a long time. Some always fall by the way.
@nouripour Congrats! For that I have an alpine panorama.
"@KarlKeule Thank you, I hope so too."
"@Ralf_Stegner grace, twitter priest! From time to time, for clarity, it is also necessary to gradually produce the thoughts when formulating them."
"niece Oeke, without Oeko!"
Now from Prien am Chiemsee with train to Berlin. Oeke lasts. Good thing I have the small mobile office with me.
@seereuber: No fundamentally different view. But from B. multifaceted picture.
"@JanSeifert: give the wankers hell, Anthony"
@seereuber: which argument from Koch in terms of Brender do you find particularly flimsy?
Rosenheim: That’s nice on regional television: time for a real interview instead of just sound bites. Plus mountain view!
"@khkarch Not bad, the woodpecker."
@sven_giegold Do you know Lamfalussy&#39;s proposals for European financial supervision? Rating?
"@ abbeyroadfab4 was not a test, site was correct."
@GRUENE_BaWue: how many people were there on Ash Wednesday?
Now write Ash Wednesday speech. Possible topic would be &quot;Fasting is green&quot;. A little too Catholic.
Very good Muenchau in FTD: &quot;The invisible lady and her snappy companion&quot;.
Good news: Solar cells cost - says First Solar - less than 1 dollar per watt. Grid parity in sight.
@ Zeitrafferin: And you could test who notices that one or the other speech was from the year before last.
@ abbeyroadfab4: Did you mean 1 Corinthians 13:13?
"Ash Wednesday different: Speakers can be called up from the virtual room, on-site mixing is quick according to the mood of the audience. Would be funnier."
"@ abbeyroadfab4: &quot;It should also work without hope, because there is an opportunity every day to do something sensible.&quot; (Josef B.)"
"Chance of a GND for Eastern Europe: resource efficiency is still poor there (Schepelmann, Wuppertal Institute)."
Tarek not to Berlin. Too bad. Call to him was not unanimous. Will he repeat himself in four years? I doubt it.
Steinbach&#39;s preliminary half-retreat continues the torture by other means. The conservat was missing for clarity. apparently the strength.
@seereuber Let&#39;s see what the GND papers are at the conference.
"@Kai_Klose What are you talking about, your first speech?"
Discussion was good yesterday with German students at Sciences Po in Nancy. Now go back to Brussels - Green New Deal.
Clinton&#39;s commitment to 2-state solution Isr./Palaest. worth little without a new attitude of the USA to isr. Settlement policy.
taz finds it remarkable that &quot;traffic light&quot; is not included in the good election program. waer
"At the 8 finalists for Europe&#39;s green capital with HH, Muenster, Frbg.i.Br. three German cities! Conclud. green local politics."
"@sebibrux I have no definitive opinion about Durban II, I haven&#39;t studied the draft text. Possibly. also a question of EU unity."
Place Stanislas in Nancy - very impressive backdrop!
"Now with Thalys to Paris, on to Nancy. Lecture there at the university."
"Join @ abbeyroadfab4 Gruen? Not because we are so great, even though we are historically correct, but because it makes us better."
The strong attendance at the event is surprising. The inevitable Jo Linen again semi-depressed.
Europa Union event in Brussels
@ Timelapse Buetikofer band?
@Volker_Beck: Speaking of carnival - where did my polar bear costume go?
@sebastianfricke: &quot;Crises can only be solved by preparing bigger ones.&quot; Who said that?
"Was in the Pergamon Museum today, so I completely missed the deep fall in the ifo index. How do I get back to crisis temperature?"
@GRUENE_BaWue: and I also want to read from Arvid.
"@Samuel_Raz: have a number of election goals: 13 German Greens to the EP again, at least CSU out; Popularize Green New Deal; Barroso gone."
"@Nadim_A: 1. Talking and talking is two different things. 2. Merkel&#39;s mistake was also not talking, but: wrong symbolism, wrong tone."
@inet_k: with a little help from my friend...
"@gruenernomade: if Rebecca and I and all of our great candidates swirl properly, it will definitely be 5% better."
@Samuel_Raz: What does it mean to be? Didn&#39;t you notice that I&#39;m a top candidate (for European elections)? I guess I have to get Trara there. ;-)
"@time lapse: no, no, no, no anti-top candidate polemic here; at some point this will affect me too!"
@ Zeitrafferin: A Facebook group &quot;I don&#39;t want to become a minister&quot; would be even more fun. Who would participate?
"@_tillwe_ @zeitrafferin Yes, but. In my memory under 50% of the haul of small donations."
@ Zeitrafferin: I doubt that Obama got so much about small donations. Information possibly at www.fivethirtyeight.com
"@ Kajo2009: colleague, please do not be naive. Strategists do not stand."
@ Kajo2009: Super tactics - loudly request from Merkel to make it harder for her to say something. Perpetuum mobile of politics.
"@themroc picture is still coming, got one already."
@IDMouratidis: Election campaign commission on Shrove Monday IS foolish.
My mobile &quot;office&quot; is just in the &quot;bright spot&quot; again. Bureaucratic normality is better.
Schroeder&#39;s meeting with Akhmadinejad certainly hurts. But Klaeden is also harmful!
"@Ralf_Stegner: Donnermeyer, who wants to create the carbon dioxide according to SH, is a pillion! The left does not want what the right does. Typical."
"@Ralf_Stegner: Not so toxic, my dear, you want to traffic lights with us - right?"
More than 60 German Green delegates to the Congress of European Greens will discuss the remaining changes to the EP election manifesto.
Over lunch with Rebecca and German journalists: The logic of an EU election campaign and the EU logic are very different.
Interesting: according to Politbarometer 2/3 of the Gruenwaehler residents against subsidizing Opel.
@ abbeyroadfab4 The EGP is chaired by Ulrike Lunacek (Austr. AUSTR) and Philippe Lamberts (Belgium.
"Having arrived in Brussels, I am looking forward to the Congress of the European Greens. And media response."
@svenlehmann With FDP and Left Party to HRE committee of inquiry.
@ platz13 This is much better than a joke. That is the reality. :-)
I have never seen anything like this that has been sabotaged so ruthlessly.
Minimal attendance at press conference on the Green Europe campaign - because BundestagGrüne invited to a competing PK at short notice. ...
... and now Berlin again.
"you should follow @zeitrafferin, @_tillwe_,  and @K_SA. 7 more picks at  http://twibes.com/?r=T1"
After the European election campaign in Stade and the surrounding area yesterday in Cuxhaven. It is snowing heavily.
Just drive four-span with the European carriage over the Oste.

European discussion at the Kreuzberg high school center with 90 vocational students - in the end the clear majority seemed to be interested.

"@Ralf_Stegner: So everyone won - in football the black and green HH is in front, in Celle the SPD. ;-)"
I hope for a grand coalition under Netanyahu because that is the most likely to drive the inner Israeli contradictions.
@IDMouratidis: Why not just circulate what&#39;s happening? Transparency is often a weapon:
Has anyone ever played www.wurzelimperium.de? Is it eco?
@DowningStreet: great news that Gordon is getting an early invite by Barack; but how about answering questions?
"Hooray, I&#39;m an LDK replacement delegate for Berlin Mitte! Many voices."
@Volker_Beck: and what follows from the concern about Netanyahu and Lieberman?
"@K_SA: Even if I am not a Twitter acquaintance, I would be happy to have a meal with you when I am in Hesse."
@DowningStreet: What proposals will the PM put on the table in Berlin? What about hedge fonds and rating agencies?
"Great harmony in elections in the Mitte district association. However, none of the OVs Brussels and Washington ran."
"Something like that, my spam filter actually caught an internship application. Just noticed."
"@zeitrafferin After two years with Renate in the party council, you are fully qualified as a Facebook friend."
I met a head of the carnival association and still come home with a good tie.

@zeitrafferin There was a traffic light flickering lighter from the traffic light government in BB. It&#39;s broken for a long time.
Today I&#39;m going to the botanical garden. My tree is blooming.
@ Zeitrafferin: the political traffic light should work differently than the traffic lights - the three colors should light up at the same time.
@Volker_Beck as they say: learn from the pros
Just sit with Julia Seeliger and she explains twitter to me.
