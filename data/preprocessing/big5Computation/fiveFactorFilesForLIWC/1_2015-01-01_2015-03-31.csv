@Pausanias But hello!
@Kanzlerpark I wrote you a letter! Many greetings!
@JochenEurope should go now ...
The JU-Saar has a birthday and is as young and for young as ever! Congratulations @ 60yearsJU-Saar @_A_K_K_ @uhl_markus
@erhardrenz Gähhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnn ....
@HugoMuellerVogg @CDU_Hamburg The small but nice difference: The CDU is a people&#39;s party and wants to stay that way!
"@Herr_Decker @CDU_Hamburg Oh, well then, so yes"
@MariaBoehmer Welcome to Twitter! Now the AA is finally unbeatable!
"@HugoMuellerVogg @CDU_Hamburg If I see it correctly, we won&#39;t put the OB anywhere ..."
@Herr_Decker @CDU_Hamburg Why not? I am often there and know the people and topics.
That wasn&#39;t really the day of @cdu_hamburg! We have fought with you and will do so in the future: Until we are a big city party again in HH!
@SissiSinatra Then I felt prepared for the toughest negotiation!
@ jenny78 But something of! super nice people and great atmosphere!
@SimonGottowik @SissiSinatra @ stefbec91 The editorial team also documented the fool&#39;s court very well! The selfies are well deserved! :-)
"@Herr_Decker Yes, several times! There&#39;s a slice of meatloaf down there as big as bricks!"
@UllkeWeido They didn&#39;t think of it: They were convinced that I would swallow my coalition partners !!! :-))
"Back from #narrengericht Stockach. Great idea, great people: Germsny at it&#39;s best !!!"
@socialhubBT It&#39;s clear: I&#39;m still partying! The mildest judgment in the history of the court! :-)
@SissiSinatra If it had been that easy! I was under constant observation and fogging! :-)
Halftime at the Stockacher fool&#39;s dish: one executioner&#39;s meal after another! :-)
@Honourstone I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t prepare for the #fool&#39;s judgment! :-))
@Schmidtlepp Well. When you quit on Twitter ...
@flueke @maltespitz every child knows that: that&#39;s where Honecker and Lafo come from!
@maltespitz is not a church asylum :-)
"@Herr_Decker Of course, I can only afford the shop sporadically ..."
"I only accept the offer if I am allowed to rule to my heart for 1 day. It will work out, the people of Württemberg are not so spoiled!"
Landed in Stuttgart: MP-Kretschmann offers me asylum in Villa Reizenstein until the court hearing is over. #Narrengericht
"@Ralf_Stegner Yes, I think so, too, if you&#39;re not getting into a social group!"
I feel very bad. Get away if you haven&#39;t eaten for half an hour! # Fool&#39;s Court #Stockach
@Morshu_ :-))
The Berlin Senate has switched all traffic lights to red and closed the airport - they are doing everything to save me! # Fool&#39;s judgment
Now set off to Stockach in Berlin: Citizens worried everywhere who fear for my fate! #Narrengericht
@sumpfspalte It&#39;s over again! :-)
@sumpfspalte Internet and social media such as Twitter prevent Russia from completely sealing itself off. Power of words greater than violence.
@Schmidtlepp I&#39;m afraid you have a bot that repeats the tweet periodically.
"Today Stockacher fool&#39;s court! Can @sigmargabriel represent me? If locked up, I send 1 box of general cookies once a month!"
@seechat Please have mercy on me tomorrow - I can only sleep 3 hours tonight!
"@nostrx Very much, but unfortunately I have to be in Berlin on Monday - as on all working days!"
@ Beethoven1770 You make up for it with your witty tweets ...
Right in Bergedorf! @DennisGladiator is a great candidate who is worth the effort!
"@Morshu_ Sorry, but you shouldn&#39;t drink tea anymore at the time! :-)"
"@SaschaSauther Looking forward to seeing you again! If I remember correctly, you were also present at the last event!"
@BundCBerlin I&#39;m also more often on the street: I will be careful in the future! :-)
@BundCBerlin Oh.
@SaarThomas Long live Saarland!
"@Rakkox goodness idea. I am very concerned with the Digi topic ..,"
@AndreasAusBS A single one. But Austrian bucket size!
"@HolgerScherer yes, already! That is it ! : /)"
@rotes_tuch I&#39;m happy!
@ThoborUlrike Exactly! :-)
@lisa_galvagno Only for You ... :-)
@ JBJones72 :-))
@b_muenzer That will turn out soon enough!
@opilef Thanks back!
@Braun_Lisa :-))
@genenano Likewise!
@StefanWallukat Theoretically: Yes. Practical: a blink of an eye!
@Rakkox I remember: haven&#39;t seen you in the main station in a long time!
@kjuka thank you!
"Speaking of which: I wish everyone a Happy New Year, even if it&#39;s almost over again! :-)"
