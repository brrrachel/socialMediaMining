How bitter it must be to be in jail on his birthday. Think Deniz Yücel. And the others innocent in d. Turkey detainees.
The fact that Inge Deutschkron was there today moved me deeply. It embodies why we cannot take a step away from the right-wing agitators. pic.twitter.com/ldoOfTGRmT

In 7 days we can get excited that right-wing agitators are sitting in the Bundestag. Or we can use these 7 days to prevent that.

Will Heiner Geißler be remembered as a unique political figure. He was a quarrelsome spirit and a clever analyst.

"Horst Seehofer tactically plays with topics and therefore with people. But politics is not a game, it is a question of attitude."
Finally Bundesliga again! Wish us all a nice and peaceful season. Keep my fingers crossed for my FC today. :)
Akhanli&#39;s release is good news! Erdogan&#39;s arm must not reach into the EU.
"Why do our daughters Ø 21% receive less wages than our sons? It makes me angry as a father. As Chancellor, I want to change that."
Akhanli&#39;s arrest is a scandal. President Erdogan&#39;s behavior has become paranoid. Need a clear European answer.
One less dangerous man in the White House ...
Erdogan has lost all dimensions. We are all the more at the side of all those who are fighting for a free and democratic Turkey.
Shocked by the news of Barcelona. A cowardly attack on our values! My thoughts are with the victims and their families.
You definitely have to face Nazis. What Trump is doing is extremely dangerous. Those who downplay violence and hate betray the values of the West!
Migration is the norm in our history and not a special case. People should determine their future - not their origin.
Need a well-equipped military - but no Trump-style upgrade! Money that Mrs. Merkel wants for rearmament has to go to education!
"I just discussed with a nurse, a police officer, a family and a pensioner. Runs on RTL tonight at 10:20 p.m."
"Merkel rejects quotas for electric cars, but has no own proposal. The future of mobility is not shaped by refusing to accept politics!"
Those who work hard deserve a good pension. And this country deserves a chancellor who has a concept for it and who finally acts.
"We want the quota for electric cars. This is how we create the right incentives for innovation, environmental protection and secure jobs."
If Trump rhetorically matches the level of the North Korean. Approaching dictators only aggravates the conflict. Must rely on de-escalation!
Proud of my team! Together we fight for more justice. pic.twitter.com/n4XBtT5fhB

It&#39;s good that Sigmar Gabriel found such clear words about Erdogan! Erdogan is not Turkey. But his policy needs a clear answer.
Uncriminated Germans become hostages to Erdogan politics in Turkey. The Chancellor can not just take that in with a shrug.
Erdogan raves about &quot;chopping off the traitors&quot; and arrests other Germans. How long will Merkel keep silent?
The Mediterranean cannot be a mass grave. Have to distribute refugees fairly in the EU. I will make German payments to the EU dependent on this.
"At the last 9 European Championships, the German soccer players have won the title 8 times. Now it&#39;s 9. Press the thumb!"
First Seehofer presents the CDU and now the CSU program. These are not sister parties. These are distant-related parties!
I wouldn't have gone there. This is not politics.
Anyone who needs an ID in Estonia can go online. In Germany you have to go to the office. This does not work this way. Digital administration now!
We have to use our economic power to invest in the future! Whoever gives wealth gifts to wealthy people is wasting opportunities.
"Today I presented my plan for the future: Obligation to invest for the state, account for people, EU budget as a solidarity pact."
I will present my future plan tomorrow. Because waiting and doing nothing means missing opportunities. We can do more from this country.

"15 years after G. Schröders No to the Iraq war, our country is facing a directional decision. CDU &amp; CSU rely on armament, we on disarmament"
Schröder&#39;s No to the Iraq War exactly 15 years ago is a glory sheet in the history of Germany &amp; the SPD. Today applies: No to the upgrade logic
"Car makers have to pay, not customers. That is an imperative of justice! #Dieselgipfel"

"Think a lot today about talking to refugees &amp; helpers in Catania yesterday. We have to help Italy, we need European solidarity."
I just went to representatives of Italy in Catania. Coast Guard &amp; NGOs thanked for their great work in refugee rescue.
I agree with the Italian MP Paolo Gentiloni: We need a solidary refugee policy in Europe! Must help Italy.
Italy needs help among refugees through a coalition of the willing. So meet the Italian Prime Minister Gentiloni today.
"The ECJ judgment shows that we have to help Italy quickly. And in addition to secure external borders, we finally need legal routes to Europe."
"I thank the police, the fire brigade and all helpers who are deployed in the areas affected by the flood."
Am with my thoughts to those affected and helpers in the flood areas. Now the rule is: get everyone involved!
I welcome Poland&#39;s President Duda&#39;s veto of judicial reform. Resistance of tens of thousands of democrats is effective!

Just on the phone with GdP boss Malchow: SPD is in solidarity behind HH forces. I thanked him for many police officers.
"We have to thank the police officers. Under the most difficult circumstances, you risked life and limb to defend our constitutional state."
The pictures from Hamburg are staggering. Randale has nothing to do with politics. The violent criminals must be held responsible.
"Marriage for everyone is through the Federal Council. Now the president has to sign, then from October 1st, 2017 all couples can finally get married."
You didn&#39;t have to share every position of Cardinal Meisner. But his lifelong commitment to his church demands a lot of respect from me.
Manuela Schwesig will be an excellent prime minister for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Congratulations on your choice!
"It&#39;s a good thing that the CDU &amp; CSU presented their program today. Unfortunately, it promotes injustice &amp; armament. Now everyone has a choice!"

The European state act for Helmut Kohl was sad and solemn at the same time - appropriate for a great European. Rest in peace.
