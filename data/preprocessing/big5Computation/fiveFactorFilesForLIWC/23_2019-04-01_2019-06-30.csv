I think I&#39;m in the #forest! The State Secretary says in the Agriculture Committee: we can&#39;t do without #pesticides in the forest.
Ahem. Is this your voluntary campaign or the result of a European court decision? # question friend # reason @MartinHaeusling

"With all due respect, the text is too immanent in the thinking of the #AfD. The question of what that means for the representation of the 1st internal and external violence is missing. Dealing with the principle that #MdB is only responsible for their own #conscience is missing. Should I choose the &quot;We&#39;ll hunt them&quot;?"
That&#39;s the way it is. Especially when you look at criminal offenses online.
