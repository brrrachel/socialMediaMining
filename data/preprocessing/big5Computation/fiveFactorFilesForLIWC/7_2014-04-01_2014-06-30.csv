We will not let the CDU go through the fact that it is silent before elections as to whether it wants to coalition with the right-wing AFD. &quot;Red socks&quot; - there was something!
"Before the state elections in Thuringia + Saxony, the CDU must clearly tell voters whether it wants to coalition with right-wing populist AFD."
Black logic: Gutschker transfigured Merkel&#39;s jiggle course at Juncker as a strategic feat and gave SPD + Schulz another one.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung worries about the CSU and says that without their hegemony the republic would be missing something. Hardly likely!
"Interview with the second Ms. Kohl reveals, above all, a simple view of the world from evil sauces and great black people. Black money? Peanuts."
"Ms. Steinbach advocates coalitions from CDU + AFD: The black cat is let out of the bag! Any clear stance, Ms. Merkel?"

@MGrosseBroemer the person who inherits the inheritance as an asset has not taxed it; taxing less than work is unfair.
"Inheritance is (mostly) inefficient income, if not the public prosecutor comes, so tax properly in the interest of the common good!"
I think reforms are good when they improve the lives of many people and they have to pay more who can afford it!
"For some, good reforms mean taking something away from many so that profits become less."
"Still anti-Juncker tirades in Sunday press. Dear mousekeepers, before the European Parliament gets involved, democracy disrupts neo-liberal agenda"

Perhaps the game is just a little bit of poker until reason wins - the reasonableness of people is quite inexhaustible.

Just a quick interview for ZDF Today&#39;s news about retirement - now keep your fingers crossed for HSV in F√ºrth!
@ 13DX110 @ca_fink @doktorkohlThe investigations by the prosecutors at that time led to the result that all allegations were completely without substance!

More development cooperation in the sense of the Millennium Goals instead of records for arms exports - that must be German politics!
"With arms exports approved by the previous government, polemics against Sigmar Gabriel are unfair, but practice must change!"

"Oh yes: voting right in the European elections is not possible at all, whether AFD, NPD, FP√ñ, Front Nationale, Orb√°n, Berlusconi, Wilders or just Mr. F."
"Just as Mr. Ferber from the CSU rushes against Martin Schulz and scourges Frank Steinmeier&#39;s efforts to relax, AFD &amp; Co."
"If that should happen in F√ºrth on Sunday, the HSV has to put a whole lot more on it. Brave fight instead of fear football!"

Seehofer says we shouldn&#39;t be so upset about the Union&#39;s right-wing populist attacks against Martin Schulz. They have to be nervous.
So-called Junge Alternative NRW insults Martin Schulz in the manner of the old and new Nazis. Disgusting campaigns are self-directed!
"One can argue about the performances at the ESC circus, but not about the indisputable discrimination against homosexuals in Putin&#39;s Russia."
Klaas H√ºbner from the FES manager group stands together with the CDU against Andrea Nahles&#39; pension policy and the SPD. Single opinion.

CDU legal interpreter wants to become mayor in H√∂xter. FAS writes with recognizable sympathy about NDS ex-interior minister Uwe Sch√ºnemann.

"Matthias Matussek&#39;s WAMS play &quot;Herr Schulz&quot; is worth reading despite some condescending, dubious characterization of Martin + accompaniment."

Encouraging TV duel for European elections. Anyone who has seen this and judges with reason + heart will choose Martin Schulz and the SPD.
@ArminLaschet @MartinSchulz @JunckerEU Schulz was so much stronger than Juncker that you have to console yourself with Steinmeier praise.
@petertauber @JunckerEU Now don&#39;t just put Merkel instead of Juncker and then he should speak even better German than Schulz!

"My own people and the sweaty opposition suffered from my &quot;dominance&quot; in SH, disagreement with the CDU was resolved, says Kubicki."
Kubicki certifies that I want to do politics in SH alone - weeks ago he thought I was completely without influence.
"According to agency reports, according to FDP Kubicki, one can talk about nuclear power again. SH pirates, whom he called the &quot;crawling group&quot;, were serious."
Mistakes like a subclass amateur club - the HSV professionals obviously have no idea what it&#39;s about - big crap is that !!!!!
Incredibly bad - the HSV will descend - that simply cannot be true. Creepy sack in Augsburg and HSV like a relegation!
The HSV&#39;s performance is out of the question. 1: 3 back in Augsburg is catastrophic - they want to relegate ???? Unbelievable failure of well-paid professionals!

Prudence is required! ‚Äú@Tagesspiegel_de: # Ukraine crisis: #Steinmeier indirectly warns of # war. # Federal Government http://ow.ly/wwfAo ‚Äù
A free trade agreement can be good for growth and jobs - but not as a Trojan horse of predator capitalism.
@csommer that ensures a certain serenity towards the digital world ;-)
&quot;This is not about life and death - it is worse&quot;. Many things that &quot;shake&quot; SH remind me of Peer Steinbr√ºck&#39;s favorite quote.
"During the Easter break, some chilled their little mothers. It is good that the focus is now on material work again. Head shaking."
Public war rhetoric on the question of contemporary teacher training in SH is as inappropriate as it is inappropriate. Parliament decides!
"I understand such demands against North Korea, but not against the Federal Republic of Germany!"
The notion that international corporations need to be protected against democratically legitimate parliamentary decisions is adventurous!
@DLF @bdi But not against democratically legitimate parliaments!

@Sascha__Michel @dneuerer put massive pressure on trying to handle L√ºbeck medicine - not the SPD.
"@Sascha__Michel @dneuerer can decide that of course the university itself, but criticism of it is allowed in a free country, right?"
"It is cheeky, however, that the CDU &amp; FDP declare this a strategy today and the almost university killers act as avengers of the (university) disinherited."
"An embarrassing silence would be right, not a public celebration of this event, which has brought thousands onto the street against black and yellow."
"At the behest of Ms. Merkel, Ms. Schavan was supposed to go out with Carstensen &amp; Kubicki after her wrecking ball at the University of L√ºbeck. Great performance!"
"Role model for science, merits for Uni L√ºbeck as a reason for an honorary doctorate or rather unsuccessful rescue act for black and yellow in SH?"
Embarrassing process today at the University of L√ºbeck: Doctorate lost by court order - now honorary doctorate for Ms. Schavan and then the Vatican.

Kiel is still gray - whether the sun will come out for the state debate?
@DirkDiedrich some create more substance in 140 characters than others in 30 minutes of speech ;-)
"A little more: We have the following substantial counter-suggestions and a little less &quot;Mom, they are so mean to us&quot; ....."
Only controversial debate also means: arguments instead of larmoyance and at least a little factual knowledge instead of fact-free claims.
"I think that passionate, controversial discussion is part of democracy; we have too little of it rather than too much!"
@DerBruesseler i wo- the press can write what it wants as long as politics doesn&#39;t have to do what it writes ;-)

Even a culture of dialogue could be identified with a clear view. But it also applies: &quot;We are liberal but not stupid.&quot;
The differences between black and yellow minority politics and today could be understood by looking at the facts.
Some observers would like to once again explain the difference between systematic abuse of power and legitimate advocacy.
"We are accused of media-cold power politics &quot;like in old times&quot; in SH. LRH President, judge elections? Like back then ???? Amnesia!"
I wish you all and especially the troubled opposition politicians in SH (coalition in the &quot;Putin style&quot;) a magical Thursday ;-)

"@DerBruesseler, in any case, you are not outing yourself as an education expert with your tweets"
The black and yellow fast killers from the University of L√ºbeck are swinging to avenge the (university) disinherited: this is not opposition but satire!
Putin&#39;s comparison of Mr. Callsen shows the whole misery of the opposition in SH. But we can&#39;t help there either ;-)
"Heiko Maas is right: we need a common European approach, no German solo efforts with a questionable legal basis!"
Current hour for data retention: The crystal-clear ruling of the European Court of Justice loses the basis for German law.
