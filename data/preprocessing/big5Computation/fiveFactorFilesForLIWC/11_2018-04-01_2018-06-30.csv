What are these followers who are added and then withdrawn? Do not understand the (possible) idea behind it. Team Beer
"I summarize again: There was real agitation under the hashtag, they wanted to regain their sovereignty again, so they got involved in the discussion using the hashtag, and were the algorithm unwanted &quot;banned&quot; from the algorithm, so to speak?"
Why do you think it is that criticism of Islam or Saudi Arabia in particular leads to shadowbanning? Because the tweets / topics are reported more often or because it&#39;s a decision by Twitter? Team Beer
What do you mean by that? Team Beer

"I apologize, the tweet was wrong, I wouldn&#39;t have sent it, political opponents should be allowed to be fought, but even if the opponent tries to attract attention through provocation &amp; tastelessness, the FDP needs the good nursery to some extent."

"Dear Mr. Mees, the discussion about the meaning and nonsense of these lists also runs on the Discord Server. Likewise, the dispute as to whether RI is politically neutral or not (in my opinion naively believing RI is neutral). Purpose does not justify means. RI does not accept criticism of this."
"This is simply untrue, the discussion about the sense and nonsense of these lists is also held on the Discord Server."
"As already explained, the discussion about the sense or nonsense of these lists also runs on the Discord Server."
"That is exactly the point: you can only solve these problems in political discourse. Blocking and sparring does not advance the political discourse, but solidifies the filter bubbles. But public criticism is not accepted by RI."
"That&#39;s the point. To use the same critical means in the fight against law, but not to accept criticism of it."
"The criticism of these lists also runs on the Discord Server. Centrally non-transparent blacklists do not advance political discourse, but criticism of them is not accepted by RI. Too bad."
Do you know that FDP members are also on the black lists?
The controversy as to whether RI is neutral is still on the Discord server. There is a falling apart between desire (= code) and reality. The idea that RI is politically neutral is naive.
"What I have already said everywhere: We condemn blacklists / blocklists, whether from the right or the left, they do not continue in the political discourse."
That is exactly the problem. RI does not accept criticism of the choice of funds. This discussion also runs on the Discord Server. The wave of indignation here is uncritical and incapable of self-reflection. This is a pity.
"The end does not justify the means. You also have the criticism and discussion about lists on the Discord Server, as well as a discussion of whether RI is politically neutral or not (in my opinion naive, of course RI is not neutral). Criticism of RI funds is generally not accepted."
