@uellenauer_ger There was a life stream broadcast of the Barroso appearance. One would have to go through this.
"Now to climate: Hassi, Turmes, Jadot. Turmes: attacks him sharply because he weakens BusinessEurope to please climate policy."
"#Barroso: Say market economy, not capitalism. is the same. (Maybe he was a Maoist, but certainly not a Marxist.)"
... consisted mainly of neo-liberal people. Why should she set the tone? #Barroso
... control messages? Lunacek: why not a word about Tobin tax? Staes: Larossiere Commission ...
"Canfin an #Barroso: capitalism, tax paradise, tax harmonization does not occur with you. Are they for automatic ..."
Now phrases come from #Barroso: &quot;my honest answer to a very difficult question&quot;.
"If he gets specific technical questions, #Barroso comes alive. Routine."
W. Schulz to #Barroso: will Nabucco accelerate Turkey&#39;s accession?
#Barroso to Rivasi: yes we have problems with turnout. But that is not just a problem for the Commission. Attacks nation. Politicians
Tarand (Latvia): attacks Postenschacher on commission. #Barroso
"#Barroso, attacked for courting British Conservatives, attacks Chris Patten. Dany: it was good!"
#Barroso: complains about &quot;character murder&quot;. Part of my role is to please a little everyone.
#Barroso: who I am? Brings the coalition for Europe together.
"Questions from me, Lamberts and Lichtenberger about credibility and leadership. &quot;What are you?&quot; #Barroso"
"#Barroso: You should fight against nationalism, not against me. Rebecca and Dany: call the selfishness by name! then we will be there"
Dany catches Barroso at McCreevy: gunshot! #Barroso
#Barroso: low praise for greens - a few good contributions. Talks about climate policy: I&#39;m the good one (and McCreevy).
#Barroso: better than criticizing my past would be to believe my promises. I also acted well in a crisis.
Rebecca criticizes the Commission&#39;s Lisbon strategy. Crisis didn&#39;t come like a storm. Relationship between market and state? #Barroso
Rebecca criticizes that climate policy is too hesitant and stingy about the south of the world. #Barroso
"Now Rebecca: Why has European politics lost its enthusiasm since 2004? For example, for errors by the Commission: Bolkestein directive."
Dany wants to argue with Barroso and chair the meeting. Takes a little longer. #Barroso
"... until Vaclav Klaus accepts Lisbon. Dany: Excuse me, V. Klaus can&#39;t stop Lisbon for long, #Barroso"
#Barroso: Don&#39;t want to be a care taker. You have to support me if you want a strong Europe. We cannot wait with a new commission
Dany: why does #Barroso want to be elected after the Nice Treaty if he is so much for the Lisbon Treaty? Refers to expert opinion Pernice.
