"@gaanzruhig I think it&#39;s going great, why suddenly switch?"
@Der_Wutbuerger @ wahlen_afd_2016 @CheckAFD @faznet It was about an application for detention that was never delivered and a few hundred euros! : D
"@Der_Wutbuerger @ wahlen_afd_2016 @CheckAFD Who &quot;cares&quot; for your thinking? The gossip, yes? : D"
@WahrheitNews @AfDWatchafd @KatharinaKoenig Just out of interest: why should I pay what has long been paid? Tabloids believers?
@Investigoo &quot;financial disaster&quot; with me? Not correct! Did you get that from the gossip press ??? You also believe everything !? :-D
"@WahlenLSA But always believe the gossip, GREAT achievement! ;-)"
"@WahlenLSA Wrong !!! Requests to speak u inquiries in each session, but some non-attendance, but representation in other sessions!"
"@H_Augustin @HendrikMD @mzwebde Rather no &quot;research&quot; otherwise there would not be 2 false claims! In that case, lies press !?"
"@dhelmich To do this he would have to be &quot;insolvent&quot;, but he is not! So only dirty laundry !? ;-)"
"On the day of the commemoration of the victims of National Socialism, the AfD wreath was laid at the &quot;Magda&quot; memorial in Magdeburg."
"@gaanzruhig AfD u I personally stand unequivocally against racism u Merkel has betrayed the German people, what do you actually want?"
"@ChristineGAP First of all I want to see our citizens protected, but not you! Problems of other countries cannot be solved here."
"@ChristineGAP Typical idiotic left-wing thinking. One may, the other may not allegedly stand against the GG. Keep it up ..."
"@ChristineGAP But first please to Ms. Merkel, she doesn&#39;t seem to know it either! Otherwise there would have been no total opening of the border!"

"In Germany there is only one alternative to catastrophic development, the AfD! 20% + X, we can do it! http://m.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150999151/AfD-auf-Rekordkurs-Platz-hinter-CDU-in-Reichbreite.html…"
@wir_lsa @FraukePetry @MDRINFO Clearly: alternative
Budde SPD wants an unholy and undemocratic alliance against AfD in LSA. CDU and FDP issue removal. Does Budde have panic attack in descent?
Anyone who says today &quot;something like this has happened before and has nothing to do with mass immigration&quot; is a miserable liar! http://www.nw.de/lokal/bielefeld/mitte/mitte/20674877_Boulevard-Erschreckender-Bericht-eines-Tuerstehers-zu-den-Silvestervorgaengen.html…
@xtridence @No_zur_AFD Then you have no idea about the terms u want to lump everything together without meaning !?
AfD parliamentary group in SA wins a deputy after irregularities in the counting became known. Now 25 AfD MPs!
@Medienmogul @AfD_Bund Thanks for the hint but this is neither from me nor from the AfD Saxony-Anhalt
"@JayBoettger The &quot;technical questions&quot; were answered, you just don&#39;t like the answers. Typical left-wing agitation again. : D"

"@gamersai_de @Nein_zur_AFD The AfD does not &quot;stigmatize&quot; people based on their appearance or origin, the highest due to their behavior!"
@Chat_Atkins @Nein_zur_AFD yes yes court ... always the same lyre. Let&#39;s hope that the perpetrators from Cologne &amp; Co. come to court!
"@Chat_Atkins @Nein_zur_AFD They already do, with support signatures for the state election! : D"
@ChristineGAP @Funny__Junk The skyrocketing number of sexual assaults has nothing to do with the immigration flood ???
"@ChristineGAP @Funny__Junk No, the AfD has been warning about the consequences of disorderly mass immigration for 2 years, not just now!"
@ChristineGAP @Funny__Junk Oh so ... naming cause and effect is &quot;instrumentalizing&quot;. Really great! Mind Police 3.0
"@ChristineGAP No, they were more immigrants than refugees, right! Mediterranean, according to police and witnesses. Courage to truth! ;-)"
@ChristineGAP @Funny__Junk Do something really what u call the current basic evil by name: disorderly mass immigration!
"@ Korscha8 @ChristineGAP Just because I don&#39;t want to underline &quot;your truth&quot;, yes? : D"
@ChristineGAP @Funny__Junk Strange how you pull yourself up instead of condemning the events on New Year&#39;s Eve with the same verve!
"@ChristineGAP @Funny__Junk It is about the statement behind it and unfortunately that is true, the picture could also be from 1999."
&quot;AfD criticism&quot; so @No_zur_AFD should finally rename itself to &quot;anti-AfD incitement&quot;. Do they have so much &quot;courage to tell the truth&quot;?
"@No_zur_AFD @xtridence I was invited and asked about it, THAT is the truth, even if the left-wing agitators do not like it again."

"@StriegSe The &quot;Greens&quot; already have a role as a victim, even prehistoric rocks it becomes too embarrassing and they run away. AfD is more of a pioneer!"
@JNaglinho @JustusBender Someone wants to be funny and probably has no idea about Facebook !? ;-)
"@JustusBender No explanation known so far why FB account was blocked. Private and politician side away with it, very strange everything ..."
"@Pero_Jebac @merilsell AfD has many topics, including anti-teuro, just have a look at the program. But mass immigration is topical everywhere."
"Facebook account blocked !!! Whatever the reason, I am not aware of any guilt. Probably just too &quot;politically incorrect&quot; ???"
"Alleged &quot;financial disaster&quot; or bad &quot;district council work&quot;, press gossip in its purest form that does not stop the AfD! #mdr #zdfheute #afd"
