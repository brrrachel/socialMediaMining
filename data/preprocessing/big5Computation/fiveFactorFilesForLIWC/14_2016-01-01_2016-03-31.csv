It is imperative that hunters apologize to the victims. #Köln Hbf
In Cologne we experienced a failure of the leadership. The responsible SPD interior minister must take responsibility for this. #Köln Hbf
# NRW Interior Minister Ralf Jäger leaves the police in the rain. This is cowardly and indecent. #Köln Hbf
Warm greetings from #Bavaria on its 10th birthday! What would political debates be without you? #LoveTwitter https://t.co/bQiHR2LxVR
Great mourning for Guido Westerwelle. He left us much too early.
The survey numbers are a clear confirmation of our course. Thank you for your citizens&#39; support for our policy of reason.
"The @CSU grows, the AfD remains single-digit, and in #Bavaria there are clear majority relationships instead of complicated alliances."
"The @sat1bayern poll shows: In #Bavaria, the #Landtag elections would have been very different than in the other countries. https://t.co/fRTqkRwbvV"
#EU must take a clear stance on human rights deficits and press freedom in # Turkey. Turkey is doing wrong development.
"The @CSU sticks to its position: We can talk to # Turkey about relief, but not about complete # visa-free travel."
"RT @CSU: The consistent answer of the parties standing for election today must be at the federal level: Yes, we understand! # wahlen2016"
RT @CSU: The @CSU will stick to its clear course of limiting the inflow. #wahlen2016 #Ländagswahlen https://t.co/Z5WpNqziT0
Today on election campaign tour in Ba-Wü - For a strong south! #Election campaign https://t.co/Tuqz6lBvCG
@Sigmargabriel&#39;s arrogance towards our neighboring countries damages Europe and damages Germany.
. @ sigmargabriel obviously wants exclusion and boycott of talks in Europe instead of looking for solutions together.
Gabriel&#39;s contribution to solving the refugee crisis consists of confused zigzag actions and inexplicable spending programs.
Panic spreads before the SPD state elections. Criticism of Seehofer&#39;s trip to #Orban is nonsense.
RT @CSU: The reform of the #inheritance tax must not be at the expense of medium-sized companies and their employees.
RT @CSU: The #CSU is interested in solutions. It stays that way! #Inheritance tax https://t.co/833TLvBLpH
"CSU remains a persistent but reliable partner in the BReg. In contrast to the SPD, we have adhered to all coalition agreements"
Mr. Oppermann shouldn&#39;t worry about the CSU in a common union.
This is a tactical game before the #Landtag elections on March 13th and red-green will get a receipt for it on election day. #Asylum
"The red-green strategy of expanding safer countries of origin to include Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia again leads to a loss of time."
Red-green wants a right of residence for those who shouldn&#39;t be in Germany for a long time. The signal is fatal. #Asylum
# Asylum package2: This is the right step to limit the number of refugees.
Nothing stands in the way of the rapid implementation of the # Asylum Package2. One can only say: Finally and long overdue!
"As already decided, there is a hardship case regulation only in justified exceptional cases. # Asylpaket2"
"The CSU has prevailed. The decisions of the party leaders and the Federal Cabinet remain unchanged, they are not softened."
"Out of respect for the victims of the tragic train accident, the CSU&#39;s political Ash Wednesday does not take place tomorrow. # CSUAM16"
"All of Bavaria mourns the deaths of the train disaster. Our thoughts are with the victims, the injured and the relatives."
RT @CSU: We mourn the victims of the #BadAibling train crash. Our deepest sympathy goes to families and relatives. https://t.co/p...
At the Bundestag order service everyone - including the SPD head - can order the latest edition of the book &quot;How the German Bundestag works&quot;.
Fix is fixed. We do not allow such a change in procedure to be torn down at all. # Asylpaket2
"After the cabinet decision, the # Asylum Package2 is no longer a matter for two ministers, but a matter for Parliament."
"If you want to gradually abolish the #cash, you restrict the #freedom of the citizens."
"For many citizens, only cash is true! Citizens should be able to choose how they pay. Everything else would be patronizing. #Cash"
You have to ask @spdde what the unnecessary 3 months delay for Asylum Package II has now brought.
We continue to consider the pressure to limit the inflow soon. #Asylum
Persistence pays off! The struggle of the CSU &amp; von Horst #Seehofer for effective results instead of weak compromises has paid off.
Now there can be no compromise on the compromise.
"There was a written agreement on the Asylum Package 2 between the three party leaders on November 5, which was already a compromise."
"It is only one person, Sigmar Gabriel, that will postpone the Asylum Package II since November."
The Austrians do it. So we have to do it too. #Upper limit
RT @Markus_Soeder: # Secretary General is not an easy job ... I know what I&#39;m talking about ;-) @AndiScheuer #CSU https://t.co/DKXJIQCKRG
Future topics at the closed conference of the CSU in #Kreuth. Horst Seehofer is looking ahead. https://t.co/mqDNFcJ9Hq
This can only result in an immediate end to your stay in Germany.
"When asylum seekers or refugees commit such attacks, it is a blatant abuse of the right to stay."
That&#39;s why I call for a much stronger police presence at focal points and comprehensive video surveillance in metropolitan areas.
The rule of law must make every effort to ensure that women are in the public arena without fear of assault. Can move space.
It is intolerable that women in German cities are sexually assaulted and robbed on the street by young #migrants at night.
