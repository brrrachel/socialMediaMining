"We Social Democrats make up a third of the EU commissioners. We want to make Europe more social, democratic and sustainable. This also requires a strong federal government, driven by a strong SPD. @TimmermansEU makes it clear what it is about: https://www.vorwaerts.de/artikel/frans-timmermans-zukunft-eu-spd-hat-entscheidende-rolle…"
The co-founder of #ExtinctionRebellion did not understand the #Holocaust or does not want to understand it: The industrial murder of Jews was the most inhumane crime ever! The memory of it doesn&#39;t paralyze us. It helps us prevent fascism.
We need bridges instead of walls! Hardly anyone knows this better than Berliners. The @InitiativeOG has now sent a piece of the old wall to Donald Trump as a reminder. A great campaign that I would be happy to support. Join: https://thewallagainstwalls.com pic.twitter.com/gnCyVkW1CA
"I didn&#39;t make it easy for myself, but despite all the injuries and differences in content between us, I will vote for @klara_geywitz and @OlafScholz as the new chairman of my party in the second vote. More on that tomorrow in @DerSPIEGEL. #unsereSPD pic.twitter.com/PIkMQ3IyNp"
"Thank you for your work and your friendship, dear Jean-Claude. Europe owes you more than many think. You strengthened the commission and at the same time respected the parliament. That will always remain immortalized in the foundation of our European Union. https://twitter.com/JunckerEU/status/1189557258897776640…"
"If it really comes to a fair #BrexitDeal, it is gratifying given the circumstances. But I also made it clear in the #Bundestag today: Renationalization is the wrong way. We only solve the challenges of our time together. pic.twitter.com/zerXVdyEaT"
"When Erdogan attacks @HeikoMaas personally, it shows that the president is going crazy and has no grip on the diplomatic scene. And: the stop of arms export permits is having an effect. We stand behind Heiko Maas and against the offensive in Northeast Syria!"
It is no longer possible to seriously negotiate with the Turkish President and his methods of joining the EU. The EU accession negotiations with Turkey have to be seen as failed. It is time we finally made this clear to Mr. Erdogan.
"In the short term, economic sanctions will have Erdogan feeling that we are opposing his escalation of violence. In addition, the suspension of all economic cooperation agreements with Turkey, including the customs union, should be seriously examined."
Erdogan&#39;s threat to terminate the refugee agreement with the EU is cynical and should not be used as a reason to tolerate his behavior. It is inhuman to balance people&#39;s suffering with the suffering of others; it is blackmail at the lowest level.
"The arms embargo of some EU countries, including Germany, against Turkey is correct. Unfortunately, the entire EU was unable to bring about a joint embargo yesterday. However, we must continue to do so."
The headstrong decision to withdraw troops from the United States is plunging into chaos. Trump has betrayed his Kurdish allies. Nor can Turkey&#39;s brutal war of aggression against the Kurdish regions in northern Syria be justified.
I congratulate @AbiyAhmedAli on the #Nobel Prize! It is only thanks to his courage that one of the largest democratization projects in Africa can succeed in Ethiopia. I was only able to convince myself of this last week. He deserves our full solidarity and support!
"&quot;The enemy is on the right.&quot; Chancellor Wirth made this clear after the murder of the Jewish Foreign Minister Rathenau. The Nazi poison sloshed through the Weimar Republic, which ultimately destroyed it. The enemy of our second republic also stands and sits on the right. Let&#39;s stop it!"
