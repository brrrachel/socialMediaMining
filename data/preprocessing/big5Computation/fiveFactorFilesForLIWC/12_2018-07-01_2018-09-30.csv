"Dear @gerorgrestle, nobody questions that. But you can also appeal against decisions. Called the rule of law. In the present case it seems rather questionable why the decision was served late. CL"
"Dear @RobertHabeck: You like to take on the role of the non-partisan reminder. Sorry, not acceptable here. Like everyone, you only have the knowledge of a newspaper reader. On the basis of this, one cannot seriously put in the room that it was played with the rule of law. CL"
"Before the chant on the rule of law after the #SamiA case, the facts should first be clear. &quot;Chaos&quot; (quote @roberthabeck) can be complained about later if necessary. Incidentally, an administrative court could also be wrong. CL"
The good idea of #inclusion should not become a green ideology - I said that in the NRW election campaign last year. Now our school minister Yvonne #Gebauer is doing something. CL https://twitter.com/bildungslandnrw/status/1017337968867102720‚Ä¶
"The @JoeKaeser is right when he says that the public should not be left to populist and authoritarian voices. This attitude is exemplary. Conversely, it would be embarrassing that other DAX giants would remain silent out of opportunism. CL"
This is either a joke or paid propaganda to put me in the context. I was recently defamed as a racist for a report from everyday life in a bakery. üòÇ CL
The #GroKo&#39;s decision to officially initiate Gerhard # Schr√∂der&#39;s visit to Ankara is insensitive. Schr√∂der is more representative of Russian interests than German ambassador ... CL
No gloating over the resignation of #Davis: The #Brexit threatens to become a fiasco that also weakens #EU and Germany. Therefore incomprehensible that #GroKo takes so much time with a big request from @fdpbt ... CL
What does the Groko say in the Immigration Act? No content is known and specified. We also have ideas. CL
So really? Perhaps you will get to know that this is an active contribution to nature conservation. No biodiversity without hunting. CL
"There are now &quot;#transit procedures&quot; for five to ten people a day. Plus the still-free catchword #emigration law. Is that supposed to be the ‚Äúturning point‚Äù announced by @CSU? For theater, including threats of resignation? A joke. CL"
"Well done, @MinPres Mark #Rutte. Because #trade wars only know losers. CL #trump #freetrade @welt pic.twitter.com/nDSvRksIcU"
Gladly! TL
Thank you. TL

I find this open letter impressive. It is a warning: criticism of the management of migration must not lead to the rejection of immigration and diversity. One reason why we are calling for an orderly but liberal immigration policy. CL https://twitter.com/bisomratte/status/1038494577928355841‚Ä¶
"# Driving bans are a scandalous failure on the part of #GroKo. First, we need hardware retrofitting. Where people have been cheated on, industry has to bear costs. We also need a fund solution for voluntary hardware retrofitting of Euro 5 #Diesel cars in affected cities. CL"
Mr. Maassen would not be a trustworthy President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and would then no longer be able to hold his office. ‚ÄùCL (3/3)
"of the Bundestag state what information led to his statements. Until then, the SPD and Greens should curb their outrage. If it turns out that there is no factually reliable background. ... (2/3)"
@Faznet brings only a part of my quote to # Maassen on the front page tomorrow - it looks like a request for resignation. We are not that far yet! The facts must first be clear. Here as a service the complete text: &quot;Mr. Maassen should be on the interior committee ... (1/2)
"Today French President @EmmanuelMacron welcomes Mrs. #Merkel - but first he met with our liberal heads of government at @ALDEParty. A strong signal. If @CDU and @CSU pact with #Orban, they weaken the European idea. CL https://twitter.com/DerSPIEGEL/status/1037783247462195200‚Ä¶"
It is the federal government you have supported. It is your President for the Protection of the Constitution. We have voiced enough criticism of him and transparency has been required in recent weeks. If you no longer trust him: ask to be released. CL
You have to take the advice from #Massassen to #Chemnitz seriously. # False information can come from all sides. A president of the @BfV_Bund must now now give further facts and backgrounds in such a sensitive matter. We are waiting for that. CL
