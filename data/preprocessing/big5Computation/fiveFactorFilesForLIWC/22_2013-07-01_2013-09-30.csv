99.3 RADIO Frankfurt: from 14:40 you hear Annalena Baerbock (and me too).
@Wichttsichtig misunderstood. The message was: &quot;# high performers&quot; are not only those that @stefanolix had in mind. #PostFDPZeit
More than 1 &quot;columnist chimera&quot;? ;-) &quot;@Honourstone: More than an alliance: good reasons for black and green http://www.faz.net/-gpg-7hyrx&quot;
@stefanolix I don&#39;t know. Ask @SteffiLemke.
"@stefanolix In addition, the program contained more than just tax policy with regard to the economy. But admittedly: accumulated tax effects too high."
@stefanolix Your &quot;top performer&quot; rhetoric is treacherous. Our #income tax concept would have relieved 90% of the # service providers.
@brocksrock&#39;s inner party dispute usually has 3 phases: meanness-clarity-commonality. Are now approximately between 1 + 2. # Hope
"@stefanolix Indeed, regarding # economic and industrial policy, I would say that the election program was better than it was communicated."
@JoergRupp Golden Words! I&#39;m trying to remember that. ;-)
@JoergRupp We will have to stick together better in the future! ;-)
@paneuma What is that? You can dose poison and bile! Congratulations! :-P
@SteffiLemke Can @sven_giegold play hard against me. I was always in agreement with relevant European (dispute) questions. :-)
@chri_koe You bet on it!
@GerhardLechner I am convinced that Merkel hegemony over the European issue should not have been left. Because more attack could have been used.
@Raghayn Now I&#39;m leaving it again. But why should people get away with any history retouching? You could also leave.
@tibormaxam Yes.
"@Andreas__Nagel By, for example, organizationally slowing down initiatives by your own European experts and politicians."
@Joerg_H Question is justified. But there was a &quot;sound&quot; in the program. (How the overall program was better than the # election campaign.) Remaining paper.
@KLausi_Berlin Our chairman in Stuttgart had about 10 times as many first votes as Rösler in Hanover.

"@JulianMuetsch As for #Claudia, you&#39;re right. Can&#39;t estimate enough people what she has done for greens since she was BuVo!"
@JulianMuetsch Of course I want to influence discourse. About to be criticized? Doesn&#39;t want leadership to be cemented. Otherwise analysis doesn&#39;t matter.
@JoergRupp Then there is nobody left except you and me. ;-)
@JoergRupp @gudruncita That would be wrong because you are right to criticize only JT. But he had a primary responsibility as a top candidate.
@TFKrawczyk Maybe we can get a better balance. It won&#39;t be easy. Because the mistakes were widely carried.
"@JLichdi By the way: the &quot;own lack of #mobilization&quot; is not an explanation, but at best a question of such. #why"
"@JLichdi And if we both had done all of this, shouldn&#39;t we criticize? Also not eg difference between economic program and WK?"

@JensParker To agree here + there out of responsibility was not a problem. But that we accepted Merkel&#39;s hegemony in EU politics: wrong.
@paneuma nothing &quot;behind the scenes&quot;! I formulated my criticism early and over and over again; internally and publicly. Unfortunately in vain.
@machtoption You&#39;re right too.
"Really not fair, as Trittin and Lemke talk away today about the fact that they systematically prevented the #Europe issue in the election campaign."
@stephanfroehder It is not correct that # nothing was said before. # EU policy was banished from the WK against massive internal resistance.
"KGE: &quot;We have to have big ideas again.&quot; Aha. Well, because you too. # KeinePlatitüdeAuslassenIstIrgendwieKeineGrosseIdee"
"KGE has a clear message at the beginning of her speech on the #Bundestag election campaign: It wasn&#39;t me, it was Jürgen. # lr13 # top candidate"
# lr13 Jürgen Trittin insists on being a ruler in relation to the federal election campaign. Then implicitly formulates rejection of red-green.
