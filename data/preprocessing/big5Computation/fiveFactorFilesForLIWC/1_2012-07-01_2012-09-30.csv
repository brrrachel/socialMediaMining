@ZDF I would know one
@ bln42 I agree!
@ZDF on ACTA
"@Tomte_Tummetot You have the costs and the risks, the investor a safe investment."
"@hugeLT Honestly, no, but look at wikipedia right away"
"@Tomte_Tummetot Not EVUs, the networks no longer belong to them. Network operators have guaranteed returns, but have to pay outside capital"
"@Tomte_Tummetot no not the EVUs. The network operators can realize this, but must pay interest on third-party capital"
@BaerbelHoehn have just decided that B90 / Greens completely overslept the idea of the citizen dividend when expanding the network ...
I am pleased that my proposal on citizen dividends in network expansion has sparked an intensive debate. I&#39;m grateful for every good aspect
@Schmidtlepp I&#39;ve also done magic ...
"@BR_skraft Thank you for the offer, but I am already under contract with environmental speakers CDU / CSU in the state parliament. Then unfortunately have to go to the airport. Next time!"
@Politik_Fan_Nbg I would almost bet that you are currently not in Munich but in Nbg! :-)
". @ Markus_Soeder Tonight I&#39;m in Munich, but nobody takes me with me. From tomorrow onwards Berlin. Just drink a measure for me! :-)"
. @ SandersWolf Have already set one in the sand at Dörpen! But farmers are not always enthusiastic. And cost more than twice that
@ Corleone1952 5% would definitely be a good return and whether it is change depends on how much you invest.
@silkherrmann Will provide details on this. But first the idea has to be accepted.
@ Corleone1952 Let&#39;s see how the reaction to the interview is. Then there is a detailed catalog and hopefully the result soon!
@twittycmf @marlenemortler I&#39;ve never had a clientele policy in my life - and I&#39;ve been in the Bundestag for 18 years
"@hugeLT I just did, but wiki says there is no scientific evidence yet."
"@seelenweil Yes, because nobody can know whether lye will penetrate tomorrow, in 5 years or not at all."
@ingwerbaer @BerndSchreiner I&#39;m curious to see what you have to offer!
@ aotto1968_2 First I have to enforce it :-)
@marlenemortler No one has invited me yet :-(!
"@osterlohmichael depends on it. Bad for lines through Germany, therefore loans or vouchers. Rather with local lines"
@BerndSchreiner I will soon be in the Fat Angel for the energy transition!
"@ aotto1968_2 &#39;It is the same, but I think with 85% of the volume they are also well served."
@janjaapvanhalem Thank you very much. And goodbye. Have an appointment for the Jos-van-Gennip lecture
@ TheBug0815 If you have Glenmorangie too! :-)
"@geka_FF @ TheBug0815 Rather rare, but when I do I like the #Glenmorangie"
"@ tindrum46 The electricity customers are involved in the levy, true. Therefore, at least part of it should benefit citizens again"
"Go to the Oktoberfest of the CDU Rehlingen, read you later!"
"@ Storm calm No, because the network companies are allowed to make over 9% return. They should give something of that."
"@Nytcon No, because the networks do not belong to the power companies. If citizens invest (and earn), this is at the expense of large investors"
@CCarlitta Congratulations and good luck in the new media!
@BerndSchreiner But hello! The energy transition will be a successful project.
"@florianbamberg With a minimum stake of 500 euros, however, a large number could participate who have no houses."
"@GabyBereitstell Reverse, exactly the opposite! :-)"
"@genenano solar energy is already installed with 30,000 MW, in a few years it will be 52,000 MW. THIS is enormous added value."
@svenseele yes and that&#39;s exactly what I want to extend to the networks
"@H_Luebbers Clear, but from 500 € at 5% interest. Quite a few can afford that, and many retirees and students"
The energy transition also means adding value and as many as possible should be involved.
Tomorrow in the FAS I propose that citizens have the opportunity to benefit financially from the expansion of the electricity grids.
@silkherrmann @pv_forum Large substations hang on the cables at the front and back. This is particularly difficult on the high seas.
@MrLamse Many already know and new ones are added every day!
"@pv_forum Yes, that&#39;s right, but how do you want to change that? The difference in costs will be higher the lower the electricity price."
@burkarddregger Find great that you are now on Twitter! Good luck with your work!
@pv_forum I am very much in favor of this: with a sense of proportion and tailored to the networks. Then it remains affordable.
Again and again when you meet followers like @tokoo during the many appointments! Good shot! :-))
@rolandtheis @kritikkultur - so much prominence on the streets of Berlin. Can you already see that I&#39;m your follower!
@SteffiLemke heard better Kalauer! Correct: our mandate only lasts until the next election! #Demokratietweet
"@JochenFlasbarth many thanks for the good reception, I was very happy. Good debate, great motivation"
I just just drove past @kritikkultur: happy evening!
@JochenFlasbarth @Umweltbundesamt Hopefully I won&#39;t break a sweat! I&#39;m very excited and have a lot of questions!
@silkherrmann @seelenweil that is one of the topics that are very controversial
"@genenano So there I&#39;ve been, recently in Gelsenkirchen on the subject of saving energy, but anytime and gladly again!"
@seelenweil you just don&#39;t know. That is why we want to promote recovery and security together
@slowfoodberlin Has rarely been featured so extensively! Thanks and have a nice evening!
"@JoschaJ Well, tonight I ate frying with potato salad with Renate Künast! :-)"
Tomorrow I will visit the @umweltbundesamt. I look forward to exciting debates!

@hansjuergenkrug @petertauber @BaerbelHoehn &#39;A really excellent article that I just enjoyed reading!
"@petertauber Frankly, without your comment at the JU in Bad Marienberg I would have missed it! ..."
@scampy_joe What are these things?
@janboehm This is due to the medium. The minister is also being petted and he will put up with that.
"@TMampel Nix against Facebook, but Twitter is super direct. In addition, followers are called &quot;friends&quot;, because you can quickly get to the wrong one."
"If I didn&#39;t have the @KonstantinNotz, I wouldn&#39;t know that the crime scene still exists. Can you really set the clock! :-)"

"Incidentally, I owe my entry to Twitter to @petertauber (who else) and @BaerbelHoehn (because she scolded pirates at Anne Will)!"
@ dazi01 Congratulations on the award to the Saar in Saarlouis! All the best!

@music_composer not at all
"@pv_forum clear, but this is only possible for the future and not for projects that are already under construction"

"@ Wolfram Wagner I just changed that and answered you too. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. I rarely make propaganda."

"@seewolfDE The decision was made months ago by competent bodies for certain funds, according to law. Without me."
@Cyrus_McDugan :-)

". @ DieterTillmann In meetings I reached about 100 people, some could ask. With Twitter I can do 23 T and everyone can answer"
", @ericalaeta If you look at it as PR, you&#39;re missing out on the best: expanding your horizons. Propaganda goes everywhere, communication on Twitter."
. @ xsteadfastx It seems longer because it is insanely intense through the inter-actions. A lot has also happened in politics.
". @ Gaming_Dude The most interest is in network topics. But also a lot of human, more than you think!"

@dw_globalideas Thank you for the great presentation. I learned a lot. Greetings to the little coral - hopefully the monsters won&#39;t find them!
"@Tomte_Tummetot With renewables, of course, but the expansion is currently much faster than the networks ..."
"@OrtsPIRAT That should come too, and ide wind power will be further expanded. But not all at once and immediately. Otherwise nothing works."
". @ travelhms You were a great audience! I would love to save all glaciers, but that will probably only be possible with a global energy transition!"
"@pc_org Yes, too bad, that was unfortunately force majeure. But I can offer someone as a replacement who is fully in the stuff u can speak for me"
"@erik_fluegge @danielmack Klaro, but the beginning is long over, because renewable energies already have 25% electricity"
@danielmack would still need coal / gas because the sun does not shine at night and there is often a lull
"@danielmack at the pace, the electricity demand will be covered by wind in a few years. Does funding continue or does it end abruptly?"
@yewa Yesterday it was exactly one year. And I know many who don&#39;t know what it is!
"@Geisterfalle On the other hand, anonymity also gives freedom, for example towards superiors. Really difficult."
"@Geisterfalle There you can discuss. Letters to the editor are also not anonymous and visdP is needed for leaflets, although this prevents many."
@MandyEbisch Exactly like that! :-))
@carumcarvi We&#39;ll see. The advantage of Twitter is its directness. But a few more characters would not be bad.
@ fronk23 Whoever has it doesn&#39;t want to miss it. Those who don&#39;t have it don&#39;t know it.
"@tomaschek New game, new luck! I&#39;m looking forward to it. :-)"
"@Denkepalau Yes, of course, because most of them have no idea what it is. Felt the same way!"
"@scampy_joe So far, it has only been indispensable for those who know it. In contrast to the cell phone, you don&#39;t see Twitter. Therefore it takes longer"
"@markusdahlem In any case, all colleagues in the Bundestag!"
@Fatze_Buck :-))
"@smrqdt Not that I know of! 90% of the students are on Facebook, hardly any on Twitter."
"20 years ago, some people rejected the cell phone because constant accessibility was terrible. Today they don&#39;t want to miss it anymore."
"In a few years, Twitter will be as natural as the cell phone today. Not always loved, but essential! :-)"
@mamaseinsohn How do you get it? Think there&#39;s more tweeted about him.
"@MarvinDrees Yes, of course, I&#39;m looking forward to it!"
"@bund_net No, but it would also not be a good idea to pay a lot of electricity that cannot be used due to the lack of cables"
@sven_kindler in the 10-point program is the clearest commitment to the energy transition that a responsible minister has ever made!
@FlorianSchmiedl The JU-Westerwald &amp; Co is one of the best that the JU has to offer on Twitter!
@ redaction42 :-)
. @ JTrittin Definitely: Take out aces trash. Therefore we do the Lex-Aces (with all factions) to write the return in the law!
@Duesenberg_ :-)
With Twitter I reached people I would never have met otherwise. This is a huge win and fun too! Read you!
"Leaflet, press, radio, and television are one-way streets - Twitter is oncoming traffic! More dangerous, but extremely exciting!"
Today I&#39;ve been on Twitter for 1 year. Since then I have communicated directly with more people than in 20 years before. Thanks to everyone for following!
"Congratulations to Leopold Borm, the new federal president of the Schüler Union"
@michalietz And whether. But I&#39;m still busy with the energy transition for a while. Not bad if people have respect by then.
"@LittleDevilcom @Politik_Fan_Nbg It&#39;s not a job, it&#39;s a matter of course! :-)"
@Politik_Fan_Nbg What else! :-))
@ MarcosD1993 thank you!
@Politik_Fan_Nbg I hoped my followers would take care of me! :-)
@ MarcosD1993 I don&#39;t know. Actually thought that I was pure friendliness during the debate! :-)
I am glad that since the #TodayShow I have got so many offers as a bodyguard. In this respect I&#39;m unfortunately already committed and absolutely loyal!
@SU_Saar Nice greeting back from Trier + have fun in Berlin!
Would like to be at # pc12 now. Then at least I would know who I am :-). And where my friends are. #Triertweet
@ hammerhead2206 @guidobrinkel This has to do with the fact that I&#39;m tweeting myself and that I&#39;m dealing with the energy transition.
@ DennisP78 Mr. Sailer has been saying this for a long time. Others say different and I just want us to try everything we can to make it possible
@ larsik78 is not like you? :-))
@Volker_Beck @elbindjana @jtretin On every ship that steams and sails ... full energy ahead!
@Volker_Beck @elbindjana @jtretin Whatever he meant: I&#39;m very happy that the green ones can&#39;t get past me!

@BerndSchreiner Exactly. And thanks again for the homemade honey. I was very happy about it!

. @ sven_kindler blasphemes in the Bundestag about my Twitter activities. Guess he&#39;s kind of jealous! :-)
. @ danielmack Do you actually think that annual growth rates of over 10% are sustainable in any area?
@DWoehrl @christiansoeder yes what else? :-)
@flo_wi Good idea. But the @Schmidtlepp has to go too.
"@christiansoeder Suggest, we do a joint PK and uncover the swindle! :-)"
"@christiansoeder No, vice versa, the SPD doesn&#39;t get it: The pirates invented @peteraltmaier to prevent red-green! Logo!"

@FDP_NF @RuedigerKohls Best regards back to the FDP and all the best to North Frisia!
"@DKummetz you don&#39;t have to. But when wind onshore growth rates exceed 10%, the bad awakening gets worse. #Sustainability"
@DKummetz I got a lot of applause from #Husumwind. Because open &amp; honest
@hjrueb You are right that we have to do more for energy efficiency. That is where the greatest innovation potential lies!
@ added-value energy It is just that we are breaking the 50% mark at the current rate of expansion in 2020. But that would be too fast for networks and storage
@Torgator I hope so very much! If I can&#39;t come to Kiel for pirate coffee!
@Oldperl not my statements were the problem but their interpretation :-)
@daniel_eck after all you are already on Twitter: congratulations and see you on Wednesday
@Typowerk @cdubiblis Great. Come back to it again
@MarotoMauricio the tweets are not enough. Get my testimony from the greentech press conference :-)
@CDUBiblis Missed you at the future congress of the CDU Hessen! You are always so good on the net and wanted to get to know each other!
@MarotoMauricio :-))

@scampy_joe :-))
"@likedeel I would be very happy, but I am already looking to go to Erfurt for the German nature conservation day at 12:00. Definitely next time!"
"@MarotoMauricio not only with and also abroad, eg Saudi Arabia"
@MarotoMauricio you probably mean the new greentech atlas. Crazy important for many who want to invest in UT.
I&#39;m really looking forward to the wind energy tomorrow in Husum. Great opportunity to refute the nonsensical allegations.
"@ebner_sha If the expansion goes much faster, the grids don&#39;t come along and we pay for electricity that is not used at all"
"@ebner_sha I want us to have 52,000 megawatts of installed wind power by 2050 as planned."
"@HBraun As a member of the government, I am of course obliged to be truthful in everything! :-)"

"@UlrichKelber I am convinced that saving energy, electricity and fuel is becoming increasingly popular. Not by compulsion, but by insight!"
"@triplesmart interesting that you come up with this suggestion! The idea sounds great, but is unfortunately still unaffordable at the moment."
"@vincentkiefer Well, as Minister you have the best thoughts! :-)"
The fact that fuel prices are at record levels shows that we have to reduce our dependence on oil. Not just because of climate protection.
@Westfalenpower I can not judge because I do not know the facts. Is the project concrete?

"@danielmack It&#39;s about sustainability: Unfortunately also about &quot;sustainability competition&quot;: More coal for education, energy or debt reduction?"
@genenano They would like that! :-) But only then comes the energy turnaround (including networks!)
"@mariobeyer After Fukushima, action had to be taken quickly. Was okay in parliament, but public debate was neglected"
"@danielmack Unfortunately, many are only interested in &quot;coal&quot;. But that&#39;s exactly what I want to change :-)"
"The fact that we are now having a debate is positive. In the future, every step (funding, networks, etc.) must first be discussed in public."
But it can only succeed if the individual interests are combined to form a whole. It is a learning process that started far too late.
"The main problem with the energy transition is that everyone only sees it from the point of view of their interest. No matter whether wind, sun, coal, gas."
@dcfurth wrote a great post that shows that politics and politics matter as much. Congratulation!
Impressed by @BiancaJagger 's fight against climate change in favour of The plant a pledge initiative. Need more of it!

"@danielmack Not slow, but as planned. Otherwise, the costs spread over 40 J accrue in one fell swoop."
"@danielmack I&#39;m not attacking anything or anyone, I&#39;m advertising that the expansion of renewable energy will be spread over 40 years by 2050 as planned"
@JrgTimm It depends on the mix: The sun never shines at night and not always during the day. Offshore wind blows about 4500 hours a year.

"@manfredtopp No, not necessarily. In Berlin there are a lot of them from Poland who are making a living at home."
@DoroBaer @Degenar I always thought that emancipated women had no washing machines at all ...
@markushoff He even got the Tonton price and toasted it half the night!
@Dutschino @iInselkoenig Congratulations! If I don&#39;t have a pol. I would be really scared of opponents more: &#39;About democracy!
@janetworkx This is so true! Looking forward to it like Bolle
@MDR_SAN for you always! :-)
@Honourstone @dlf The colleague Vaatz is known for my original comments and appreciated by me. But here he is so wrong ...
"@DerProVomKlo To both, you smarties! if the electricity becomes too expensive, we lose jobs and have no more money for the environment"
"@Doener Vice versa: I did a lot for gays, women, foreigners in the CDU because I was not interested in convincing my own interests"
@Doener politicians have to live with speculation and should not give their mustard to everything. :-)
@OnkelAndi A project the size of the energy transition can only succeed if it is supported by the sensible forces of the economy!
@MKreutzfeldt soon more must eat for the climate!
@MKreutzfeldt had happened before I came :-(
"@MKreutzfeldt the PV compromise wasn&#39;t that bad. And in the case of offshore liability and energy efficiency rl, bmu also came off well"
@MKreutzfeldt I have never shied away from conflicts. But you can expect unity from the government! Is not at the expense of the environment
"@Til_Heuser that&#39;s how it is! If the energy transition is to succeed, we need to know where to go"
"@texjoachim No, that&#39;s why I invented the expression Coalition of The Committed! :-)"
@GruenChristian Read your tweet now and I&#39;m confused. Didn&#39;t we fight that nobody should be forced into a role picture?
"@waldrebe On the contrary: I want the energy transition to succeed. This is brave, but it requires a sense of reality."
"@ Chris_Ben9 Another whole number of years, just because of citizen participation."
@GruenChristian Why should that be necessary? CCS is probably not built in the Altmark and otherwise I didn&#39;t do anything bad.
"@Oliver_Krischer of course he works on it all the time, but it doesn&#39;t depend on the big bell"
@Oliver_Krischer I can politely remind you that D agreed to the RL in the Council - to the surprise of many. Why did it matter?
@jacobspanke :-))
"@worldly known home story is something else. By the way, I&#39;ve had political interviews since taking office in Spiegel, Focus, Wi-Woche, WamS ... :-)"
"@Bayaman you have ideas! :-) Of course I gladly accepted that. By the way, I really enjoy it!"
"@wirsindvdi So I did it with everything: If it is not fun, you are not really good!"
. @ Duesenberg_ Mutually. But with the survey numbers #Pirates have to come up with something. Otherwise I have to take over the shop! :-)
". @ greenIMMO Unfortunately, as a BMU, I often cannot answer all of the questions because there is not enough time. But I always read the questions"
"@Felicea @cducsubt Well, now you have revealed the secret! :-) That is not always a good thing."
@ Steel raven And whether! Not everyone has that many! :-)
. @ ClaravonHeidi @TobiasDeters Oh what. A little irony. But I really would not have thought what would become of my first tweet :-))
@DieterTillmann That is very good and should be the case with everyone! But I&#39;m only around 50 days in office ...
"@ victor5679 @petertauber No breathing! Anyway, he didn&#39;t hold me back! :-)"
"@robdelubo @jacobspanke Yes, as foreign minister he was constantly looking after (the) world!"
@tt_raser Greetings back! I was still there this afternoon!
". @ TobiasDeters I hug everyone! It&#39;s a shame that I no longer know who my 1st follower was - with him, calamity took its course!"
"I welcome @jacobspanke as my 20,000th follower! As a BMU, I am particularly pleased that it is someone who cares about the environment!"
"@SimoneSteinig @RKiesewetter I should avoid that. Otherwise, compensation areas must be created elsewhere."
Great Bundestag nomination for my friend @RKiesewetter and spirit of optimism with over 200 guests. We create the energy transition!
@Schmidtlepp you have your TL but something like this in view! :-)
@air_dal @zdf You can find out who I am following. I try to answer tweets from non-celebrities
"@zweibohnen Well, we need registration laws. But it always depends on the detail. :-)"
@einfranz I really hope so. Because there is really something going on with the energy transition and environmental protection!
@markushoff I would find that super nice. Only fear that they have another Altmeier in their sights :-)
"Over the course of the day, the news situation on the subject of the Registration Act has relaxed considerably. That&#39;s how it is with the network."
@markushoff Unfortunately they made a typo: They write &quot;Altmeier&quot; with &quot;ei&quot;. :-)
@tomaschek where did you get that from? :-)
@Cuba_Libre_Jr You really gave me a good idea! :-)
The ACTA example shows what happens when you design the realities of the network! Rarely has a project crashed like this!
"Thanks for the Twitterview, was fun, now I&#39;m hungry! Thanks also to the staff who organized everything!"
@haastrecht Actually only good ones. We just have to get on with it. #fragBMU
@FabianAjaj Brazil is already very far and they start in China: central argument: own interest! #fragBMU
@haastrecht Looks like we&#39;re not going to go as quickly as planned. So you have to ask what goes wrong!
"@haastrecht Nobody can say that exactly. Repository is certainly a very big challenge, with nuclear power plants it&#39;s faster. #fragBMU"
@FWhamburg @RegSpeaker Noise is often a local problem that only interests those affected. But I will take initiatives
@haastrecht @regrecher So 70% answered!
@JottEs @gipsler Bravo! Should make more people!
"@glojz Now it&#39;s about energetic building renovation. Otherwise, we will soon publish a report with options #fragBMU"
@ Ivory Prince This is in the EU Treaty (Lisbon Treaty).
@stober_stephan @regrecher We choose that! :-) But try to address everyone if possible
@ D3rB3obacht3r BMU and BMWi have agreed on liability regulation. That will make the thing afloat again. Teething #fragBMU
"@ Government4tel @iInselkoenig Yes, all are voters, but not all are my voters!"
"@ BobComali1 Oh dear, you ask questions! I talked about this at the Petersberg Dialog, among other things, there was a lot in the press"
"@lieselm However, renewable energies also stimulate the economy quite a bit. There are tens of thousands working now!"
"@seewolfDE Yes, but that is not in question."
@Degenar :-))
@musik_biologie At least not as long as I&#39;m Federal Minister for the Environment. But that depends mainly on the voters.
. @ iInselkoenig Followers are not necessarily voters. They are often political opponents. But you can communicate with them via Twitter.
"@ZDF I would know, but the reverse would regret many followers!"
"@rheto I just answered @karstenlucke. Has been explained 1000 times, but is not believed. :-("
. @ b0ns4i Incorrect accent: the energy transition has really come into focus due to the change of minister.
". @ Degenar Indeed I am, provided, of course, they didn&#39;t connect the old fridge in the basement :-)"
@karstenlucke Such claims have been spreading since the introduction of the euro. The denial is of no use because the opponents are ideologues.
@JonasScheunig This is not the first time and is due to the fact that - unlike on Twitter - I cannot personally check all emails
@fehr_deal through more efficiency and more renewables
@JoergRupp This is clear from the higher efficiency: Much less CO2 per kwh
"@ bln42 @danielmack We will completely replace the nuclear power plants with renewables. Back up with gas, especially new coal-fired power plants to replace old ones."
. @ danielmack I didn&#39;t say that either! :-) But: replace old environmentally harmful coal-fired power plants with new ones. Eg Moorburg
@sayez at least! :-)
"Good visit to BaWü at MP Kretschmann u Min Untersteller. Here in BaWü, the energy transition is implemented in many places!"
@ sidv69lpz bingo! I am just being driven across the Republic and every time I turn left I accidentally get the send button!
@ZDF &quot;who steals books is criminal but you don&#39;t take your reading glasses away
@ZDF Definitely @sigmargabriel and @Schmidtlepp
@scanlines subsidies almost always create false incentives and lead to waste - regardless of whether the recipient is poor or rich
@ZDF The fact that you often do not know who you really tweet with could be a problem. Otherwise I can&#39;t see any negative sides.
@ZDF
@ZDF That you often don&#39;t know
"@ZDF I basically tweet when I have time. In addition, I find it difficult to get to bed in the evening!"
"@tsghessen Sorry, I just saw you. Am your follower now so that"
"@Uli_Beck sure, I promised a 10-point program"
Etzel is forward-looking! I congratulate you on early public participation in caverns! Changes can only succeed with people!
@mcjoas The EU obliges us to separate operators and supervisors. That also makes sense.
@norberthense Schäuble has ensured that the BMF has been on twitter for about 10 months! Congratulations on your candidacy!
@NdsLandesReg Thank you for the friendly welcome! Nds is super dynamic and key country for energy transition!
@ Kyra2001 :-))
"@de_mako This is often the case, because nobody can read and understand all the laws. Hence the committees and public debate"
"@ Kyra2001 I always knew! If you still like me now, I’ll drop by, on an environmental issue, of course!"
". @ Mittsommar I never do that :-). If you read my 1st tweet on the topic, you will find that I especially praised Netz-Power."
"@ aotto1968_2 you never know that in politics, but I&#39;m more of an optimist at home :-)"
. @ thorstendier I find it respectable that politicians sometimes rethink their position in response to public protest. No shame.
@ bln42 @RegSprecher We definitely don&#39;t want equality. #fragBMU
@ Ivory Prince That cannot be decided by the EU because it is a national matter. But I am sure that our example will set the stage.
"@Gipsler Saving electricity can help citizens offset rising prices. This is only sexy to a limited extent, but relieves the wallet! #fragBMU"
"@holgermai @RegSprecher 3) is not new, but important! So that the orientation is not lost. #fragBMU"
@FKTVTwipsy @RegSprecher We are on schedule and I hope that the draft for the Lex aces can be adopted by the cabinet in October
@FWhamburg @RegSprecher Central and decentralized elements belong together. One thing alone is not enough. #fragBMU
@randow @RegSprecher @kokokoch The new government has just been in office for a few weeks. I will meet my French colleague #fragBMU soon
"@holgermai @RegSprecher 1.The prices must remain manageable, 2. I want national consensus on the procedure 3. It remains with conversion goals"
"@holgermai @RegSprecher My work is based on N.Röttgen, but needs to be developed further, especially when it comes to the coordination of the actors. 1.2"
"@BiomassMuse In principle this is correct, but we have to pay attention to the effects on the oil system. # fragBMU"
@DerSchoeneJan @RegSprecher That depends on the point of view: It should already be affordable for ordinary people.
@johanneggert The @RegSpeaker is of course unbeatable. I would never say anything else!
"@MichaelBuzzi I want the energy turnaround to come in southern Europe too, but I&#39;m against new funding."
@NicolasAllie I&#39;m going to organize this. Give me a couple more weeks. :-) #fragBMU
"@stober_stephan @greenpeace_de We are fighting for an ambitious European climate target, the EU will soon make a report on emissions trading with options"
@ D3rB3obacht3r We are doing a boarding school climate initiative and are leading. Many countries are starting to rethink. #fragBMU
"@dirkvl Yes, I know. But the British lobbies in Bxl are the best, and so are the officials."
"@new__energies Like other renewable energies, the wind turbines have the feed-in priority and are paid for the entire electricity feed-in."
"@_hypower To be honest, I don&#39;t really know anything about it. #fragBMU"
@GerKoopmans @regsprecher Geel thank you very much! The debate is quite fun and educational! Greten PEter
@Exilbremer So that tens of thousands of jobs in Germany are not lost. #fragBMU
@NicolasAllie Very simple: When was the last time you used electricity? :-) #fragBMU
@glojz We are concerned with maintaining jobs. The fractions were pretty much in agreement. #fragBMU
@ Faffling94 Where it makes sense ok (nature conservation and residential areas) But in general it would not be payable.
"@ nein6 @RegSprecher I personally was always in favor of it, but that&#39;s not really realistic at the moment :-)"
@kl_motte Electricity prices for private individuals have increased by 3% since 2011. Not as much as generally thought. But we&#39;ll take care of #fragBMU
@srbanister Not quite right: THIS only has to be displayed but not approved!
"@hoechstspannend Certainly not yet, but interest is currently growing enormously. BMU will continue to provide information."
"@haastrecht @ PilotChris_1 Yes, we are working on it"
@stefandt These are not large power plants but the wind turbines from the north (onshore and offshore). The electricity is needed in the south.
"@MichaelBuzzi I do every day. We have the Renewable Energy Platform, as well as a regular association meeting."
@ D3rB3obacht3r @RegSprecher Everyone has the right to the bare minimum. Of course electricity is taken into account. #fragBMU
@ D3rB3obacht3r @RegSprecher Unfortunately not yet. The fridge is mostly empty since I&#39;ve been a minister.
"@schuster_martin So it is now: the lower the stock exchange price, the higher the differential costs according to the EEG!"
@baranek @regrecher We are in the process of defining standards for smart grids and smart meters together with the BMWi
"@Schmidtlepp @RegSprecher The Convention is apparently your concern. If someone comes, I will address this in the name of my pirate friends!"
"@ FrankyB122 @RegSprecher That was missed at the time, but I made up for it: PV subsidy expires when 52 GW is reached"
"@srbanister where is the problem, normally you don&#39;t need a building permit. Feed-in tariffs regulate EEG"
Hi the @RegSprecher and I look forward to a good twiierview. Make yourself ready for something! :-)
@stanglfr :-))
"In Bavaria, the energy transition is at the top of the agenda and there is a lot of commitment at the bottom!"
It says in Bavaria
"Good talks in Bavaria on the energy transition with MP Seehofer, Group leader Schmid and Environment Minister Huber"
Good talks in bavaria
@manuelbewarder Dunkel ist der Rede Sinn: Would You please explain a little bit more in detail what and why?
@DRadioLauscher the photo is so successful! Only the Environment Minister is actually bothering! :-)
@Alex_Neubacher I&#39;m curious if you can also participate in the Twitterview and ask exciting questions about PV!
apropos: the Twitterview on ENERGIEWENDE with @RegSprecher and @peteraltmaier has the hashtag #fragBMU
Tomorrow 6.30pm Twitterview on the topic of energy transition with @RegSprecher and with me (@peteraltmaier). I look forward to exciting questions / dialogues!
"@firefraenks Yes, that is the expansion target for PV by 2020. After that, they have to be competitive: without subsidies!"
"@ JoeRich001 Of course, I really want nothing but uncritical cheers and approval! :-)"
@vertigonix @norberthense That depends. What is a state? You probably meant &quot;nation&quot;
.@dirkvl They hate us and they love us. That´s much butter as any kind of nonchalence!
"@norberthense I am European out of conviction and passion. It doesn&#39;t matter if it ever becomes a state, but it is our future!"
". @ aotto1968_2 @BILD Well, we are politicians. I don&#39;t always agree with @BILD, but I&#39;m happy that BILD has a meion!"
European Integration without GB would perhaps be faster and stronger but certainely less pleasant! For my UK-Friends as well! :-)
"@Fran_Muc Yes, I think so too. Was probably meant nicely by the picture people."
"@Fran_Muc @BILD Oh, that&#39;s still possible. Thought they had something wrong with my politics!"
@Fran_Muc @BILD what did I get it for?
@ Government4tel Because it has a role similar to that of the IMF
"Article 32 ESM is easy: Are the usual rules for international organizations, so proper. Work is possible."
"Sorry for the retweet about the Mopo: hadn&#39;t seen that you had to pay there! Is article about tweeting politicians, he thought is free."
"@MarkusLiebs @RegSprecher @PiratenDiepholz We have commissioned an expert opinion for fracking for the end of July. Anyway, I&#39;m very careful"
"@ PilotChris_1 There are already variable tariffs, but they will be further improved! #fragBMU"
"@Schmidtlepp @RegSprecher If the pirates continue to do so with their internal debates, I will look really black! ;-) #fragBMU"
"@Esowatchcom They are known. But by 2020 we want 35% renewable energy, which means 65% will remain conventional!"
"@johannesvogel  Hello to my beloved coalition-partner! If we stand and fight together, nobody else will succeed"
@agoptron I&#39;m guaranteed not to leave them alone. That&#39;s why I made the compromise.
"@CorneliaDaniel @spiegel_top Yes, it looks like they are not interested in exchanging arguments."
@agoptron The Chinese know very well why they attach such great importance to PV. It will be a topic of the century
@opilef For photovoltaics
@dirkvl @Thomas1G The truth is: You c'ant eat the chicken and have the Eggs!
"we have to do everything in D to make PV competitive. Therefore, from 52 GB, funding is over. Until then, the following applies: soft landing!"
Tomorrow @SPIEGEL_Top criticizes me for the compromise on solar funding. I am deeply convinced that PV is a worldwide hit and 1/2
"@ Thomas1G Yes, I agree. But in practice it is very difficult."
@Joerg_Werner Go to the cottages! A people of gardeners! Think about whether I as a BMU should say something about landscape gardening in Germany
@christiansoeder @karstenlucke I met Nick Clegg in Rio. Good European. Good to have him in government!
@Joerg_Werner Aren&#39;t you the gardener? I&#39;ve missed you already! The most beautiful gardens are in the UK!
"@Denkepalau @ aotto1968_2 @BILD Sometimes yes. But they are often very helpful, for example when it comes to Israel or Turkey."
@christiansoeder @karstenlucke They may leave whenever they want to. But at the end of the day it would be regrettable for everyone!
@norberthense That is your right. But the EU is already doing a lot of what a state is doing. What is missing is democratic legitimation
@alexplus_de @BILD But you are not particularly differentiated! :-)
@ krizzy4peace Thank you! and beautiful end!
@seelenweil You can&#39;t say that. We spend a lot of money for as much security as possible. And for retrieval.
@RoHeinrich :-)
"@Oliver_Krischer @DaKrys The proposal is exciting! Doesn&#39;t have to be an RT meadow, but there would be enough places nearby."
"Incidentally, @peteraltmaier @RoHeinrich @RegSprecher growth should continue, but in the order of 2500 - 3500 MW, still a world record."
"@RoHeinrich @RegSprecher Unfortunately not, because if the sun is shining correctly, solar is already producing as much electricity as 25 nuclear power plants of 1000 MW"
"@ Kotzfrosch I have to have a look. For example, not to what extent this happens."
@Kotzfrosch What should I change exactly?
"@ seho_86 more than you think. Guess 1/3 is on Twitter, but usage is very different"
@leopold_born Congratulations on Twitter and all the best in the new office!
@netzunartig Tomorrow I am invited to the FDP in the AG Environment. I&#39;m looking forward to it
"@Maritierchen What, so many already? I did something!"
@_phoeni But some things can also be regulated from home. Bosses have to respect their employees. Only then will they be good in the long run.
@RaKahleyss @Malpertaus :-))
"@HoppeBernd @sacralo Yes, it was good, and at 74 he still spoke on the roller phonograph."
