"Waking up with or without right-wing populists in parliament? It is up to you if you live in Saarland. Make our country fairer, choose SPD!"
"I am proud that you are fighting for Anke Rehlinger and a fairer country in Saarland, dear comrades. Give everything again!"
"Number 1 in the NRW state list for the Bundestag election. The goal: state government, prime minister, federal government and chancellor - SPD."
The 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome was the beginning of European cooperation. Let us have the courage to fight for this community!
"Fight in Saarland right now with the comrades for the election victory on Sunday, Anke Rehlinger and more justice. Here we start!"
"Art and culture can make us wonder, doubt or think. Was intensely felt again at the book fair in Leipzig."
"&quot;Freedom and life can be taken away from us, honor not.&quot; 84 years ago today Otto Wels delivered his great speech against the Nazi dictatorship."
"Whatever the circumstances, I’m shocked by the terrible news coming from London. My thoughts are with the victims and their families."
"Whatever the background, I am shocked by the attack in London. My thoughts are with the victims &amp; their relatives."
Frank-Walter Steinmeier sworn in as Federal President. And what a speech to kick off! Thank you!
"Men who love men went to prison in our country. To date, no one has compensated her. Thank you for changing that, Heiko Maas!"
"We celebrated 150 years of the SPD Mannheim today. There were over 1000 people, many of them very young. Where else can you find that? That makes me proud."
"For me, the 100% stand for the will to win and the unity of our party: We want more justice. I thank you all!"
"This is a sad day for the EU & especially for the UK. However, I take heart from thousands of young people raising their voice for Europe."
Brexit is bitter for the EU and especially for the UK. But thousands of young people who are taking to the streets for Europe are encouraging.
100 %
"As a man, you can&#39;t insult me worse than being preferred to a woman because of my gender. We have a lot to do!"
What would I do first as Chancellor? Clear commitment to strengthening the EU and fair wages for women.
This is a less good day for the SPD. Less good days are motivation days. The goal remains: change of government in the republic.
"I&#39;m at the party conference now, let&#39;s get started. A little excited but above all determined: it is time for more justice"
"Congratulations to the Prime Minister &amp; many thanks to Anke Rehlinger and the comrades. A strong chase, we keep fighting!"
"Luise Nordhold is 100 years old today. She has been in the SPD for almost 90 years. What a life. Thank you and all the best to you, dear Luise!"
"I think with humility of Otto Wels, Willy Brandt and Sigmar Gabriel. Tomorrow I want to continue writing the history of the SPD with you."
Our daughters get an average 21% less salary than our sons. We need fair wages! It is a question of respect.
"Freedom was your big issue. Thank you for these five years, Joachim Gauck! And enjoy your new freedom!"
Everyone must be able to rely on unemployment insurance. That is why I want to expand the insurance coverage of ALG I.
"Wilders was unable to win the election in NL. I am relieved, but we must continue to fight for an open and free Europe."
"I am glad that there are brave people who also fight for democracy against resistance in Turkey. Thank you, Can Dündar!"
Geert Wilders could not win the NL election. I&#39;m relieved. But we must continue to fight for an open and free Europe!
Progress must finally mean progress for everyone. That&#39;s why I&#39;m fighting for better qualifications and unemployment benefits Q.
Women are not a minority. That will also apply to the SPD ministers in my cabinet.
"If single parents still have to spend part of their wages on daycare fees, something is wrong. Therefore: Free of charge in education!"
Anyone who becomes unemployed needs a new chance - regardless of their age. Qualification is the best remedy for long unemployment.
Against the shortage of skilled workers and for new opportunities for everyone who becomes unemployed: legal right to further training and unemployment benefit Q.
"Horst Ehmke was witty and passionate. Together with Willy Brandt, he gave Germany so much. He will be very missing."
In the Aachen employment agency I exchanged views with job seekers. One conclusion: we need better qualification offers.
"In Berlin, some crazy people are programming the hackathon for my election campaign for 24 hours. Skyped with them. Thank you and a lot of energy!"

"10,000 new members. :)"
Enthusiasm for our community is a prerequisite for more justice in the country. Thank you for giving everyone so much gas!
Mr. Erdogan has to release Deniz Yücel - just like all the other journalists arrested with flimsy reasons.
Germany is not just Berlin. We also live here in medium-sized cities and in many small villages. You have to be able to live well everywhere!
"Today I&#39;m talking in Leipzig. I&#39;m fighting for a Germany with the same opportunities. Whether east or west, whether city or country, whether man or woman."
Met a geriatric nurse today who wants to improve care with a startup. Great! But we also have to do it politically!
The focus of my political efforts will always be that everyone in Germany gets work and can live on it with dignity.
Friendship instead of foreclosure! This is especially true for Germany and France. Nice to speak to Prime Minister @BCazeneuve today.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier has already shown today that he will find the right words. As the non-partisan president of all Germans.
"The third social democratic president has been elected! Congratulations, Frank, you will do it really well. # bpw17"
I read on the Internet: &quot;More and more parents are recommending their children not to graduate from high school.&quot; That&#39;s not how it is meant!
"I just discussed online with over 700 new members. Including an engineer, a conductor and many young people. Take a lot with you!"

"&quot;I am fine personally, but something is wrong in the country,&quot; a lot of people tell me at the moment. I want to find answers to that."
We cannot leave those who care for our closest relatives and also us alone! That is what respect demands.
"Limiting excesses in manager salaries has nothing to do with envy, but has a lot to do with respect and justice."
No wall is high enough to permanently shield us from global problems. The Progressive Alliance wants to solve the problems!
A crazy feeling: I have just been nominated by the board of my party as candidate for chancellor. I am humble and grateful.
Nothing makes me more optimistic about the future of our democracy than the discussion with students. Was the same in Pinneberg today.
In autumn the Bocholt SPD leader resigned because of death threats. Today I am choosing his successor. Together we stand against it!
The SPD&#39;s Hessen Summit 2017 is all about security. I&#39;m going to talk here. Security must also mean protecting everyone socially!
"My father came from Saarland, he was a miner there. It is a matter of honor that I visit the SPD here today at its party conference. Good luck for!"
I&#39;m not saying goodbye to Europe today. Nor will I turn to German domestic politics tomorrow. It all belongs together.
Resigned my mandate as MEP with effect next week. It was 23 great years. A big thank you to everyone!
Thank you for your time - and above all for your great commitment! https://twitter.com/koelnspd/status/826739216478519296…
My conclusion after the first full working day in the Willy-Brandt-Haus: A lot of enthusiasm. Nice people. Awesome party. (But I knew beforehand.)
I thank you. For trust. For the support. For this day. Thank you. And tomorrow we heat up the black!
Those who work hard for decades deserve a pension well above the basic pension! That&#39;s why I&#39;m running for the solidarity pension.
I want to abolish the unreasonable limitation of employment contracts and introduce a solidarity pension well above the basic security.
