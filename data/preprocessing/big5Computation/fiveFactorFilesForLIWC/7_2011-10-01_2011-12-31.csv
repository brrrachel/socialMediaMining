@DerBruesseler reversal not allowed - no logic!
@JoernPL @larsklingbeil what&#39;s soft about it? All BVG requirements must be met!
"@alvar_f @joernpl @boehningb I can live with the position well, contains most of my arguments! That&#39;s why some tweet amazes me."

"Data about who is on the phone with whom and when = much less sensitive than what is allowed: eavesdropping, opening the mail, searching + for the same hurdles!"
Data accumulate anyway. For companies with costs not useful. Prohibition of exploitation and destruction requirement after 3 months with sanction!
"Of course, data misuse or security deficiencies must be punished severely - this is part of the law!"
"@Partigefluster providers collect tel. Data, which they must in my opinion after 3 months. annihilate, no access allowed, except with judge orders!"

@JoernPL would be happy if a differentiated debate were possible instead of homicide arguments. Have nothing to do with law &amp; order attitude!
@AlexSchestag am strictly against total surveillance! Strictly limit access rights is my position - but there are cases where access is necessary!
"@DerBruesseler All data addresses, telephone data, vehicle data, bank data, health data are saved - access conditions are crucial!"
"@DerBruesseler my state does not want access to data of all citizens, but only access under narrow conditions with judge reservation!"

@DerBruesseler for advertising purposes threaten data security more than the state - beyond the cases of abuse that also exist in the state like Dresden.
@DerBruesseler 10% or so demand individual connection evidence from their telecommunications service providers themselves. Citizens themselves + companies
"@DerBruesseler this is less serious than eavesdropping and some things that are currently allowed are monitored online, for example."
@DerBruesseler and for which crimes they have to surrender and that more restrictively than current EU law requires.
"@TheBrussels companies have data, it&#39;s about how long they have to keep them + under which strict conditions such as a judge&#39;s reservation"
"@DerBruesseler already term VDS is misleading - that is one of the problems. The state does not store any data, it is about something else!"
"@tomaschek is always discussed- EU specification goes too far, very different positions of domestic and network politicians.Will good compromise!"
@ victor5679 didn&#39;t see that.
@JoernPL that is nonsense - I&#39;m not talking about internet presentations but about a few serious crimes where this is an option.
@DerBruesseler therefore you have to regulate it clearly in the law - that cannot be interpreted otherwise!

In the Metrokino in Kiel an exciting preview of the Kiel &quot;crime scene&quot; &quot;Borowski and the cool dog&quot;. Strong film and nice evening.
Democracy didn&#39;t even come from Greece - there was something there! It&#39;s about nothing less than primacy of politics over financial industry.
Papandreou&#39;s brave move disturbs Merkel &amp; Sarkozy. Since when have conditions for financial capital been allowed to be decided democratically?
Added value in SH a la Carstensen &amp; Kubicki: Las Vegas on the fjord via call for illegal poker lobby - one suspects which business is following.
"Black and yellow lobbyist government in SH praises itself for gambling shark acquisition. Next, probably red light district job miracle!"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Promises to be a good day. Music tip: Trogg&#39;s &quot;Wild thing&quot;. Make something of it!
Was an event of church and science with quite different understanding of social market economy with CDU and SPD.
After a parliamentary group meeting in Flensburg in Eckernförde with deJager discussing business and morals-exciting-now party council Kiel.
@ victor5679 joking in the early morning? Union and act ... weakest government in decades
"Nuclear power, compulsory military service, school system + minimum wage: copy and paste. Angela Merkel rules according to the Guttenberg method, and connoisseurs appreciate the original!"
The party council then met in Kiel in the evening.
"In addition to the parliamentary group meeting in Flensburg, there was also discussion with CDU top candidate de Jager on ethical questions of politics in Eckernförde."

With the SPD parliamentary group today in Flensburg and Glücksburg. Visit to the campus and talk to local politicians.
"It&#39;s funny how Merkel now wants to use minimum wages in an electoral tactical way. Voters are not stupid, they know the original!"
"@KonstantinNotz Relatively simple: SPD has always fought for fair wages, Union has fully + copied the pants related to the election campaign # SPD = Original +++"
Music tip today: Reinhard Mey &quot;Autumn thunderstorm over the roofs&quot;.

@DerBruesseler you don&#39;t necessarily have to sit up to European fundamentalism with its political majorities!
"After the policy change on May 6, 2012 in SH, the common good again applies before sticky lobbyist order policies and the like. SH joins gaming contract!"
Endless embarrassment. SH still on ghost driver course against 15 countries in gambling. Carstensen &amp; Kubicki agents in the poker lobby.
"Today also citizen consultation in Bordesholm. Then I started my tour of the district associations in Neumünster, preparing for the party conference and elections."
What a beautiful dawn on this wonderful autumn morning!

Hamburg
Interesting energy policy symposium in the Berlin Willy-Brandt-Haus in memory of the unforgettable Hermann Scheer.
@martinhabersaat should the PHC have learned something from us? There are still signs and wonders taking place!
"@pgausn in SH it is difficult to argue differently - I&#39;m also for Husum, the problem is more state government than HH!"
@dieGoerelebt what is problematic about articles?
"On the A7 towards Hamburg and on the Ringo Starr radio with &quot;Photograph&quot; - particularly beautiful. Sun struggles through clouds, hoarfrost on meadows."
Problems between neighboring countries cannot be solved by talking like Carstensen a la provincial elephant in a china shop.
It&#39;s a good thing that Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz took the initiative to talk to MP Carstensen about wind fair. Right way!
Music tip: Al Jarreau &quot;Ain&#39;t no sunshine&quot;. Happy Friday and the opposite of the title wanted!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. To Berlin to energy politics. Commemoration of the great Hermann Scheer, who died a year ago."

Good morning from Bordesholm. Very autumn market before breakfast. Music tip: Chi Coltrane &quot;Let it ride&quot;. Have a nice weekend!
@DrAndreasNick what was wrong with my remark? That GDR citizens fought for unity? Gorbachev prevented violence? Oh: Kohl&#39;s black box office!
"@ aotto1968_2 Willy Brandt fought with courage and perseverance for reconciliation with the East, for peace and détente in the Cold War!"
And Gorbachev did not ensure that this remained peaceful.
Always read the suggestion to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the black box office. What for? German unit fought for GDR citizens!
Very convincing decision of the Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize to three African women’s rights activists!
Music tip: Rolling Stones &quot;Tell me&quot;. Happy Friday everyone!
Good morning from Hanover. Second day of the group leaders&#39; conference. Exchange with colleagues always good! Media inquiries about Berlin.
At the SPD parliamentary group chairperson conference in Hanover. Good working weather = continuous heavy rain!
It is hardly understandable for third parties that people voluntarily disgrace themselves in parliament like coalition speakers in the debate on right-wing populism!
"CDU + FDP underground level in right-wing populism debate in the SH state parliament. The mind is clearly on the left, as Thomas Mann said."
Hardly: MP Carstensen does what ??? “@ myBordesholm: Since 1.10. SH is at the helm at the Prime Ministers&#39; Conference: http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/STK/DE/Startseite/Artikel/111004_VorsitzMPK.html… ”
The singer&#39;s politeness is silent about almost three percent party anyway!
"Reasonable and progressive alternative in SH and Bund, where black and yellow is dead as a mouse, remains red green. Union urgently needs opposition!"
Conservative commentators are looking forward to Berlin coalition development and smell the morning air. Black and yellow totally failed in SH + Bund!
Later to the group chairman conference in Hanover. Happy Thursday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. It is still dark, yet again the state parliament today with a debate on right-wing populism. Music tip: Amy MacDonald &quot;Mr.Brightside&quot;."
@padmodi CO-2 landfill.
With whom can the best and most social-democratic politics be implemented - that is cardinal question and regionally different.
"I do not see any fundamental importance: SH + in the federal government has completely exhausted CDU / FDP governments up for election, Berlin had good governance."
"The failure of red-green in Berlin is widely discussed. Regional decision, because apparently stable coalition was not possible for 5 years."
"Long plenary day with CCS debate and black and yellow whistle coalition, which basically blames its own failures on the evil SPD."
Good morning from Bordesholm. The state parliament&#39;s plenary week begins today. CCS debate and others. Music tip: Me &amp; Me &quot;Stark&quot;. Nice Wednesday!
Annual reception of the state press conference in Molfsee with ducks and small talk - but also mood signals towards the turning point!
Good morning from Bordesholm.Working week begins.Faction prepares parliament. Music tip: REM &quot;Everybody hurts&quot;. Nice day!
@ Hollye73 sounds good!
"In the end, a deserved 4: 2 for Bordesholm, son Simon as a right-back with solid performance."
TSV Bordesholm-Vineta Audorf at halftime 2: 2. Rather mixed what the home team has been offering so far.
Nice walk through the canned bog. Holiday. Autumn. Good air.
"@bueti na na, it&#39;s a nice story, good for the red stocks!"
Many thanks also to my Twitter timeline for so many kind wishes for my birthday yesterday! Great weather-good omen!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. After a great Sunday yesterday, today also a great holiday! Music tip: Alphaville &quot;Forever young&quot;."

"Thank you for the many + nice congratulations! If the birthday weather is omen for the new year, it can only be good!"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Long and nice autumn weekend! Music tip: Van Morrison &quot;At the sunny side of the street&quot;. Nice day!
"@KonstantinNotz in SH flirt some Greens with the Union, not the SPD - the voters will make their own rhyme."
"If ... “@ bueti: If the SPD subsequently unilaterally changes appointments, it does not mean that the Greens negotiated badly."
Such nonsense: “@ KonstantinNotz: In Schleswig-Holstein there is just as much danger for a CDU-SPD coalition as in Berlin.
@manomama Happy Holidays!

@laszloriedl hope dies last ...; -}
@frolueb strange sympathy for the gambler industry and lobby for partly illegal activities.
FDP foams because it fails to divide the SPD in opposition to the unfortunate SH gambling law. # PolitikwechselSH2012
@knuddellove you have to warm up differently; -}
@muehlenwind was much more about the appearances of Westerwelle and Rösler at the Frankfurt party congress and in the Lindner resignation.
"@muehlenwind if you read the isolated sentence, you could misunderstand it as racist - that was really not what was meant!"
"@muehlenwind was not generally disregarded against Mr. Rösler, referred to a very unfortunate appearance after Lindner&#39;s departure."
Come from discussion at Deutschlandfunk with Prof. Decker + Mr. Koppelin from the FDP about the condition of black and yellow according to Wulff &amp; Rösler &amp; Co.
Music tip: Rod Stewart &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it&quot;. Happy Friday everyone!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Stormy return from the west coast yesterday evening.
"Friendly conversation with students as well as Ms. Koppelmann and Ms. Mangold as well as parents&#39; representatives, Mr. Wilken and Bgm.Breitner."
RD community school deserves support. Good school offer in the region with the goal of not leaving any children behind. Very convincing!
Altstadt Community School in Rendsburg: Very committed school management and obviously great educational work - should be an all-day school!
Rendsburg traffic jam delayed my schooling this morning.
Music tip: Two of us &quot;Blue Night shadow&quot;. Happy Thursday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today school attendance in Rendsburg, Kiel office appointments and at the SPD district association Dithmarschen in Heide."
"After appointments in the State House and a group of visitors from Steinburg, now at the SPD KV Rendsburg-Eckernförde. Very good mood after party congress!"
“@Spdde: A special program for #spdbpt &gt;&gt; http://bit.ly/uzsVKP ran on ARD last night”. It was good!
"SPD is center-left and so is the tax concept. Therefore, compromise and unanimous (!) Voting on it was a huge success! SPD +++"
The new tax and finance concept of the SPD is very progressive and contains many things that Heide Simonis and I proposed in 2004.
Today appointments in Kiel and Rendsburg. Music tip: ENYA &quot;Wild child&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm, largely positive response to strong SPD federal party convention, and only a few define compromises in defeats."
Hamburg.
@DerBruesseler Anyone who reads the SPD decision and who is so qualified reveals more about himself than about the party criticized in this way.
@DerBruesseler
"Many thanks to my strong SPD SH delegation at the Federal Party Congress. Good decisions, great atmosphere! # PolitikwechselSH2012SPD +++++"
Party Congress unanimously follows my compromise proposal on the flat tax! Nice success at the end of a good party congress!
My proposal for the taxation of capital gains is accepted by Frank Steinmeier and seems to be capable of a majority at the party conference!
Music tip: Sister Sledge &quot;We are a family&quot;. Happy St. Nicholas Day to everyone!
When tomorrow comes- that must be Annie Lennox + Eurythmics ... that helps with the bleak weather ... oh and the 3 points for HSV!
Everytime I see your face it reminds me on the places we used to go...;-}

@manomama Have a nice evening; -}
What a hectic day today! Now to Itzehoe to the SPD district association Steinburg. # PolitikwechselSH2012!
Left party wants to be able to coalition for SPD with Bartsch. In reality waves leave West Parliaments -FDP manages all of Germany!
The truth is simple: in reality they are delivered. SPD will stop this tax cut quark in the Federal Council!
Why should Social Democrats sponsor oxygen devices for seedy FDP? Had megalomaniac FDP promised to deliver.
Schäuble tries to lure SPD approval for nonsensical tax cuts with tax cosmetics. This is hopeless: nonsense remains nonsense!
At least that&#39;s how I read the media yield of the last week.
Over-productions usually go wrong - especially in politics. The &quot;Franconian Liar Baron&quot; has now also had to experience this.
@augensternchen_ I also wish that; -}
Notable article in today&#39;s ZEIT. &quot;Real Patriots&quot; describes the SPD to a large extent and in particular the European attitude!
Good morning from Bordesholm.Today jam-packed with appointments in Kiel + Itzehoe. Music tip: Mr.Acker Bilk &quot;Stranger on the shore&quot;. Have a nice day!

"&quot;Some of my lechts and rinks cannot be changed, what an illusion&quot;. (Ernst Jandl)"
"After an event at Wirtschaft UV Nord in Hamburg, I read the Christmas story of Heinrich Böll in front of seniors in Neustadt / Ostholstein."
Embarrassing speech by SH SME representative Arp (CDU) at UV Nord conference in HH. Case of foreign embarrassment. Self-praise instead of substance!
@hschmidt @derbruesseler @hansjoachimotto who still relies on FDP is to blame!
@DerBruesseler I do not speak for SPD other parties and about 2011.
@DerBruesseler I do not believe - otherwise commercial exploitation in SPD is never capable of a majority - definitely excluded for me!
"@DerBruesseler just because an FDP-Fritze says that, it does not come. I am there for a strictly punishable ban FDP will be voted out anyway!"
Happy November Ultimo Wednesday to all of you!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today appointments in Kiel and Hamburg and Advent reading in Ostholstein. Music tip: Paco &quot;Puttin &#39;on the Ritz&quot;
"Tough day today, which ended with a friendly conversation with the leadership of a likeable rival party. # PolitikwechselSH2012"
Apparent pose of self-criticism: &quot;I made mistakes and wrote crap&quot; - is a cipher for brazen plagiarism that has been exposed.
"Guttenberg book &quot;the sound of megalomania&quot;, as STERN rightly writes. Previous publications defy description."
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today in Kiel the dates of the faction and party. Music tip: Steve Harley &quot;Make me smile&quot;. Have a nice Tuesday!
