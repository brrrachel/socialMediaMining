Who was the climate minister for the past 4 years and who was her spokesman ???? 😕
Good for Europe. Good for Germany: we move closer together and solve the problems together. Urgent &amp; better than expected!
The trilogue with the EP on Clean Energy (Renewables / 32 and Efficiency / 32.5) was successful. Good for climate protection! Thanks @MAC_europa!
"How do you know? As a new Wi-Minister, 4 weeks ago I significantly increased our offer compared to the last GrKo."
