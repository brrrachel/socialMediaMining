I think this is a false criticism of the #antisemitism of this act of labeling. Anti-Semitism is based on two standards: the areas occupied and annexed by Israel since 1967 are the only controversial areas where there is such a regulation.

Why are you bringing @SawsanChebli into play now? What does it have to do with the EU&#39;s unilateral labeling requirement? She is the representative of the State of Berlin to the Federal Government and State Secretary for Civic Engagement.

"In fact, I criticized the Commission: what comes here legally and bureaucratically in the guise of consumer protection is really foreign policy. However, the responsibility for this lies not with the ECJ, but with the Commission."
Just for background: Israel has annexed the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. The former is recognized by the United States.
Where is there something about product labeling? The ECJ only prohibited the EU from playing the economic use of the occupied territory in the interests of the occupying power (vulgo: settlers). That that was previously the undisputed policy of the EU speaks volumes.
This is wishful thinking https://www.tv7israelnews.com/iran-refuses-to-cooperate-with-iaea/…

You are barred from this clear commitment to the secondary anti-Semitism of the neo-Nazis and Revanchists.

Found the mistake: anti-fascism is democracy and not extremism. So Sharepic is extremely wrong!
the assassin from Halle is imported? From where?
during that time he did not even properly include anti-Semitism in the messed up § 46 (2) StGB.
"Just to remind you what Intifada means: 1. Intifada: 1,162 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces. 160 Israelis killed by Palestinian forces."
We can only repeat this counterfactual nonsense of &quot;have no place in our society&quot; from the phrase threshing machine again and again. The task is to contest the space or to push it back. They negate the everyday life of anti-Semitism in D.
It would be something similar that the assassin would also say: resistance and such. Do not justify murders of Jews - intifada.

Anti-Semitism fantasizes his object at the same time as overpowering and inferior.
"Everyone has the same dignity, the same rights and the same right to protection of life. Nonetheless, anti-Semitism is not a form of racism, it is much older, much more rooted in our culture and it claims to have a model of world explanation ready."
"yes, nevertheless their license is wrong. It makes a difference whether you say that the state of injustice does not mean ... or was not an injustice state."

Right-wing anti-Semitism also thrives on the humus of everyday anti-Semitism and in the middle of society.
