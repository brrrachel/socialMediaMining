"The second day of the state plenary session also went clearly to the SH government coalition of SPD, Greens and SSW. Opposition alarmingly weak!"
@erik_fluegge there is no jubilation - you always have to fight for majorities for your own conviction - if you have one!
@edelschwarz get well soon; -}
Civilized but committed debate within and between parties is and remains the salt of democracy. The majority decides!
Real parliamentarianism is much better than its reputation - I say that as a friend of passionate and controversial and polemical debates.
"But for that you have to work, acquire competence and - yes - be very old-fashioned - be able to convince others in the real world or be able to compromise!"
"In spite of all party politics, good arguments can also be used to gain majorities or create common ground."
"However, the core of parliamentarianism remains the oral debate on important questions of state politics - there pirates have a blank."
Transparency is important - this is what SH Landtag offers for those interested - Internet use for everyone - paperless plenary in preparation.
@Magirus no-tomorrow too.
The matter today is about tariff loyalty law - another piece of policy change. Respect for good work instead of CDU &amp; FDP dumping wages.

@JuergenWeberMdL the old man was really right!
@belzig there maybe - the financial center of Germany is not an argument for ways beyond the common good #crisis teaching
Then you read that tax evasion is self-defense against the exuberant state. Apparently the judiciary is still too soft here!
"Certain circles have always been annoyed when lucrative business in Zurich, Vaduz, Luxembourg or elsewhere was disrupted."
Millions of dollars in tax evasion with the help of banks is immoral - not the fight against it.

"But we don&#39;t want to add value based on the Las Vegas principle. We want honest work in SH, not paradise for money launderers!"
There are problems with EU law only because the CDU &amp; FDP in SH opposed the rest of the republic to satisfy lobbyists.
