"To all the journalists I meet at the #Bundespresseball right away: I still have no numbers, no turnout, no interim results, I don&#39;t know who wins and yes, the SPD remains one and together. And: Hansi Flick is a great trainer. Any other topics? 😎🙃"

"The games industry is booming. Anyone who supports them will invest in one of the strongest growth areas of the next few years, in innovation &amp; jobs here in D. This great potential is worth it that the federal government is constantly promoting here. Thanks to @ JensZimmermann1 &amp; @kahrs for your commitment!"
👉 The # game funding is coming 🎉 I have been committed to this for a long time and also ensured that it was included in the coalition agreement! It&#39;s a good thing that the projects are finally being implemented consistently. It&#39;s not just about computer games ⬇
It is a very important decision! Thank you @ JensZimmermann1 and @kahrs https://twitter.com/JensZimmermann1/status/1195088177637330949…

"Civil society organisations that counter hate speech need constant political and financial support. Furthermore, democratic political institutions and civil society should better coordinate their activities e.g. rapid reactions against hate campaigns or disinformation campaigns."
"There are groups like #ichbinhier whose members counter hate speech with facts & boost respectful comments with likes.
I'm also happy that our @spdde launched Faktenfunk - debunking fake news spread by the far right.

"Hate speech is designed to intimidate those who fight for solidarity. It's goal is to spread hate & ultimatively divide society. We mustn't let these haters succeed!

It&#39;s best to get out of the trench a little. I have sat with everyone several times and it is all in solidarity. There is no one “red cloth”. The teams treat each other in solidarity. There is no division either. It is a competition for ideas.

"I have informed that the party executive and the presidium will not make election recommendations. That&#39;s how it should be. And I advised the branches not to do that either, board members and working groups. But everyone can say what he thinks."

with pleasure.
You can now intentionally twist it. My perception is: the mainstream didn&#39;t look to the right.
"Nah, I described how the social mainstream was. The fact that we had public statements (including decisions by the Presidium, statements to Chemnitz etc.) where many have pointed out is something else."
"I answered the question whether politics and society as a whole underestimated it. And then I say: yes. And I see it that way too. Regardless of the fact that many initiatives (and I, too) have repeatedly pointed this out. The mainstream was different."
"If you want to read the quote like this, you can read it like that. But it can also be read as a description of a social reality. I perceived it that way. It always bothered me. But she was like that."
do you think the responsible authorities saw this? De Maziere? Seehofer? Maassen? Sorry that was often played down. I have now really often pointed to the right at an early stage. But you ran into a wall often enough.

Philipp!
Do you think that enough has been done against right in Germany in recent years? I don&#39;t have that opinion. That is what I said. You don&#39;t have to share.
that will surely solve the problem. I believe that we have done too little as a society against the right in recent years. I have often pointed this out. Can you see otherwise that more should have been done.
Thank you
"If you think enough has been done against the right in recent years, ok. I see it differently. And I stick to the opinion."
"Do you think social and political awareness has been strong enough in recent years? Not me. As someone who is intensely involved in the fight against the right, I was extremely disturbed. I&#39;ll stick with it."
Oh thank you. I like to read @derrechtand very often. Do you think that enough has been done against the right in recent years? Not me. I think too many have looked away. I stick to the opinion.
