The #EuropeanVoice got it wrong. Resolution or not is formal issue. What counts is the clear #decision on #substance!  http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/majority-of-meps-vote-against-plan-to-withdraw-air-and-waste-proposals/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=alert&utm_campaign=Majority+of+MEPs+vote+against+plan+to+withdraw+air+and+waste+proposals …
"&quot;#Rethinking, Mr. Vice President @TimmermansEU!&quot; My comment on an important # EP decision. http://goo.gl/BHYtVj #betterregulation"
@Frederiqueries That is not true. Only a few of my colleagues objected to the language of the oral amendment. Otherwise it had been stopped.
"After these clear EP decisions, 3x by name, VP #Timmermans has zero #legitimation for his anti-ecological advances. @JunckerEU"
#EP voted against the Commission&#39;s intention three times today to withdraw # regulation on # air quality and # circular economy.

Green news from Greece: Green Yiorgos Dimaras has been elected to the Greek parliament on the Syriza list. Probably the only green seat.
Quote of the Day! #Russian Ambassador Grinin on Russian foreign policy: &quot;We have no delusions of grandeur.&quot; - Just! It&#39;s the new normal.

@Konrad Yes. Do you want to know exactly? Then ask @JanAlbrecht.

Chatter in Europ. Houses of Parliament. #Reul (CDU) on economic #governance in the EU: Each country can solve its own problems if it makes an effort.
"Does anybody in the #EP know what ""lend-lease"" means? Do we really want to vote for exchanging #arms for #NATO bases on the #Russian border?"
"Draft text of #EP #Ukraine resolution: ""provide #defensive #arms to Ukraine, which could be based on a 'lend-lease' kind arrangement;"" WHAT?"
Energy in Europe Houses of Parliament. #Tusk: Energy Union is not just about #renewables. Because it&#39;s about security. Ich: Therefore renewables!
