"Because of all the work behind the scenes, only sporadic Twitter activities."
Kita Bexbach: There is rapping for the inauguration. Something new!
Present with &quot;AKS documentation&quot; &quot;school rooms&quot; as part of the competition. SL role model when using IZBB funds.
As always: SPD &quot;traffic lights&quot; to the outside and &quot;blushes&quot; to the inside. Recommend comment &quot;Cicero&quot; on the Internet.
Congratulations to JU on the good state parliament. I&#39;m on my way to the LJO in Saarbrücken. Yesterday rock today classic. Variety is a must.
Yesterday at Wustock &quot;Roxette&quot; great police cover band. Now to the Peterberg observatory. Looking ahead ?!

Just see Peter Müller Magazin: Simply really good!
"Yesterday evening at &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;: MP greeted with applause, surrounded by people, Maas alone in front of a tent. Even SPD liver with Peter Müller"
"Long, successful WK day comes to an end. Last glass of sangria on the terrace. We&#39;ll keep fighting tomorrow."
Totally crowded hall at Minister vdLeyen. We live family!
"With colleague vdLeyen in the multi-generation house Nonnweiler. Great atmosphere, sweet babies. Why were comrades on site at MGH?"
Too bad that Münte lost its character and decency in attacks on Merkel. The situation of the SPD must be very desperate.
Hot phase WK can be taken literally this week. Sweat!

Latest smell:
On the way to Canvassing Eiweiler. I am looking forward to successful mayor Hermann Baer.
"Info booth Markt VK. Good weather, good mood. Visits from Duel Gester: MP winner on points."
Unanimous opinion even after the event: Peter Müller clear boss in the ring and clear point winner. Heiko &#39;Smart&#39; doesn&#39;t do it.
SPD panic campaign at its peak: Regardless of the feelings of parents and children. But hard-heartedness in school books! Dishonest!
Today with PMT song &quot;5 more&quot; on the way. Real catchy tune and the right music for a full WK final sprint day.
"Funky, crazy good !!! Halle bursts at the seams, mood boils, own song. This is the final sprint!"
Urgent application rejected! OK then!
To Ulli C.: After Beckmesserei now small-minded German fraternity! And that from Tweetie in Web 2.0? Frightening!

Lafo Interview II: At least he takes Heiko on his lap so that he can rule a little with red-red.
Maas admits that Müller has more glamor than he does. That&#39;s right!
Maas cannot even use the questions asked.
Maas cannot score even in educational policy.
MP knows federal politics. Maas confuses the FDP and CDU programs.
Between WK appointments &quot;normal&quot; ministry work. Tonight at MP at BILD. Over 1000 registrations for Gutenberg. We have the draft horses!
"Education Parents Survey. Not really new results. Reservations against federalism are not new, shows how important cooperation is."
Speaking of lawsuit against BGM Schiffweiler because of child porn. Wouldn&#39;t it be time to step back now? What does the SPD say in the country?
Canvassingstand in the rain. It also works. We are not a fair weather party!
So the battle is fought for today.
Funny pick-nick round in Kumipark. Life is one of the most beautiful.

Brizzled in a giant Lyons pan. Mordagaudi. Now fairground ice cream in Hülzweiler.
Maas says in the column that I have school closure plans in my drawer. Can search my desk. Pathetic Maas!

Campaign meeting on site for the coming week. Now a short break and tonight &quot;Ran an der Pann&quot;.
So distributed with my OV election prospectuses. Like in old times. Now ending with the CDU and MP at the Riegelsberger Marktfest.

SZ today: Everyone wants the 4th Pav. - somehow! But we are building it!
Visit to the Schmeer sand pit. Flagship entrepreneur economically and ecologically.
Was just on holiday program Warndtgymn. in the forest. I have been fed witch herb and have a homemade clay pack on my face.

Off to the topping-out ceremony Waldorf Kindergarten WND. New nursery places. LK and city WND far above the national average.
Drag summer cold around with me. Pull through anyway.
akk to Knauber: MaasJa can not have a say. Although wasn&#39;t he there somehow?
Discussion MP over. First reactions: victory across the board for Peter Müller.
Where do they meet in Berlin. In the phone booth?
Difficult and hectic (and painful) day so far. Hope for a quiet evening and keep my fingers crossed for discussion.
Sit in the dentist&#39;s waiting room and wait for the things to come!
Delayed on the way to Kita Freisen. A good friend in severe crisis took time and attention. This is going on.
Back home after Harry Potter and last Twitter check. To the Sz comment: There is probably a father of thought at SZ and SPD Wunsch.
"Productive day today. Much of the private life finally left behind. Relax now with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young!"
Wow. What speeches. Koch and Müller in top form. Content and rhetoric are only available from the CDU.
Lafontaine interview as usual. Transfigured itself as the most successful MP ever. Why was the SL so bad at the time?
"Nice hike, great weather and about 400 fellow hikers."
Short stop at the dentist. Now hiking shoes laced up and with MP on St. Wendler Runde.
The daycare center Wiesbach was awarded the title &quot;Singing Kindergarten&quot;. Great job of the educators. Target cleaning is correct.
"MaasAnd the HBK: Either he didn’t notice anything culturally, or don’t want any cultural buildings. He as head of culture? Horror."
Preparation of groundbreaking for 4th pav. I am glad that it will start soon.
An Knauber: More instructive than unsuspecting!
Further development of the cultural scene: Today&#39;s next step with the groundbreaking of the university gallery.

Too bad. 2: 0th That’s it.
"Freiburg press ahead, but missed great opportunity from SVE. Too bad."
SVE is fighting. Has a good chance before a break. Has hope for the second half.
Crap. 1-0 for Freiburg. Now Elversberg has to fight.
Especially on the radio: Münte gives the green light for red-red in Saarland. Maas should finally show its colors instead of playing around.
Off to Elversberg. Hope for a cup surprise in 90 minutes. Must be tapped at 6 p.m.
Maas interview. He is servant. Everyone conspired. In IHK he is not allowed to have a say in the Müller-Lafo duel. Oh!
Very good information event with residents about the 4th pavilion. Because of Melcher and not communicative!
Good news from the training market. More training contracts despite the crisis.

"Read in the media: LInke Tour by Stegner in Schleswig-Holstein. I&#39;m not surprised, I still know him as a colleague of the interior ministers."
They still exist: lectures that no longer let anyone in half an hour before the start due to overcrowding in the hall. I&#39;m curious what ...
Heimatmusem Steinbach run with love. Shows how necessary and good the village renewal initiative by Stefan Mörsdorf is.

Tour family festival madness. First coffee break. Then part two.
"A lot of work, but it works. Good news school book, positive feedback house scanning, interesting preview exhibition."
"In the case of appointments, praise from teachers and autograph requests from students. Hope SPD does not file a complaint because of unauthorized election advertising."
Nice school ceremonies at ERS Illingen and GS Ensdorf. School book rental is very popular. Hope regional association decides iS of the children.
Back to School! It will probably take a few days until everyone has got used to everyday life again. Also applies to your own family.
On the road ... for a WK day that will be long and offers everything from church choir to fire brigade to bike tour.
"3000 steps campaign at the STSB. After that, all the calories consumed with Lanfrauenkuchen more than compensated."
"Good mood at stands, shaking heads about dirt campaign v.Maas. Despair of comrades must be great."
On Saarland and more: 10 to 12% before SPD is definitely tailwind!
