Maybe we&#39;ll talk past each other. There were a lot of older people on the demo train who thought that the students would just join in so that they wouldn&#39;t have any lessons. So you could understand their point. But then everything is clear

"No, 3FA would be desirable, for example, but nobody sees it as a legal requirement"

"But that you exceed the legal requirements and also in markets that do not require it by law, you should advertise with confidence. Example: belt = law, airbag = advertising, super hypo foam = protective innovation"
Data protection was introduced to protect fundamental rights long before data processing could make big profits
And then the manufacturers advertise their security measures beyond the legal requirements. I wish for IT security and data protection
Is at least a fact
This is where the comparison between the analog and digital world comes into play. Credible data protection does not have to be more expensive
"If I knew which of two products would treat my data really fairly, that would be an important decision-making aid for me, i.e. a competitive advantage for those who take data protection seriously"

"And do you accept that I don&#39;t want this and therefore don&#39;t want to be spied on when I take the bus to the department store just because the bus operator has a contract with the department store? In the future, you can use a browser that gives you invisible consent to everything"
"That would be stupid with the form, which is why I refrain from spying on you, because then I don&#39;t need your consent"
The ruling was about website operators letting a third party (FB) collect personal data just because someone was heading to their website. Before this person can even recognize that important data is being collected. That was never the goal of laws
"Limited number of characters, therefore shortened. But that FB has no legitimate interest, contractual, legal or other basis, to access my data just because I open a website, should be clear. This is about consent, says the EUGH"
"Polemic counter-question: If department store owners had previously sent a watchdog behind them to write everything down and search their wallet, would you have described this as necessary and assumed that opponents of this practice would deprive you of your freedom?"
Those are the appointments that last several days. It&#39;s about making short meetings via video conference instead of letting people travel across the country

"No, but we are active, e.g. as German data protection authorities with pressure on and delivery to the Irish data protection authority, which is responsible for Facebook"
"GDPR enforcement already makes a lot possible, but we need an ambitious ePrivacy regulation for this particularly sensitive area"
"One level less polemical, please, that with the (fake) Marie Antoinette quote is irrelevant. Enter Kelber and Facebook in a search (there are alternatives), then you will see what I am doing - within the framework of the existing laws"
"I have already understood. But even after we enforce the GDPR against Facebook &amp; Co., there are other reasons to evade the oligopoly"
Adopt an ambitious ePrivacy regulation in the version of the EU COM and Parliament. But we also talk to the Data Ethics Committee about management tools and mandatory interfaces

Then just set &quot;All approval&quot; in a browser add-on. Many others and I don&#39;t want to be spied on without being asked
But you have to respond to my argument that there will be no more all-consent. Why should people consent to something that is not necessary for the desired service and that wants separate consent?
Such decisions will come soon
And what do the clients do if you tell them that consent is not possible?
"You only need a long consent text as a provider if you want to collect much more data than is actually required. In other words: the longer the data protection declaration or the approval text, the more suspicious I will be"
"This law exists, the GDPR. And must now be enforced. Accessing data for which there is no legal basis for collecting is prohibited. The EUGH has just decided in the case of FashionID and FB. And can be transferred 1: 1"
"Consent must be specific, informed and voluntary. Consent, for example, for data transmission to FB must be uncoupled from consent for other things. You notice that quickly as a user, which is why corporations try to avoid it"
"Comprehensive consent in the interests of the company can quickly become invalid, because consent must be concrete, informed and voluntary. Obtaining consent for all sorts of things in order to make use of something can violate this"
"Oh, when it comes to prejudice, I get out of discussion. As a (formerly) red data protection activist and graduate computer scientist with US relatives, I must now indulge my phobia of technology and my anti-Americanism. Don&#39;t you have it smaller?"

That explains the difference: I was referring to the specific case
"And let&#39;s put it this way: if the headquarters were in Germany, the issue would most likely have been solved"
"Fortunately, that is not the problem. Website operators are not allowed to collect data until they have given their consent (or other legal basis). In connection with the coupling ban, this can be a strong point."
"Yes and no! Not when requesting UIG. But already when asked whether, for example, sensitive data was requested in an unsecured way. So feel free to lodge a complaint, we will check whether the GDPR is applicable or - as is often the case with BND - special legislation"
