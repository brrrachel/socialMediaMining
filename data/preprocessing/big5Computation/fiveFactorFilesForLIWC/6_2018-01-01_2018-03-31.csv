I do not understand what you mean ... 😎😌
I&#39;m curious

Good morning :) pic.twitter.com/TFWru4g9iv
Congratulations 👍🏻 https://twitter.com/spdhh/status/977536096279187457…
Good.
Everyone is treated equally.
It is a dangerous language that you use.
&quot;The top&quot; - great language!
Very right decision. Wait and see who is a candidate or nominee and then let everyone have their say on the party board. Don&#39;t understand your problem ...

Fine. Where do we beam the CDU / CSU students to?
Hi?
"I thought we beamed, dear @DoroBaer - too bad that you are so undemanding from the CSU with your #flugtaxis!"
I hope it gets a little calmer. but governing and renewing also becomes exhausting. if your question is still up-to-date: 0171 1575367 is directly on my cell phone - on the weekend i have a little time for open questions.
Exactly. There was a little bit going on ...
Yes and?

Good news from Bavaria: @NataschaKohnen was selected with 95% of the votes on list number 1 in the district of Upper Bavaria. Congratulations!
Thank you for the passionate debate of the past few weeks. Now: govern sensibly and renew the #SP.

Great premiere! Thumbs up 👍🏻 https://twitter.com/blnensemble/status/964965573997318144…
Yes. That was a mistake. Has come because two people are still up there at short notice. Must be changed for the upcoming events as well as the short speech portion of the critics.

Looking for the right Kettcar quote ...
Shaping a new European awakening. This goal has driven @martinschulz. The coalition agreement provides the basis for this. The fact that he now defers personal ambitions so as not to jeopardize this goal speaks for him.
Did you read the forward interview?

Hello!
Did you find an answer to the question? Question for a friend.
I did

"Only the committees can decide that. And again: my red card refers to those who - no matter whether MdBs or something - now bring names for ministers into play again and again. I don&#39;t need it, it doesn&#39;t help."
A party congress decides on the question of who will become a Primary. The Presidium and the Primary can nominate someone.
Don&#39;t think ministers now have to speculate every day. I want to debate the content of the KoaV. The occupation of the cabinet can then be decided together.
I said that at an event in Hamburg.
I now want to discuss the contents of the coalition agreement and not read wild personnel speculations in the newspapers every day. Do you see differently?
We&#39;ll talk about it soon

Political groups have now occupied committees. And we currently have an executive federal government ...
The deadline is 2013 :)
There was also a deadline 4 years ago. Quite normal procedure. Local associations must be able to decide on the admission of new members. https://twitter.com/schorscheo/status/956126242637533184…
Thanks 🤜🏻🤛🏻
Thanks for the hint. I reacted to it.
"Embarrassing, colleague. An open and lively democratic discussion like the SPD is the best way against right-wing populists."
Today we showed how lively our party is. We will create even more participation opportunities for members in the future. There is no more exciting time to join the SPD. Tell your friends! #spderneuern
I linked it to the membership decision and the intra-party debate.
Thank you. Whereby &quot;big&quot; means: the controversial topics. We agreed that digitization must play a very large role in coalition negotiations.
Get well!

Congratulation!!!
There are umpteen topics that we haven&#39;t talked about in the 5 days.
"Do you think immigration law, billions for fiber, billions for education or climate protection law is out of date?"
Why is this not making our country stable?

Hello!
not even one of Bayern Munich?
"And otherwise there is streaming. You can criticize, but the tone should be right."
"We decided to hold a special party conference and my employees in the Willy-Brandt-Haus had to find a hall in a matter of days so that we could invite them on time. There are requirements. We have to adhere to them. In addition to the delegates, a few hundred guests can enter."
that we have to print more notes if there is a coalition agreement.
"Madness! 24,339 new members have joined our party since the New Year. The SPD thus had 463,723 members for the member vote on the cut-off date. I am glad that you are all there! Sp #spderneuern"

Ask me about the probes :)
We discussed digital platforms and decided at the party conference. We are now collecting ideas and taking the first steps in 2018.
What?
Thanks for the hint! I&#39;ll take a look at that.
