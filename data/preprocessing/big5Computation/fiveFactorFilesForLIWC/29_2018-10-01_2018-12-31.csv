The &quot;Center for Research on Anti-Semitism&quot; employs al-Quds-Tag activists and downplayed Muslim anti-Semitism. The ZfA renames what it is: a center for anti-Semitism.

"qed: #CSU loses the biggest chunks to the originals: if you want Merkel&#39;s no-border-no-nation politics, #Gender_und_Klima_Gaga and #Islam, you better choose the Green Original. And if you don&#39;t want all this, the blue one. #AfD #FriendlyChristianConservative pic.twitter.com/ZXHtyox2We"
Correctly! Green is the new red. And: Blue is the new black.
The &quot;grand coalition&quot; has fewer votes in Bavaria than the CSU in the last election in 2013 alone. The SPD was shredded. Rotgrün has as many votes as the SPD alone used to do. The #AfD moves into the 15th state parliament. Our streak of success continues. # ltwby2018

"Gender madness in the BT. #CDU and # Greens ideologically united. In fact, everyone should be free to choose their gender. They want to play God. Gender is a biological fate. The GG also only knows 2 genders and that&#39;s a good thing. #AfD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP0V8lgZ_vk…"

Union and SPD still together come to 41 percent. The Union used to have that much alone - with poor election results. There is only one thing left: merge.
