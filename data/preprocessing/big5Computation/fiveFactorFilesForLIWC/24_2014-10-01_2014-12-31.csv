@andreas_lenz was not meant as an accusation. But you won&#39;t get boring information that doesn&#39;t escalate through the media channel
"@andreas_lenz I unfortunately, up to death threats and castration requests."
@andreas_lenz But those who believe that politics have the power to convey everything via the media in order to get things right do not recognize the media
"@andreas_lenz Yes, but Democrats also have responsibilities. eg to get information. Doesn&#39;t want to be spiteful now."

"@andreas_lenz However, your misinformation was deliberately controlled in the media by interested parties."
"@andreas_lenz classic problem: new government, new politics and officials who don&#39;t feel like it."
@andreas_lenz You can tell that after the instruction you clapped the topic listlessly.

@andreas_lenz this harmless &amp; totally boring bureaucratic paper is also available somewhere on the net
@andreas_lenz was nothing more and the homophobic gang read and thought only SEX SEX SEX.

"@andreas_lenz Well, the spokesmen only have to listen to Kuby, Spieker, homo healers, authors of Junge Freiheit. quite tolerant"
"@andreas_lenz only with these people it was about sexuality, the education plan is about respecting different identities &amp; ways of life"
