@MarcoBuschmann what did she achieve?
@RAStadler and it can&#39;t be that another generation is slowly gaining ground in the SPD?
@MarcoBuschmann my question was: what has the black and yellow government changed specifically at European level?
"@MarcoBuschmann no, I thought: what did your black and yellow government do in Europe to revise the vds directive?"
@MarcoBuschmann have you changed the European directive?
"@JuLisOsnabrueck @MarcoBuschmann of course she is there! it is not implemented. at the european level, guidelines have to be changed."

@tirsales red with soldiers who have not been ambushed because of reconnaissance capacities. and stop with your insinuations.
@tirsales have you always made politics so cheap or is it just because you&#39;re afraid not to come to the Bundestag?
@tirsales who is in favor of reconnaissance capacities in foreign missions is for the use of armed drones against demonstrators? is clear...
@tirsales well then. I think it makes sense that we have reconnaissance capacities abroad.

Another quick event tip for next Monday in Hanover: the military officer and I discuss. http://www.fes.de/niedersachsen/common/pdf/2013/05_06_SiPol.pdf‚Ä¶
@ErhardScherfer now even I am speechless.
@ErhardScherfer take this pic.twitter.com/6lhOvfOIai
"dear @ErhardScherfer where did the nice, likeable profile picture of you go? that seems broken!"
@FlorianGathmann didn&#39;t even know that they had a taste in football ...
@Dunehopper still running?
@andreas_clever all well! that between @mathiasrichel and me is friendly arguing. actually we are both for the FCB.
@mathiasrichel then just wait quietly ...
@mathiasrichel you are nervous. madness.
@mathiasrichel nonsense. cuba has impure skin and rafinha has kindly shown him that. you see ghosts ...
"@mathiasrichel well, sammer had to fight back. klopp came into our zone like a madman. swam over it! we can forgive."
"no, BVB goes to the cl final quite relaxed. as this picture branches: pic.twitter.com/2B4xGLT1Dt"
@henningtillmann you sound a little like @peteraltmaier
@ henningtillmann I think so too! you played great this season. vice champion after all. behind us.
@henningtillmann we just wait for the 25th. don&#39;t be so nervous. otherwise you will still knock like that.
@ Netz30 is nice that @spdde congratulates seehofer on the nomination. but you can also queue up!
"@ victor5679 now both of us: was nothing, right? #csukonvent"
@ Well I&#39;m already following the CDU fanboy @ walli5 :)
"@DoroBaer you have to say that, doro!"
"if I read this right here on twitter, seehofers coronation fair went really wrong ... #csukonvent"
@ChristianHKuhn very good. Thank you.
follows @tante_mimi_love !!! #ff
@Daniel_Schwanz thank you very much
@Klusch_Andreas thank you!
dear @Nico - what does that mean? pic.twitter.com/Z42mTiYLE0
CSU campaign slogan leaked: &quot;Women and children first!&quot;
somehow the CSU misunderstood the childcare allowance: http://m.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/a-897724.html‚Ä¶
@netzlab does not open ...
at the @FESonline Academy I will discuss next week about &quot;living and working in the digital society&quot; - http://tinyurl.com/cbvbyo5
@ victor5679 he saw my sport picture ...
"if you want to open up a credit card for me, you shouldn&#39;t start the conversation with: &quot;hopefully lewandowski won&#39;t go to fcb&quot;."
win the final. for jupp! #wembley #fcbbvb
I'm at D√ºsseldorf Airport (DUS) (D√ºsseldorf) w/ 19 others  http://4sq.com/13OCnLp¬†
The new episode of @ MdB20 is running on phoenix today from 12h - have a look! I report on my constituency work.
@ZDF already has the new 5 euro notes. pic.twitter.com/R2WieleIVs
now sit at @ZDF in d√ºsseldorf. Around 10am I report full knowledge of the project @ MdB20 with @ManuelHoeferlin
@ walli5 you don&#39;t!
"@ walli5 oh man. in the past you were always funny, now you only do election campaigns :("
@ walli5 even 12 year olds have work! madness! upswing! :)
"ey, people were murdered by Nazis. in the middle of today&#39;s germany. and we have debates .... embarrassing."
"oh fine, my interior minister @borispistorius is on twitter. welcome!"
I can&#39;t watch it all. I keep reading my book.
watch the video of obamas at the white house correspondents dinner and then think of merkel. get in a bad mood :)
@ walli5 I&#39;m not on jauch! @nico
"with dual citizenship, i still have to think of roland koch&#39;s disgusting signature campaign. #berlindirekt"
@Nico was clear.
@mathiasrichel @nico Twitter is work!
@mathiasrichel don&#39;t get involved when adults are talking here! @nico
@Nico for whom are you actually in the CL final?
hey @Nico what about football?
@ Henningtillmann was glad that they did not write &quot;without football expertise&quot;.

@Infield_Johnson is very popular. send times by mail
"@ Peter tuber no, dear Peter with all appreciation. you did not want any legal anchoring and voted against!"
@ovoss @petertauber well last time the boys from @cnetz all voted against the legal anchoring. market should regulate and such.
Today is one of those days where I notice how many BVB fans there are in the group.
@ victor5679 @hildwin @hahnflo is right !!!!
@hildwin @hahnflo sometimes he&#39;s great

To whom can I actually send back this fake iPod that arrived at my office today to protest against the warning law?
I think @mathiasrichel and @henningtillmann won&#39;t like me anymore http://www.udldigital.de/lars-klingbeil-wie-ist-das/‚Ä¶
"welcome, @MarioGoetze #fcb"
@martindelius well you are reasonable. but the rest is a little overzealous :)
all the pirates are right in campaign mode.
@ henningtillmann be grateful! did a lot for you.
@fraeulein_tessa i can separate it.
"We wait @sachark. anyway, thought is good."
@sachark hello? BILD says that.
@FlowFXx is also a universal service in the election program. but it is more than business promotion.
The SPD has applied for the legal anchoring of net neutrality in the Bundestag and has enshrined it in the election program. And that&#39;s good!
"@bildesheim @derarndt @herr_arendt phew, I thought. already thought I have to like Tatort now // @LSMueller"
@bildesheim @derarndt @herr_arendt is @lsmueller like this?
@herr_arendt @bildesheim @derarndt we go there together. ick I&#39;m happy!
@herr_arendt @bundesliga_de @bildesheim @derarndt oh so. gl√ºchwunsch! 12 months first league :)
@derarndt @bildesheim @herr_arendt @bundesliga_de crime scene and hertha I find roughly the same bad.
@herr_arendt @bildesheim @derarndt @bundesliga_de huh?
@ t0xx1c jepp. yesterday was small &amp; secret. from may then a tour.
"well, today it&#39;s about scaring again, what?"
@themroc @mspro total nonsense. there is neither cheer from me nor @ petertauber. it&#39;s about communication. I refer to #eidg in terms of content.
@kattascha yes of course
"I'm at Eis Cafe Dal Bo (Munster, Lower Saxony)  http://4sq.com/11X1b3B¬†"
@mjk111 7 ;)
@sebweigle total nonsense. has nothing to do with #fcb // in the DFB cup final we knock your pickle away.
@sebweigle if what&#39;s right everywhere: crime. must be punished with all severity. doesn&#39;t change the greatness of #fcb!
@ppetenmensch @terryhoax jepp
@sebweigle the #fcb is a great club. mistakes made by individuals cannot question that.
see the great @TerryHoax tonight - happy
@ join13luck but not this article: http://m.spiegel.de/panorama/eople/a-894959.html‚Ä¶

"at the CDU, interns even get photos with ministers. great service! pic.twitter.com/5d143Wt4Z6"
dear @peteraltmaier what&#39;s going on here? http://m.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/a-894943.html‚Ä¶ - my region hoped that you would fight something here! #fracking
@hildwin stay out of there! we #rangle right now. @ walli5 @petertauber
"@petertauber haha. i insulted you your mother uses twitter, that&#39;s cool."
@ Petertauber of which you certainly have the few good sites. @ walli5
br√ºderle describes the purchase of tax CDs as stealing. madness. tax fraudsters are made here.
@kahrs what do you mean please?
@ walli5 what ruined you so much?
@ walli5 you don&#39;t need to hope!
the party board&#39;s security policy commission is now concerned with the future of internal leadership.
@ walli5 you are also such a CDU press officer ...
@herr_arendt 1860?
@herr_arendt @elawprof @dorobaer @petertauber @manuelhoeferlin not me!
"@ Hahnflo I am for quote and for childcare allowance. flo, that will be nothing ..."
@ Hahnflo I&#39;m red through and through! @FC Bayern
I make up my mind: we&#39;re going to Berlin! @FC Bayern
@hahnflo so @DoroBaer is just better there .. / @fcbayern
@DoroBaer haha. great. progress.
@hildwin that was not personal.

@dominikrzepka i thought discussion.
"@dominikrzepka and if I&#39;m right, apologize to the SPD in front of the camera. Deal;)"
@ victor5679 approval.
"@LucasGerrits @dominikrzepka ne, did not do the @OlafScholz."
@dominikrzepka the frustration remains too. and the SPD should have acted differently. But the content of your statement is still wrong.
@LucasGerrits @dominikrzepka joint application with baw√º.
@MlleYs I&#39;ll tell you tomorrow after taking up duty :) @marke_ich
