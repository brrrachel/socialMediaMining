"Well, maybe some large left flaps learn it here too. Right-wing, right-wing populist, radical right-wing and extreme right are not the same thing! Anyone who deliberately and purposely messes up is a bad politician, nothing more. #AfD #Poggenburg http://m.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/25983019…"
My criticism remains criticism and does not become a rush just because it does not fit into the left-autonomous world view!
Here!
It is disgusting that you are upset about the criticism and not about the deed! Typically left stupid?
"Review of the bloody deed in Kandel and right pointer to the co-responsible people, who thereby stir up hatred of foreigners among many citizens, which could be easily avoided with a little sense of responsibility and expertise! #AfD #NoMultiKulti #NoIslam http://www.pi-news.net/2018/01/die-kuppler-von-kandel/…"
"What do they have to do with my girlfriend and me and in any order? And no thanks, keep your intimate diseases to yourself!"
"I did, but you still commented stupidly left, so what&#39;s the point?"
So don&#39;t leave for #Antifa!
"Nice story with the #Nazis, but what does that have to do with the #AfD?"
&quot;Recently&quot; ... Somewhat messed up with the calculation of time and otherwise a bit jealous?
"Of course, where the AfD is like no other party for lowering the daycare fees, against child poverty, support for small and medium-sized businesses, etc. You are completely uninformed, but you stupidly nag. Left, right? Typical!"
"Well, we&#39;re excited! Though it&#39;s shameful how you play down Nazism."
"New Year reception of the sparkling wine cellar # Rotkäppchen in Freyburg / Unstrut in the #Burgenlandkreis. Quite good and pleasant words from District Administrator Götz Ulrich and Foreign Minister Siegmar Gabriel, which unfortunately did not match the bad and unpleasant real policies of the old parties. pic.twitter.com/pm3uiZD5cY"
"So there is no GroKo? If we do, we will automatically become opposition leaders! 😉"
"According to today&#39;s exploratory results from #CDU and #SPD, further pacting and the GroKo disaster should continue. The only bright spot for Germany: AfD becomes opposition leader! #AfDwirkt #Poggenburg 🇩🇪 pic.twitter.com/xAdyzXvXjf"
Oh you meant me? But where did I say something about war conditions? My god left stupid and confused ...
How do you get Oberlappen that &quot;Rosalinde&quot; wants to bring the country back !?
"Yes and? Nevertheless, I was never bankrupt and was never &quot;arrested&quot;. Back then everything was cleared up and good. Where exactly is your problem now? 🤔"
And you don&#39;t have any at the red border!
I have never been a bankrupt and paid late payments with interest in one sum. Where does this result in &quot;existence being ruined&quot;?
The AfD is on the wrong side because it criticizes the media coverage !? 🤔
You call ARD an enemy broadcaster and a lie press? Very insightful!
"You trivialize National Socialism, disgusting!"
"Foolish talk like you do, yes !?"
"Can only agree with him so far. Anyone who causes such damage to our society should one day be held accountable, of course within the framework of the rule of law!"
"Take a look at the video two posts further and give yourself peace, nobody wants to hear or read you anyway."
Compassion for the violent left-wing mob? Why should I!?
"But sure, two posts further, you little left-wing lie rascal ... 😄"
"For and to you, every word is a compliment! 😄 And yeah ... our AfD counter-rally was peaceful compared to the left-wing rabble. 😉"
"Then watch the video footage and keep your left mouth shut, okay?"
"Oh, so violence against those who think differently about politics is &quot;the good thing in people&quot;? 😂"
Have you already watched the video material? Stupid louse.
"&quot;Please refrain from throwing bottles or fireworks,&quot; the police said several times about the black block in Dessau. This in turn throws further and breaks the barrier. This is what &quot;peaceful funeral march&quot; looks like on the left! #AfD #NoAntifa 🇩🇪 pic.twitter.com/AopK0VHgeH"
The most disgusting is the left-wing extremist march with bottle and firecrackers on the anniversary of Oury Jalloh&#39;s death! Disgusting rabble that wants to sell something like a memorial and funeral procession!
The violent left mob in Dessau&#39;s streets! Those who have had enough of these left-wing extremists will choose center-right in the future. #AfD #NoAntifa 🇩🇪 pic.twitter.com/1ChfVjalA8
"You&#39;d hurt yourself too much, believe it."
Here
We also whether the annual left show of violence.
We demonstrated against annual violent left-wing march and the worst abuse of the judiciary and police.
"As expected: On the &quot;memorial march&quot; on the anniversary of Oury Jalloh&#39;s death in Dessau, bottles, firecrackers and hatreds are hurled at the police and citizens by the left mob! AfD rally, however, was absolutely peaceful. #AfD #NoAntifa #NoMultiKulti"
How do you want to be able to judge intellectual wisp? 😂
Then the left are the greatest populists! They dramatize constantly and expect the outbreak of National Socialism every day and around every corner!
"No, I differentiate very well between left, left-wing populist and left-wing extremist or left-wing autonomy."
You have mixed up something! You feel sick ...
"No, in contrast to you, I differentiate very well between left-wing, populist and left-wing extremist or left-wing autonomous."
"No, in contrast to you, I differentiate very well between left-wing, populist and left-wing extremist or left-wing autonomous."
"Totally wrong! I very well differentiate between left-wing, populist and left-wing extremist or left-wing autonomous."
Because you want that? 😂 #NoAntifa #NoMultiKulti
"Please spare us with your razor and no, in contrast to you I differentiate very well between left, left populist and left extreme or left autonomous."
"&quot;Right-wing populist&quot; is not at all undemocratic, but a completely normal, approved direction that fully respects the FDGO. Those who cannot tolerate this are themselves undemocratic!"
"That also applies to the left side, right?"
Left-wing extremists were addressed and I stand by it!
"Someone says from the red swamp, yes?"
"You jumped, dear Communist!"
"Bankruptcy even if I have never been bankrupt or bankrupt? You silly guys really have no idea about business and finance! Left, right?"
"But you, yes? Never heard of Roten Garden u. heard in the Weimar Republic, right? Uninformed and simple-minded, but what others want to tell! Typical left today ..."
"Never heard of Roten Garden u. heard in the Weimar Republic, right? Uninformed and simple-minded, but what others want to tell! Typical left today ..."
Nice if it were satire!
"And clarify the next purge with your left-hand buddies using the Stalinist method and leave us alone, right? Your stupid left oil is annoying."
"Never heard of Roten Garden u. heard in the Weimar Republic, right? Uninformed and simple-minded, but what others want to tell! Typical left today ..."
With this comment you have just proven again that you are the bad left agitator!
Which &quot;racial madness&quot; please?
"I call people who call me Nazi or the like Stalinists, isn&#39;t that incredibly fair? Where do you see a problem?"
"Since we always speak out clearly against violence and extremism, we have no responsibility for it."
But you should very well leave it would be an asset to our country. 😉
"#Individual case No. ~ Meanwhile, unfortunately, normal condition. Part of the blame are left-wing border openers and good people. When will they finally take responsibility? They could voluntarily and selflessly play refugee victims !? #AfDwirkt #NoMultiKulti https://mobil.mz-web.de/dessau-rosslau/auf-kaufland-parkplatz-19-jaehrige-mit-messer-attackiert---taeter-fluechten-29915594?originalReferrer= https: // m.facebook.com/…"
Says a Stalin spinner !? 😄
"#Nafri, known as a dealer and petty criminal, runs amok and shoots in the south of France, #IS confesses. Typical message since the total opening of the border. When will Merkel &amp; Co. and left-wing station claps finally take responsibility for this? #AfD #NoMultiLulti #NoIslam"
Here
"# GroKo government declaration #Merkel (CDU): &quot;Germany, we are all&quot; #Dobrindt (CSU) &quot;Islam is not part of Germany&quot; It crackles in the entablature, that is long overdue! #AfDeffkt #NoIslam 🇩🇪"
"It&#39;s your turn first, isn&#39;t it?"
"So first he listens to me constantly, right? 😂"
Because I criticize violent left-wing extremism? 😄🤦🏼♂️
On the way to the video studio for @COMPACTMagazin. We need such alternative media in order to be able to get an unadulterated picture. #AfD #Compact
It&#39;s in your bedroom !? 😂
"So your comment is just the usual left-stupid rush, didn&#39;t you really get out of yourself? 🤔"
"I was neither bankrupt with my company nor was I thrown out anywhere, but you know your way around stupidity. Left stupid, yes? 🤔"
"No matter, thousands are interested. Do not infer yourself from others. 😉"
These are your parties. 😂
"Do you know, yes?"
