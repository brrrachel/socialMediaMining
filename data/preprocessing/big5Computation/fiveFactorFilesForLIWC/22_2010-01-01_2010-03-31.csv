Today I&#39;m late at #MSC. Gen.-Sec. Rasmussen on #NATO: Old dogs can learn new tricks.
"Albright recht scharf: Russia, the tail, should not wag the the dog here. #MSC"
"Ashton: ""I'm sorry to disappoint. I'm always sorry to disappoint."" #EP #Ashtonfail-"
Yang; China will never defend its interests at the expense of others. Who believes that? #MSC

"Hedegaard+Brundtland: stick to cap+trade, even if carbon tax would be better, because 1. we've been at it, 2. US business expects it. #BF10"
@df6ih ??
"Again ratio #SWIFT: 378 against, 196 for. #EP"
Frmr Mex. Pres. Zedillo: without a radical change of approach Cancun will fail. Sceptical about cap + trade. #BF10
Climate discussion at #BF10: Carbon accounting along consumption rather than production? Carbon tax instead of cap+trade?
Paula Dobriansky just dances around the issue of climate equity. She is a master of eloquently avoiding the tough issues. #BF10
"Dr. Kiang reminds us of US-CN deal on delivering 5 low carbon cities each. Why isn't EU doing such projects with CN, IN and others? #BF10"
How about G20 as climate policy forum instead of UN? Hedegaard: CN + IN don't want to discuss climate at G20. #BF10
"Dr. Kiang raises issue of climate equity and historical emissions. Moderator doesn't ask EU/US panelists, how they see that. Bad. #BF10"
This ends my reporting from #BF10. Hope to tweet again from BF11 next year. Enjoy Easter holidays!
This panel on climate change policy is the first on at #BF10 with a majority of women. Generally the gender balance would merit improvement.
At #BF10 Belgian FM wraps up. Great 5th Brussels Forum. Thanks 2 everybody. Was fun. (Indeed was.)
"Commissioner Hedegaard at #BF10 expects ""specific deliverables"" on climate change policy from the UN Conference in Cancun later this year."
moderator: Will G20 ebb away after crisis? Panel: G20 is there 2 stay. But jury is still out on effectiveness on financial stability. #BF10
"Could G20 evolve in2, maybe, a G12, with participants representing different global regions? Zedillo: OK, Mexico will represent NAFTA. #BF10"
Serbian Pres. Tadic : next week our parliament is going to pass resolution on war crimes in Srebrenica. We willnot destabilize Bosnia. #BF10
Zedillo: EU discussion about solving Greek crisis without IMF involvement was surrealistic. #BF10
"""There is an increasing number of global public goods."" If so, what does that entail for economic policy of co-operation? #BF10"
Zoellick+Bildt: crisis hat exposed megatrends. Asia will return to its role of 250 yrs. ago. #BF10
Pascal Lamy: Governance has 3 states like mass. National - solid. EU - liquid. International - gaseous. #BF10
Pascal Lamy: 8 Europeans (out of 24 participants in G20) doesn't make sense. Van Rompuy should make them at least speak with 1 mouth. #BF10
Will financial crisis be a Berlin Wall moment? Turningpoint? Wang: many uncertaincies. Sees gradual changes. There's no CN model yet. #BF10
"Zedillo: there's on overrepresentation of Europeans in WB, IMF and G20. But no use rushing now. US panelist (condescendingly) agrees. #BF10"
"G7 did do geopolitical issues, G20 does not. It's a steering group for int'l economic cooperation. #BF10"
Wang Jisi (Beijing): to balance some global imbalances China would like to invest abroad + import high tech.Finds political obstacles. #BF10
Zoellick: strategically for global economy the decisive issue will be managing debt. #BF10
every country wants to export its way out of the crisis. How would that work out? No answer. #BF10
Bildt bemoans fact that Greece crisis management prevented EU leaders from tackling long term issues enough (EU2020). #BF10
Point by Zoellick abt. developping countries viewing climatechangepolicy as conspiracy against their advance. What is our answer?. #BF10
"At #BF10 Zedillo: Stop pretending! If presidents attending G20, who represent 85% of global GDP, agree, they have power to do what it takes."
"Is there a danger of putting 2 much expectation on G20 as kind of ""magic""? Lamy: it's not THE organization, not even AN organization. #BF10"
"Mario Draghi's work being acclaimed at #BF10, I wonder whether anybody present would even know Axel Weber. #ECB"
"Pascal Lamy (WTO): G20 has been helpful in preventing serious protectionist development, but not in catalyzing necessary move forward. #BF10"
At #BF10 now last panel: G20 - the committee to save the world?
"Dr. Kiang: In China we say: ""Trap, don't hunt."" Westerners are doing too much hunting and too little trapping. #BF10"
Hedegaard: during EU council negotiations over EU2020 strategy 30% goal was out for several hours; now it's back in. #BF10
Brundtland: in some form or shape developping economies have 2 come on board; is optimistic over probability of change in CN on that. #BF10
"Who is really playing their part concerning climate? ""Yes we can"" doesn't mean ""Yes the government can"". #BF10"
In discussing global economic governance Zoellick mentions APEC creating a particular space for private sector participation. #BF10
Carl Bildt: West is going to be defined for quite some time by enormous debt. #BF10
At previous panel it took Mr. Larrabee from RAND to raise the issue of lack of public support for NATO. Albright: is the lowest in US! #BF10

Questions from US+RUS participants to 2 presidents: what are you going to do to help save Bosnia from downward spiral? #BF10

"""#ITER management structure is bad. Management has responsibilities without the necessary resources."""
Commercial #Fusion needs materials that can withstand much more neutron bombardment than ITER for a very long time. Do they ever exist? Open bet.
Fusion up to now (JET): 16 MW for 1 sec. With expenditure of 25 MW for the process. ITER target: 500 MW for 300 sec. With input 50 MW.
It would be very expensive to end #ITER. EU would have to compensate other 6 partners (US / CN / IN / KOR / JAP / RUS)! No exit clause!
"# ITER costs for the EU were estimated at 2.5 billion, now estimated at 6.5 billion. Building costs tripled alone."
"#ITER cost risks:""ranges of uncertainties start to decrease"". Commission still looking for funding of ""substantial"" cost increase."
"Industrial use of fusionpower not before 2050. But: ""Prepare EUindustries for future worldwide competition on fusion reactors."" Geht's noch?"
ITER will not perform material testing because there are too few neutrons. IFMIF should solve that until 2040. Then demo plans are needed.
Who do we owe ITER to? Gorbachev and Reagan 1985. In 10 years #ITER should be in #Cadarache. Fusion&#39;s future ain&#39;t what it used to be.

And herewith my twitter reporting of the Munich Security Conference ends. #MSC
"Holbrooke zu Kerstin Mueller (red lines): No. 1 issue is severing ties to Al Khaida, No. 2 How women are being treated. #MSC"
McCain: 20% of those released from Guantanamo go back into battle. To reconcilliation: you cannot put it ahead of success. #MSC
Kerstin Mueller: reconcilliation sounds good. But what about peace with Mullah Omar or with Hekmatjar? Where&#39;s red line #MSC
"Holbrooke: 3rd civil construction, especially agriculture; more money directly to AFG Reg. 4. Communication. 5. Reconciliation (incl. Taliban). #MSC"
Holbrooke: 1. Security / military. Offensive against the Taliban. 2. Police training (previously 85% of the illiterate police officers). #MSC
"Holbrooke: 2009 was a difficult year for AFG, 2010 will not be difficult, but 1 year of progress. #MSC"
Spanta: it takes strateg. Be patient with AFG. Don&#39;t just see the half-empty glass because there are problems. #MSC
"Spanta: Development in Kosovo has not been completed since 1999, although 25 times as much per capita was invested in the first few years as in AFG. #MSC"
"Stv. UK-Verteid.-Min.: 2010 entscheidendes Jahr in AFG. ""We have the plan. We have the resources."" Must step up communications. #MSC"
"Rasmussens 3 Ziele fuer kuenftige NATO: 1. territorial defense as transatlantic alliance (""first and foremost"") ... #MSC"
Claudia Roth zu AFG: How do you see the role of RUS in AFG? How do you see relationship between NGOs and military? #MSC
Question from UK: How can you better sell to citizens that war brings their own deaths? Rasmussen: Why question central. (Exactly!) #MSC
"Guttenberg: for dialogue about Medvedev&#39;s security policy proposals. After applause, above average. Outgoing applause. #MSC"
Guttenberg: new strateg. Link the concept of NATO and its institutional reform. #MSC
Guttenberg: Couldn&#39;t NATO&#39;s limitation to reaction be abandoned? For example in Africa. #MSC
Guttenberg: Successfully complete AFG mission together with the USA. Not all bad in AFG (vs. Kaesmann). #MSC
Guttenberg speaks to Global Zero from above and gives Westerwell&#39;s demand for the withdrawal. A-weapons a kick. #MSC
"Guttenberg wants consensus in NATO, but not necessarily unanimity. #MSC"
I add Rasmussen&#39;s extremely ambitious goals for #NATO. Now Guttenberg is talking about the NATO debate. Input phrases. #MSC
"Addendum to #MSC: The US delegation held press conference. In the first row 3 losers: Lieberman (&#39;00), Kerry (&#39;04), McCain (&#39;08)."
The fact is: disarmament panel suffocated somewhat in too much consensus. #MSC
Josef Joffe (ZEIT): on the podium only believers who rave about rebirth. What is missing: atheist. In other words: global zero = nonsense. #MSC
Ivanov: technically new nuclear reactors will no longer have any problems of proliferation in the future. #MSC
Steinmeier&#39;s clear message on nuclear disarmament: the direction must be right. Good idea! #MSC
Steinmeier insists on speaking English. (&quot;Goes faster.&quot;) I think: It is not always polite to speak English. #MSC
"Steinmeier: Here he can speak, unlike the SPD&#39;s Afghanistan Congress. #MSC"
Sen. Kerry: 1st vs. smaller A-arms. 2. US-RUS-CN must not track new uses. 3. Iran must not get A bomb. #MSC
Sen. Kerry (US): Reminds KelloggBriandPact of 1928 to abolish war. 61 states participated. Kellogg received the Nobel Peace Prize. #MSC
Narayanan: Nuclear Zero is possible. Gives list of possible steps towards that goal. #MSC
Narayanan (Governor West Bengal): India has always been against proliferation. Nuclear weapons + for the abolition of the WMD. (With a small detour ;-)) #MSC
"IAEA Director Amano: logically, nuclear disarmament must be combined with stronger control and verification. #MSC"
"Ivanov (RUS): Do I really believe in global Zero? Not in my life time. But we have to start, to allow grandchildren to experience that. #MSC"
Jones: takes up Clinton&#39;s Paris speech. #OSZE should also discuss #Medvedev ideas. #CFSP does not occur. #MSC
"J. Jones: tour d&#39;horizon, nothing analytical. Promotes SWIFT. (Does not report how the US is exerting pressure on EP.) #MSC"
"Jim Jones (US Nat&#39;l Secur. Adv.): Takes up criticism, USA neglected transatlantic. Partnership. Like Clinton in Paris in late January. #MSC"
"Lavrov (RUS) only talks about European. Safety. Big difference to the Chinese yesterday. There spoke world power, here regional power. #MSC"
Westerwelle wants Medvedev proposals for the European. Security &quot;discuss substantively&quot;. Lavrov is pushing this agenda. #MSC
Lavrov: #Georgia &quot;attacked another country&quot; in 2008. He means South Ossetia. I beg your pardon? &quot;Other country&quot;? #MSC
Lavrov (Foreign Min. RUS): complains of &quot;OSCE atrophy&quot;. The West had disregarded the principle of indivisible security in Europe. #MSC
"Westerwelle: &quot;Lisbon is not an end point, but a beginning.&quot; This is not how government works. #MSC"
Westerwelle&#39;s listing of global risks forgets poverty / hunger and the climate. And then he talks about visions. #MSC
"At the Munich Security Conference (#MSC), Ischinger welcomes the &quot;Elephant Round&quot;. With 8% elephant #Westerwelle. They mock behind me."
"Mottaki (indirect to Israel): If there were crimes in Europe of 60 years, should the Middle East pay the price? Ahmadinejad light! #MSC"
"Mottaki doesn&#39;t understand at all, so he pretends why someone is Iran. Find support for Hezbollah + Hamas problematic. #MSC"
Claudia Roth deals with mottaki election fraud and brutal violence and radical oppression press freedom. #MSC
Mottaki: Iran insists on nuclear enrichment. Bildt: why don&#39;t you interrupt enrichment in accordance with the UN Security Council demand? #MSC
"Mottaki: cynical about death sentences. &quot;Protest is OK, but crime is not.&quot; #MSC"
Mottaki: You can&#39;t make a mistake with the electoral system in Iran. (Did he mean the SO?) #MSC
I am convinced that Bildt is unable to ask Mottaki enough questions about the nuclear program. Mottaki ignores human rights. #MSC.
Bildt: clearly addresses human rights and death sentences (applause!). For nuclear weapons-free Middle East. #MSC
Mottaki: cannot be fixed on a more precise position. &quot;Political will is there.&quot; #MSC
Mottaki: Fuel exchange will work in the near future. we are at the limit of a basic agreement. #MSC
"Mottaki: Iran agrees to exchange fuel. Time, place, quantity still open. Both sides are serious. #MSC"
Mottaki: Abolish all nuclear weapons by an unknown date. Iran wants to implement NPT contract. Answered IAEA questions honestly. #MSC
Yang emphasizes EU&#39;s role as China&#39;s partner. EU should see CN more &quot;objectively&quot;. #MSC
"Yang gives CN perspective on security issues: North Korea, AFG, Iran, climate change (attacks Western development model). #MSC"
Yang: complains of heat in the room. &quot;We don&#39;t have that much energy in CN.&quot; #MSC
Yang: China takes on more and more international responsibility. Confident. #MSC
Yang: Chin. Strategy is: We need peace for our development and through it we also contribute to peace. #MSC
"Yang Jiechi speaks symbolically, English: &quot;I came to learn.&quot; #MSC"

@sven_kindler Agree. But Iran sits indirectly at every Middle East table. And ISR fear of Iran is real. #NOK
Perthes: Why does Europe not pay the annual billions flowing into the Middle East into a trust account? Parry until ISR / PAL. #NOK
Europe should consider removing incentives. Europ. Help allows ISR &quot;cheap crew&quot; + allows PAL to do little. #NOK
Perthes does not address the ISR fear of Iran. Iran wants to &quot;keep out&quot; of the Middle East conflict. Remarkable. #NOK

"Perthes: Europeans and Arabs. States have to negotiate play supporting role, USA active. #NOK"
Perthes: for power sharing between Fatah and Hamas. But do not give any guidelines for this. Doubt whether this is so ultra-pragmatic. #NOK
Perthes emphasizes more inner pole. Constraints that slowed Obama down as the mistakes in his actions. Shows a little where Perthes is. #NOK
Perthes: The most important change at the actor level took place in the USA. But Obama&#39;s 1st attempt got stuck. #NOK
Perthes: But is the path to dual citizenship still feasible? Not without outside help / pressure. #NOK
Perthes: Corresponding solution package is acceptable for majority at ISR + PAL. Bilingualism is generally accepted as a concept. #NOK
"Perthes: The contours of a durable solution are known. In the narrower ISR / PAL conflict, baselines correspond to Taba or Clinton parameters. #NOK"
"Perthes: is a mistake to deny the territorial nature of the conflict. (Yes, but: that&#39;s not all.) #NOK"
