"There is a mountain of excess CO2 certificates in Europe. Therefore, the EU agreed yesterday that these can be shut down. &amp;: Switch off particularly dirty coal-fired power plants + electricity from more climate-friendly sources = reduce CO2 emissions"
"2) The further expansion of e-mobility and the necessary networks, storage facilities and climate-friendly generation capacities are running in parallel. By the mid-2020s, electricity consumption will be max. are a few tetrahatt hours / year. So enough time for the expansion"
"1) Germany will remain a net exporter, wind and solar energy are not included in the video. Industry is already benefiting from the low electricity price for large companies thanks to #renewables"
"No! The demand for skilled workers for environmentally friendly power plants, lines and storage will grow. Opencast mines must be renovated and recultivated. We want to support that. And that works: In the former Central German area there is more employment today than before"
"Hooray! Again, no majority for #Glyphosat in the EU countries. Now it&#39;s time to phase out glyphosate! pic.twitter.com/ZVYsp0Pdee"
It is true that the demand for electricity increases as electromobility grows. But this need is met from the increase in green electricity. Would be stupid to charge electric cars with dirty coal electricity.

Prof. Schellnhuber: &quot;Why am I here? Because this party is apparently the only one who has the luxury of being guided by scientific truth.&quot; # bdk17
Now live at # BDK17 at http://www.gruene.de: Our guest speaker Professor Schellnhuber. Welcome!
&quot;The fact that we get coalitions of wishes will be the exception rather than the rule. We will therefore make more compromises to keep society together and not less.&quot; Winfried #Kretschmann at the # BDK17
&quot;We live in times when the question is: are we going to compromise or are we going to polarize? Don&#39;t we already have enough polarization in Europe and in the world?&quot; Winfried #Kretschmann at the # BDK17
"&quot;In these four years we want every bee, bird and butterfly to know, we will work for them.&quot; Katrin @GoeringEckardt at # BDK17"
&quot;Go where people are not yet convinced by GREEN. We will do that.&quot; Katrin @GoeringEckardt at # BDK17
"&quot;#Jamaika would have given the opportunity to say: ecology and economy, this is the chance for this country!&quot; Katrin @GoeringEckardt at # BDK17"
&quot;Christian Lindner was not about the little people. Not even about dismantling the solos. Christian Lindner was only about Christian Lindner.&quot; Katrin @GoeringEckardt at # BDK17
&quot;We would never have turned the coal phase out again and we will continue to fight for it in the next four years.&quot; Katrin @GoeringEckardt at # BDK17
Now live: Katrin @GoeringEckardt at # BDK17 http://www.gruene.de
&quot;We are the party that derives responsibility for the future from remembering.&quot; Claudia #Roth at the # BDK17
"&quot;Yes, we offered compromises that were anything but easy for us. We wanted to bend it in, but without bending.&quot; Claudia #Roth at the # BDK17"
"&quot;We are the last capable, progressive, left party to exist in this country.&quot; Toni #Hofreiter at the # BDK17"
&quot;It has shown how fundamentally different the democratic parties are and that is a good thing. Citizens have a large choice when they choose.&quot; Toni #Hofreiter at the # BDK17
&quot;We were convinced that we could have done something good for our country if the FDP hadn&#39;t panicked with responsibility.&quot; Toni Hofreiter at # BDK17
