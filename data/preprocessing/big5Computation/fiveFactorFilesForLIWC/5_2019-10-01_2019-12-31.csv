We still have to wait until the Bundestag Budget Committee calls us in to discuss our Section 21
"No, on the contrary, I - in my previous role - explicitly spoke out against a digital ministry. A properly organized digital cabinet is much more appropriate"
"Government submits bills and has to give me advice. The parliament passes laws and thus also creates the legal basis for data processing. If data processing contradicts German or European law, I come into play."
"We have been in #Bonn for 2,000 years, so we can also create 20,000 years of construction sites. Berlin was a deserted swamp 2,000 years ago"
I think that construction work in Bonn definitely takes much (!) Too long :-) pic.twitter.com/06IbMVhPn4
I guess so
Members = entitled to vote
Only clubs with at least three digits of members ü§£ @larsklingbeil
"No, although with this great club you should possibly write an exception in the law"
"BfDI not responsible for clubs, that is the LfDI. And of course we also do (!) More checks with it"
Please read the first sentence of the PM: &quot;... if ... use for your own purposes&quot;
We have published a notice on the website stating that we cannot be reached by email. You have subscribed to &quot;all publications&quot;
"Unfortunately, after the Noah Veil @winfriedveil decided that the Roman Empire did not need a paternalistic ark, it only had to be informed of the deluge and then freely decided whether it should build a boat"
I am an honorary professor for data ethics. But of course I will also go to other universities within my means
"In my lecture on data ethics at the Bonn / Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, I naturally only used sufficiently pseudonymized data pic.twitter.com/jowakU4omH"
This time I spoke more of the German government&#39;s resistance to clear anti-tracking regulations in the ePrivacy regulation üòâ
"Business models based on citizen tracking are NOT a digital innovation, but should be a no-go for digital policy. A free digital society needs the unobserved communication and information gathering"
They have been from the start
That was the reason for the tweet
Right. But I can think of more
"If the ePrivacy Regulation is now further delayed (very annoying), the Bundestag and the Federal Government would be well advised to correct the incorrect implementation of the ePrivacy Directive in Germany."
"That&#39;s why not ‚Äúown‚Äù, France, for example, relies on the open source system Matrix. I like it!"
"Don&#39;t misunderstand ‚Äúyour own‚Äù, it&#39;s about independence from commercial, proprietary messengers that are problematic from a data protection point of view. Was that sufficiently described now? :-) https://twitter.com/ovoss/status/1201783992422404096‚Ä¶"
The Berlin State Data Protection Officer must act ...
This wonderful restaurant (especially super brunch on Sundays) just voluntarily publishes it next to the front door

"Last meeting of the European Data Protection Board for 2019 in Brussels. Above all, we give our working groups detailed work orders for important fundamental questions and interpretations of the GDPR. BfDI and LfDIs will support the work as rapporteurs"
The first sentence and this are to be read in context
"This is not a literal quotation and in the detail I expressed myself a little differently, not only about Ireland. But yes, on the whole, correctly presented"
What news do you expect?

That is why the first sentence begins with the word &quot;If ...&quot;
"As an addition (!) To the protection rules of the GDPR, this would be an overdue and important further development in data protection, especially with regard to government services and registers."
"Please ask more specifically, do not manage to read the newsletter first"
Many thanks to the Budget Committee: Bundestag strengthens data protection supervisory authority https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Pressemitteilungen/2019/28_BTst%C3%A4rktDatenschutzaufsichtbeh%C3%B6rde.html‚Ä¶
He officially says something about it on Monday. Had just waited for the Committee on Budgets to speak out
"What other legal basis should there be for the transfer of personal health data to third parties not involved in treatment / insurance / billing? That is the context! Otherwise relapse into the 60s, before BDSG"
My job under the BDSG is also to raise public awareness
So our duty is done. It goes to bed. The hard-working MPs will announce results in the Budget Committee when they are ready
There are still some contradictions
"Next year, the national implementation of the European Electronic Communication Code will result in another change in responsibilities"
"The data protection authorities of the federal states are responsible for the practices and homepages of private companies. Nevertheless, I still have a lot of construction sites, some of which we create ourselves with our own ideas to improve"
"If I can&#39;t do it from the hip, I didn&#39;t look at the history, but found it that way. Does any of the old warhorses in the timeline know?"
Never felt annoyed üòè
"Yes, we are involved in consultancy on register modernization. The DSK has taken a decision on the subject https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/en/20190912_entschliessung_zur_digitalisierung_der_verwaltung.pdf‚Ä¶"
"I think @EskenSaskia is talking about the research database and you about the medical data that the health insurance company should use to check whether a health app can be prescribed. Both are not without problems, but different questions"
"No, why should it be? Growing up at the BfDI is mainly due to growing up with federal security authorities, eHealth with the positions I oversee, advice on telecommunications and postal services, as well as participation in international committees. No substitute for LfDIs"
"That&#39;s why I talked about facts. However, I should also speak of the legal situation, because that would logically mean my opinion"
"Thanks for the hint. We investigate this and, of course, if necessary, as necessary, turn the Pronlem off at short notice"
I know what you&#39;re alluding to: Are DSB pushing for remedial measures under Art. 58 GDPR so as not to end up in court? Not in my opinion and I also think that it will become increasingly visible soon
"I only answer for BfDI: In the previous notices (note the timing) for the positions to be supervised by me, there was still no case"
At least here I don&#39;t understand the criticism. The DSB make it clear what they think is wrong and will also apply it to controls and complaints. And the facts are clear enough to remedy the misconduct even without expensive consultants
In the circulation folder is &quot;establish&quot;
"We raise awareness, we don&#39;t &quot;scare&quot;"
Personal web tracking only with consent https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SiteGlobals/Modules/Buehne/DE/Startseite/Pressemitteilung_Link/HP_Text_Pressemitteilung.html‚Ä¶
"Dortmund have scored 1, 1, 0, 0 and 0 goals. This is a clear indication of an &quot;exhausting&quot; function, the results of which are now permanently 0. A bad trend, my sympathy is with you"
"Bayern have scored 5, 4, 6, 5 and 4 goals. All this speaks for a function (unscientificly referred to as a ‚Äútrend‚Äù, the results of which fluctuate by the natural number 5). The most likely next result is 6 goals"
I had also referred to these cases
The decisive trend in the results can only be seen - obviously for every neutral and mathematically trained observer - from separate functions for the number of goals for Bayern and Dortmund. The basis is the last five (!) Games
How do you know that the observed events are part of a linear function? Typical novice mistake in classifying observed results. The 4: 0 could also be the turning point of the function :-)
 https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Transparenz/Stellungnahmen/2019/StgN_Digitale_Versorgung_Gesetz¬†‚Ä¶
"No. Firstly, more intensively and secondly, there have also been adjustments in some areas"
"Yes, this request was included in an amendment and resolved"
That would also be prohibited under the current law
Exactly. That&#39;s why &quot;why not&quot;
Was already in the works
"This statement on the draft for the Digital Supply Act https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Transparenz/Stellungnahm/2019/StgN_Digitale_Versorgung_Gesetz‚Ä¶ concerns the version that was brought into the Bundestag. Of course, there was also advice for the government beforehand"
"I don&#39;t think she intended, but she could be misunderstood"
"This is not a &quot;fight&quot;, nor a dispute, just clarification of the different roles"
"Has nothing to do with digital, but with time. There are people who actually have to stay focused on every point at a conference and don&#39;t do anything else in parallel. And even go to sleep in the evening ü§®"
"In the area of pseudonymization, there have been improvements at the last second, other things now depend on the accompanying ordinance, others have been neglected unnecessarily"
Our opinion should actually be on the website. I&#39;ve only been traveling since Tuesday and can&#39;t see whether and if not why not yet
I am NOT the supervisor for the state data protection officer. These are independent and independent authorities
"So that no misunderstanding arises: When Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn says that the digital supply law has been discussed with me, it does NOT mean that he has accepted all important demands or that I have withdrawn my concerns."
"I also did not comment on the general decision, I only disagreed with your argument"
"Even if this should be the case, &quot;not being able to delete&quot; means that this data will not be deleted even after 6 years"
"It is doubtful whether this can be justified for all data. And if you cannot delete, then you cannot delete, not even after the period in which you may have needed the data"
"For example, are the bank statements of tenants data that the landlord is obliged to keep. Or shouldn&#39;t he have deleted them immediately according to their purpose? That&#39;s what it was about between us ..."
"&quot;... extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social and health insurance data as well as bank statements.&quot;"
"&quot;... will not serve the purpose of their original collection. It was data on the personal and financial situation of the tenants, such as B. Salary certificates, self-disclosure forms, ... &quot;"
"‚ÄúPersonal data of tenants was saved without checking whether storage is permitted or even necessary. In peer-reviewed individual cases, private information from affected tenants, some of which was some years old, could therefore be ... &quot;"
"Apparently, the company did not even make this assessment, but probably stored a lot of data that cannot be deleted for which there are no retention periods (!)"
"If you criticize the &quot;You must be able to delete&quot; setting, this is a derivative of it. So neither source PM nor anything else"
The very simple statement hits the nail on the head. It is obvious that the attitude of simply storing everything you have ever experienced and requested about tenants and prospective tenants cannot be correct
Not on the agenda this time. But even so 36 agenda items
"Thank you. In addition to the fact that because of the bus failures, the employees of my authority also need more time to get to work ü§£"
"We have made recommendations to BMG and will issue a statement to the Bundestag, which will then be public. Spoiler: We have concerns!"
"Hello @Apple, are you serious? Would you like to arrange telephone support, be called by you and then be put on hold forever? For the second time? On the date you suggested?"

"In the supervisory board of the traffic area until 2004 in my memory. At that time, we expanded our public transport offer and also did not collect any compulsory dividends from municipal utilities that can only be achieved through job cuts"
I made politics myself and know that some things are difficult. But how often the buses in #Bonn for my children (and me) fail is gradually becoming completely unacceptable. And this silence from the top of the city is also annoying. Public transport broke #AusGruenden

Assessment of the 41st International Data Protection Conference ‚Äùhttps://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Pressemitteilungen/2019/25_41_IDSK.html‚Ä¶
"Ok, because we also receive and send encrypted emails"
"If the letter contained a legal notice, it cannot be sent by email"
"a) CDU / CSU is a fraction and therefore outside the supervision of the data protection authorities. However, I have repeatedly proposed to the Bundestag to set up a data order b) My Berlin colleague is responsible for the CDU (Berlin headquarters) and the Bavarian authority for the CSU"
"Discussion round, no slides or similar Possibly video on website # ICDPPC2019"
"Is this the new popular sport in Germany? Someone makes a differentiated proposal and the other side does not make a counter-proposal, but immediately uses manslaughter phrase &quot;No general suspicion&quot;? Honestly @Bitkom, did you read the suggestion at all?"
"The instruments are there, at least in the EU. The cooperation between the authorities to enforce them is still difficult."
"The #ICDPPC work program includes more permanent working groups on global enforcement, AI and the protection of minors. Subsequently, a study on the connection between data protection and democratic decision-making in the face of microtrageting &amp; Co. is presented"
"This morning debate with Prof. Cannataci, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy. Great agreement and emphasis on warning governments and parliaments to back doors and weakening encryption # ICDPPC2019"
"The # ICDPPC2019, i.e. the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, has given itself a new name: Global Privacy Assembly. Easier to remember, but unchanged the place of exchange of independent regulators"
Always this evaluation of outward appearances
"I would never call myself a Stalinist, especially not because I am a member of a party that suffered from Stalinism. It was an ironic reaction to those who disparage me for being a Stalinist for data protection"
"So far, exchange of experience about regulatory work, debate about requirements for AI, further development of cooperation among each other also between conferences #icdppc"
Some more information please ...
Please report to your Saxon colleague

A completely different question is related to the occasion
What do you mean exactly?
Data protection does not stand in the way of naming companies that have violated the law
Even after a conviction ...
"That&#39;s exactly what I suggested, but by the way, France does not take off the shelf, but develops on the basis"
Thank you for the exchange of ideas and opinions between two officers who have a little to do with digital development :-) https://twitter.com/tj_tweets/status/1184486417327636481‚Ä¶
"Data protection shouldn&#39;t take criminals into account, I read. My answer: First, criminals (and their families) do not lose their fundamental rights. Secondly, this does not justify extensive surveillance of widely suspected (!) Or (!) All citizens"
"Then you have to ask the responsible Berlin representative. If the password is entered, the date is not re-collected, but compared with the inventory"
"First, I run an independent authority and am not an SPD representative. Second, I speak about the protection of personal data and not about the integrity of any digital process. I&#39;m not Federal Digital Representative :-)"
"Yes, false suspicion, which is in fact completely unfounded"
"Bureaucratic German sure (that I usually always try to avoid), but directly in competition with real verbs? oh well!"

I think the European Data Protection Supervisor will comment on this
No European data protection authority can make decisions in cross-border cases without the consent of the other authorities. Not even if she doesn&#39;t want to draw any consequences
"The responsible data protection authority, in this case probably Ireland, will propose the consequences and clarify this with the European Data Protection Board. I cannot estimate a concrete consequence from a media report without an investigation. But not the first case of this kind"
Executive and adviser to government / parliament
"And the heading is NOT meant sarcastic, which results from the article"
Did you read the article?
Because that&#39;s not the alternative at all. PIMS and prohibition of tracking is the goal
I do not understand your contribution now ... what is the content position?
"‚ÄúThank you CJEU that you make surfing more strenuous!‚Äù Https://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/eugh-cookies-webtracking-kommentar-nutzer-1.4624874‚Ä¶ checked again, of the article I can sign every paragraph, exactly so it is pic.twitter.com/VBTYlOgE3Z"
"Behind the cookies there is a profile, since user has no influence"
"Deleting cookies is good, but it only reduces the problem: during a session there would be spies, profiles would be created"
The judgment also indirectly covers this
"With ePrivacy, an obligation could be introduced that the browser has default settings and I am only asked if the website wants more. And then just say &quot;no&quot; and let the competition work"
"An assessment, but it is not my job to publicly comment on party decisions. I would rather look for a direct conversation"

"No fines yes, usually no sanctions. And this is about legislation"
I can of course switch to official German üôÉ
"However, according to my taste, we are too late with the public statements, depending on the legislative procedure (eg in the case of shortening the deadline) for the public debate"
We are currently adapting the future handling of confidential advice and public statements to today&#39;s needs. Confidential advice is important to us and achieves or can achieve a lot for data protection.
Waaaaaas? üò¢
"We were involved by the BMG, they just didn&#39;t listen to all the advice"
Publish government documents ?: More transparency would be good for democracy.

"444 votes, not just one party"
"Art. 14 BDSG, including &quot;to advise the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the federal government and other institutions and bodies on legislative and administrative measures to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data&quot;"
How did you come up with this idea?
"And you believe that if you had to give your consent to tracking regardless of the use of the service, everyone would agree (!)?"
A well-known counterexample: Consent to FB / WhatsApp to evaluate the contacts violates the rights of third parties
For example
"Not at all, for example there was already a debate when evaluating email, speech-to-text, video storage in the cloud ..."
"Not at all, for example there was already a debate when evaluating email, speech-to-text, video storage in the cloud ..."
"For example, certain forms of tracking, which also allow statements about third parties, can remain illegal even with your consent"
