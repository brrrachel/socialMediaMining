@OlafWedekind PM from me and my KV @GrueneTS on the judgment of the #DresdnerBahn. https://www.renate-kuenast.de/berlin/unterwegs/dresdner-bahn-urteil/…

Who still has beautiful photos of weddings that we staged a long time ago at the #Motzstrassenfest etc? # Marriageforall #followerpower
And I would like to say that it was unfortunately very easy.
Clarity: I sent TO of the Legal Affairs Committee last week. The fact that there were 3 laws # Marriage for Everyone was not due to the SPD. @gruene
Not all conventional farmers see it that way. I&#39;m confident about that. More and more want a future for their families.
25 years!
Will there be another storm?
Our wonderful @BriHasselmann has been mobilizing since yesterday
"Yes, is on the committee. Amendment since 5:15 p.m. Must be on homepage Bt."
We stand on the side of the victims. #Colonia Dignidad needs reappraisal and victims need help.
Especially since there was no bang in the Bundestag. That was already there
But today all no
Origin Rhld plant
oops
That reminds me that the great unicorn chocolate is still in the drawer. Mmmmh.
First take all hurdles. GO and stuff. Tomorrow 9 a.m.
But the hardworking MdB from NRW were of course still in the @GrueneBundestag
Yes
But that still takes 3 years
"I&#39;m finally coming now too ,,"
Oh.
All respect for that.
I demonstrated with other marriages over 20 years ago at the #Motzstrassenfest. Where&#39;s the hurry ...
Here you go! And I was really excited from before!

Unanimous decision in the Bundestag to process #ColoniaDignidad. That is good and I will stay tuned.

"Wrong, you have to arrange it. The #SPD hadn&#39;t done that."
