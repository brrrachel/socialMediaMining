"It is also conceivable that there was no intention to kill. It is conceivable that he acted in self-defense. It is conceivable ... I would suggest an explanation in such a case, which cries for treachery as rarely a case, and especially in such a disgusting case of a child murder."

"They carry owls to Athens. The AfD is unsuitable. Already because of their left-wing twist in economic policy, but also because of massive personnel problems."
"Quite right, that&#39;s how many voters seem to see it. The same applies to the rest of the opposition."
I would like to admit that it is possible to think otherwise; as almost always. But dealing with the case is negligent! It would be completely unthinkable that the StA would act at this level in the case of Halle&#39;s gunman; cope.
Anyone who talks about expropriation has never been interested in discourse.

Incapacity concerns the act as a whole and not its classification according to murder / homicide. Or do you have another opinion?
A common misconception that StAe do not have to look for anything exonerating. They have to! Only case law and literature come to a predominant conclusion here: treachery -&gt; murder
I only read the accusation of &quot;being close to the state&quot;.

"I am actually concerned with the rule of law, its laws and the associated case law."
"Not Stalinism but satire. Not a bad one, by the way."
"That alone would not be a problem, he even has to. The StA has to look for and evaluate relief. The problem is deeper here. Someone doesn&#39;t know the legal situation and case law."
"In this case, both relevant views come to the same result: treachery"
"Yes, we had canceled the project in Saxony."
"If the MDR had justified it, yes then ... But it has expressly not done so. There they were only insulted by the accusation of being close to the state. The existence of ‚Äúreal‚Äù reasons, which have apparently been ignored, makes it rather worse for the MDR."

Not even then. The legal tender is not contractually required.
"I make fun of someone who is obviously doing the opposite of what he is promoting. As a lawyer for the climate, the man is &quot;lousy&quot;."
I&#39;m just afraid of the damage on the way there.
You are not a good person. üòâ
"Ah sorry, then I misunderstood you. The offer is of course permissible."
"The host can only avoid this if he demands advance payment. Then he can kick out cash payers. If you can prove a system in this regard, it is legally enforceable under competition law."
"So I let myself be served in full knowledge, wait for the waiter and offer cash. The problem now is the restaurant, not me."
The exclusion of the cash payment option is ineffective.
"And if you do go there: Up to 50 coins must be accepted, regardless of the denomination."
"I&#39;m afraid that he will change his business model for the third guest. Don&#39;t go there. After all, we are talking about a lawbreaker! üòâ"
"No, he is in default of acceptance if he does not take the cash."
The agreement of a different payment obligation opens the possibility to pay differently. The option to pay with the legal tender does not exclude them. You can&#39;t rule that out.
Socialism is only sexy when every conceivable group of society is presented with its own disadvantage in the most dazzling colors. It benefits the backroom communists or the want-to-be future profiteers of real existing socialism.
"No, there are insidious things. If there is a different situation in exceptional cases, a few sentences would be appropriate. StAen do this in other proceedings where it also appears politically opportune."
"In Berlin there are also well-attended drug stands, assigned by the regulatory office. But it is against German law."

Well ... It depends a lot on the state and the choice. But nothing would convince me at the moment.
"It just cannot be the yardstick, otherwise we would not dissolve the party."

They do what exactly?

You obviously didn&#39;t understand my tweet.

"No, not that. But you can be right without success, unless you assume that the Greens and above all Merkel are right with everything."
"My departure shows that I knew her. In addition, the stagnation for three years shows that my analysis from 2015 was correct. There were only two ways."
Right! The AfD ultimately prevents this.

"You can discuss that, but you can&#39;t call it market."
"You can do that, but it&#39;s not a market. I am confused by a confused liberal party."
"After all, gradually."
Because state-regulated and created constraints are not a market but socialism in different degrees of severity.
"I know exactly that it was, but I will correct it anyway. üòÇ"
The FDP also considers CO2 certificate trading to be a MARKET economy.
That can&#39;t be all. Something has to be there.
Both consider ‚Äútheir‚Äù measures to be sensible.

The establishment of a competition association would probably be helpful because it would take away the exclusive sovereignty of interpretation in the public discourse.
"Then you no longer need laws. If I threaten to shoot someone because they collect taxes from me, you can prevent them by de-escalation. So I don&#39;t pay taxes."
"Protesters almost did. And yes, according to all reports, the use of firearms was occasionally possible."

I consider violence against police officers to be completely outside of any discussion.

Civil disobedience? I asked about murderers!
"Those who do not shy away from this must never give in to the rule of law, otherwise the state will die!"
Are you talking about violent criminals who are not afraid to injure or kill police officers at the border?
"Nope, it was also counterproductive. She went to Stuttgart. Gedeon was outside four hours later! Meuthen then split the faction. Because for Meuthen and the faction it was never about Gedeon. It was theater on both sides. Back then it was about the group chairmanship."
Then you were missing. üòâ
And then my wife and I were in Israel. Then there was something going on again.
"Frequently repeated until today. It was only Frauke who removed Gedeon from the faction, not Meuthen. https://twitter.com/mucknelda/status/1182215488325242880‚Ä¶"

"Ok, you have to see small progress."
Really? One of us was missing in logic.
You even write an entire book.
"The best life insurance for Jews seems to be the stupidity of the anti-Semites. From this perspective, the pitiful shape of Halle is almost ideal."
"That would be a comprehensible sentence from every citizen in this country. However, I expect a member of the government to take action or take responsibility at some point after the No. XXX attack. https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1182174593068478464‚Ä¶"
And does the state do it all?
At least the synagogue&#39;s security measures have held up. The bloodbath would be many times worse. #Hall
"Mind game: The Identity Movement occupies the Great Star in Berlin. What is the police doing? What do the media write? And no, I&#39;m not a supporter of the IB. I just reject HE the same way."
I have already criticized within the AfD. So this is not new.
"If it did, it would be the continuation of US foreign policy over the past decades. But that&#39;s exactly what you should wait for. That is not certain."

"As long as some insult me as an AfDler and the AfD in return as Merkel lackeys, everything is going in an orderly fashion."
I&#39;m worried. The Hallam said there will be deaths. Not that someone chokes on the chamomile tea bag.
Cold tea? Doesn&#39;t that violate the Geneva Convention?
A Syrian pulls a truck driver out of his truck and rams dozens of cars. I see several possible options (and a realistic one). And all possibilities suggest that Syrians be returned to their home country from Germany as soon as possible.

"Only if Kalbitz takes his place, which would not be a major improvement."
"Humps or green. The fatal logic of the AfD. Incidentally, emigration is always possible and with these two options there would be no alternative."

I say: current
"Yes, that&#39;s why you can also leave the nonsense. However, the AfD is by far the crowning glory."
