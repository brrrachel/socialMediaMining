It is now clear what outstanding humanitarian achievement #Bavaria is achieving. #Refugees
Prime Minister Albig and his red-green friends have to stop their nine-times-good advice about good people at #Bavaria.
"Ironically, the red-green governed Schleswig-Holstein imposes a freeze on # refugees and thus shows the mendacity of the debate."
Strengthen before Facebook Q&amp;A! #fragCSU https://t.co/L6T4AR23jM
"Before the Facebook Q&amp;A, an editorial visit to the Huffingtonpost! Cool team! https://t.co/APQIicNaSr"
RT @CSU: We wish you a nice Christmas evening! God bless all those who work on the holidays and do for others! https://t.co/...
"#LITC in Nuremberg! Good mood, full house, is fun! https://t.co/22n5N7B9Yq"
"With the policy of open external borders, the Greens risk Europe&#39;s failure."
"Stegner shouldn&#39;t worry about @CSU, but rather about the 25 percent SPD."
#CSU has persistently represented Bavarian interests. Use pays off: #Billionaires have been surpassed. # Financial equalization
"With approval of the reorganization, the red-green countries have finally admitted that the # state financial equalization is unfair."
There is no alternative to the leading German culture - multi-culture has failed! My contribution in the Cicero: https://t.co/SFiZB7EWrf
The #CSU is the participation party. Thank you for a great party congress! # CSUPT15 https://t.co/Du52RoGGJs
The chairman speaks! # CSUPT15 https://t.co/QnAVxIuP5K
Generations meet: Thuy Tran and Walter Thum. Representing all members: Thank you for your commitment! https://t.co/1xvAN6UIpJ
"CSU builds future! We have further developed the party in organization, communication and content. # CSUPT15 https://t.co/opqca80YsY"
RT @CSU: Germany needs the strong #Bavaria! At # CSUPT15 we are setting the course for a successful future! https://t.co/eNzxQ...
Now an interview in the ARD morning magazine for the CSU party conference. # CSUPT15 https://t.co/CREwHe24Yp
RT @CSU:. @ Andischeuer: The # CSUPT15 will make it clear: Germany needs strong Bavaria! https://t.co/d2lOrbUJ8y
It cannot go on like this: We urgently need to limit the flow of refugees.
"We do not need a language discussion, but a solution to the refugee crisis! # Schäuble #Lavine"
# Schäuble expresses in pictorial language what many people in Germany feel. #Avalanche
One thing is clear: we have to suspend the #family reunification!
Unlimited #family reunification means worrying overwhelming Germany!
"With unlimited #family reunification, the refugee million this year would have to be multiplied by a factor of 4."
"With Fahimi&#39;s utterly unrealistic statements, it is no wonder that Gabriel can do without them well. #Familiennachzug"
Everything else means: again the current refugee numbers times 3 or even 4. That would further overwhelm Germany!
The necessary measures to limit the flow of refugees also include the suspension of family reunification. #Refugees
"Finally, yes, finally the SPD has moved. The decisions must now be implemented quickly and consistently."
"Special reception centers with a stricter residence obligation, benefit restrictions and suspension of family reunification are necessary."
"Tightening, acceleration, control and limitation! The CSU has demanded and implemented a fast asylum package 2."
Germany now needs a strong foreign policy. I asked for that in a guest post in the FAZ. https://t.co/qYCnubl2AD
There are no peace plans for Syria and Libya - and a firm stance towards Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
"Europe&#39;s borders are chaotic, the EU is fighting and millions of migrants are overrun on the continent."
"#Fahimi should stay in her fairytale world, we take responsibility for the country! # Refugees #Bavaria #Transit zones"
It is irresponsible on the part of the #SPD to hide reality. #Refugees
"RT @CSU: #Bayern bears the main burden of the refugee flow. We need a limit, otherwise the population living here will be overloaded!"
"We know what crowds are on the way to the German border, and reality must finally arrive in Berlin! #Refugees"
The only thing we don&#39;t have in this chaotic situation is time and patience. #Refugees
Emergency situations require quick decisions and decisive action. #Refugees
Allegation that # transit zones are prisons is absurd. Nobody is brought to #Germany against the will and detained. #Refugees
"#Fahimi does not know the effects of the immense influx of refugees in the municipalities, especially in #Bavaria."
In an interview with @HuffPostDE renewed the demand for an immediate upper limit for refugees. https://t.co/OdKAT2qsMg
Done! My second Facebook Q&amp;A was also extremely exciting. Looking forward to the next time. #fragCSU https://t.co/5qSAS806Vd
Looking forward to my second Facebook Q&amp;A. Tomorrow 5:30 p.m. on the @ CSU-FB page. #fragCSU
Very well! Green Palmer in refugee policy entirely on the # CSU line. What does @GoeringEckardt actually say? https://t.co/fWnqHqVAwT
A signal must emanate from this # DLT15: we must immediately launch a second asylum package!
Bavaria was laughed at when we said we need fast return centers. Now we have it! # dlt15
Horst Seehofer fights to find a better way together in terms of content! There is still a lot to do! #DLT 15. @ Junge_union
"RT @Junge_Union: &quot;but: we need an upper limit. And we have already exceeded this limit,&quot; said Andreas #Scheuer on the # D…"
"RT @Junge_Union: Andreas #Scheuer: &quot;270,000 refugees were accepted in Bavaria. That is Christian responsibility!&quot; # DLT15"
Today in Hamburg: JU Germany Day with my JU Bavaria. Looking forward to my speech! # dlt15 http://t.co/dMvbEXjquT
The unsoundly hypocrisy of the Greens shows that the Greens are irresponsible and unable to govern.
"Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate take in much fewer # refugees than they should, while Bavaria bears the brunt."
"The behavior of the Greens, who call for solidarity in Sunday speeches but do not practice in everyday life, is embarrassing and humanitarian disappointing."
The Greens clandestinely agreed today to the long overdue measures that they massively fought weeks ago
The Greens&#39; asylum course has crashed!
Time is running out! Further necessary steps such as the establishment of transit zones must follow.
The #Asylum Package decided in the Federal Council is a first important intermediate step in order to restore order in the refugee crisis.
#Bavaria is acting! https://t.co/3qxiiDruAY
"If the red-green countries do not finally assume their responsibility in the refugee crisis, we will make them do it!"
Many thousands of refugees are not accepted here from #Bavaria
Ms. #Fahimi should rather help that red and green governed countries do not say goodbye entirely out of solidarity.
Ms. #Fahimi shows how far the #SPD is from the drama of the real local situation.
"RT @CSU: Today we celebrate the #German unit. Our country has grown together, we can be proud of that. http://t.co/vHggHY4N14"
We finally need to talk about an upper limit for refugees!
"It must be made clear that immigration is stopped. Here, above all, we see a duty on the European level."
"We are humanitarian and solidary, but we are over the limit."
The asylum package brought in today is an important and overdue intermediate step.
