"Pictures beautiful - hair beautiful - no action. With Mrs von der Leyen, the others are always responsible - never the minister herself."
Does Chancellor Altmaier write only on the CDU election program or does he also take care of the MAD and the unspeakable von der Leyen scandal?

SPD wants to put a stop to tax criminals - also with tax CDs. Union always against it. Swiss agent spies on German tax investigators.
"Now it&#39;s about fighting for every voice. If you want Torsten Albig to remain prime minister, you have to vote for the SPD. # Coastal Coalition"
"Today with Martin Schulz and Torsten Albig stations in Husum, Flensburg, Kiel - finally with the Schulzzug to L√ºbeck. #SPD #WirMachenDas"

"Bankruptcies, bad luck + breakdowns (1) de Maizi√®re: weak words - no action. Bankruptcies, bad luck + breakdowns (2) von der Leyen: Strong words-guilt are the others."
Betting that after this fiasco there would have been long calls for resignation from the Union would be de Maiziere and von der Leyen social democrats?
Today journal with report about from the Leyens PR Show and de Maizi√®res interview from Washington leaves only stunned üëé
Right-wing extremist officer as a terrorist suspect at the Maizieres Federal Office and the man talks about German culture - great!
What still has to happen in the Bundeswehr? Response: Minister of Defense&#39;s PR show and forward defense on her own behalf
Von der Leyen is responsible for the extreme right-wing activities of the Bundeswehr and &quot;full confidence of the Chancellor&quot;. Time to say goodbye.

"Despite anger over one-sidedness in election reporting, the following applies on the day of press freedom: No to &quot;lying press&quot; propaganda from the right!"

Tax CDs for convicting tax criminals are correct and fair. Spying on tax investigators is a scandal!
"Defense Minister from 2005: FranzJosef Jung, Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg, Thomas de Maiziere, Ursula von der Leyen (all CDU / CSU)"
It can be shown! https://twitter.com/harald4tweet/status/859439386886369280 ...

"It is fair to convict tax criminals and punish them harshly. Instead, the Swiss agent spies on German tax investigators."
CDU had violently criticized Walter-Borjans + SPD for tax CD purchases. Now Swiss tax investigators are spying on. You notice what?

"Shaking Head II: Von der Leyen criticizes the Bundeswehr leadership culture. The minister is responsible for bankruptcies, breakdowns and right-wing activities"
Shake your head l: De Maiziere chats in the Gauland sound about German lead culture to score right - our lead culture is the Basic Law!

Nice format: Be sure to watch the two programs of the NDR SH magazine with Torsten Albig and the opposition leader! It&#39;s worth comparing!
"In a direct comparison with the SH Magazin of the NDR, Prime Minister Albig was far superior to the opposition leader. #We will do it"
&quot;Dissidents&quot;? What on earth does the agitation of democratic enemies have to do with thinking?
The opposition leader can afford to make false claims since he does not have to do anything. Credibility is different. #We will do it
Reliability + honesty with Torsten Albig in the SH magazine of the NDR instead of saying the same thing as with the opposition leader. #We will do it
Yesterday in the SH magazine of the NDR an opposition leader who promises everything. Today a prime minister who keeps his word. #We will do it
Sovereign Prime Minister Torsten Albig in SH magazine of NDR. Promised contents! #We will do it

"SPD stands with no ifs and buts to EU, NATO, UN - our international alliance commitments. But NATO as part of de Maiziere&#39;s &quot;lead culture&quot;?"
"Bankruptcy, bad luck and glitches. Scandals in the Bundeswehr. Responsible for CDU ministers: zu Guttenberg, de Maizi√®re and von der Leyen."
And it wasn&#39;t de Maiziere&#39;s messy primitive culture debate that is only due to the competition with Scheuer and Gauland. https://twitter.com/spdde/status/858703859975430144‚Ä¶

Coalition issue again a clear point for sovereign MP Albig. #WeMakeThe #voting arena
Nobody has done so much for the police as a coastal coalition. Opposition leaders prefer snatching than tackling. #WeMakeThe #optionarena
Affordable housing: only demands - no ideas from the opposition leader. CDU always votes against apartment buildings. #WeMakeThe #voting arena
Even with obstetrics nothing concrete from the opposition leader - factual answer from the Prime Minister. # Election arena #We&#39;m doing this
Confused topic hopping without structure. Sovereign Prime Minister - hectic opposition leader. Good job #WeMakeThe #voting arena
Opposition leaders are constantly attacking without facts. Everything promises -nothing. Coastal Coalition Improvements #WirMakingThe #Voting Arena
Sloppy planning by CDU traffic ministers complicates road construction. Opposition leader: No idea-no concept. We build street # Wahlarena
"One would have, one should ... so the opposition leader to HSH Nordbank - Torsten Albig is more specific. #wahlarena"
The course of the debate makes it increasingly clear who is and remains the prime minister and who is the leader of the opposition. #WeMakeThe #optionarena
"Again post-fact nonsense on the subject of infrastructure by opposition leaders. MP: &quot;He makes the posters, I build streets&quot; # electoral arena"
Opposition leader promises everyone everything according to the motto 2x2 = 5. Promised-kept only at the SPD #WirMachenDas #Wahlarena
Torsten Krael&#39;s comment in the WELT on the AFD party congress is largely like an eloge. Herzinger&#39;s comment on Venezuela fits this.
Aid for families is what opposition leaders call &quot;election gifts&quot; and wants to take that away from them. Relieve families. #WeMakeThe #optionarena
Sovereign Prime Minister meets aggressive and post-factual opposition leader at #NDR election arena
CDU was responsible for clear cutting at teaching positions and opposition leaders are now spitting out big notes. #NDRWahlarena
No system debates. School peace. # Election arena #We&#39;m doing this
Opposition leaders want to eliminate freedom of choice in schools again and give up school peace. We ensure good school! #Wahlarena
"Also at daycare, the opposition leader at the # electoral arena is lying"
NDR election arena begins with false statements by the opposition leader about municipalities.

"You don&#39;t have to understand that, right ?????"

"Union chaos: Merkel for CDU against dual citizenship. VdLeyen: Drastic armament, Sch√§uble: family package, Spahn: social cuts."
Only THAT was and is an SPD commitment. Your general-purpose weapon and would-be Chancellor candidate Spahn is expressed in interviews. What applies now?
"CDU wants education fees, massive armament, tax cuts for large earners. SPD wants exemption from fees and relief for normal families!"
Moderate adjustment of the military budget is okay. Billions in armament through social cuts (demand Spahn &amp; Co.) a la CDU - not with us! https://twitter.com/mgrossebroemer/status/853171027127533570‚Ä¶
"Tax cuts for top earners, more money for armament, educational fees for families, privatization of life risks #CDU ---"
"Non-contributory education, parity-financed citizens&#39; insurance, progressive capital taxation, solidarity contribution from top earners! #SPD"
"On Easter weekend, the trolls appear to be running special shifts on social networks. You don&#39;t treat yourself to anything else üòâ"
There is only more justice for everyone with the SPD. Union tax plans help high earners. Union armament plans nobody!
Eliminating the fees from cr√®che to university or master&#39;s certificate relieves families a lot more than the Union&#39;s tax reduction promises!
Free education and help for families instead of German armament records and social cuts. SPD instead of CDU #WirMachenDas #jetztistschulz
Union criticizes that SPD wants to spend more money on education and families. Union wants to drastically increase military spending. Do you notice what ?!

"Those who become strong themselves get options after the choice. Those who opt for options before the election do not become strong themselves, but help others."
(2)! That is why Messrs Tauber and Scheuer as well as Ms Wagenknecht wish the SPD to conduct a coalition election campaign - but we will not do so!
SPD wants to become the strongest force in the federal government and majority on this side of the Union! Coalition election campaign would be the safest way to prevent this. (1)
