Political intersection of the SPD with the attitude of CSU Mann Scheuer is a smooth zero. Scheuer&#39;s semi-strong demeanor is AFD level.
CSU General Scheuer certifies Sigmar Gabriel &quot;personality split&quot; in refugee policy. Scheuer is undoubtedly right!

Friendly reactions in the morning street election campaign for the SPD in Hanover.
"&quot;Because we are for you, they are against us&quot; - brainlessness on posters of right-wing conspiracy theorists. Local election campaign Hannover."
&quot;Only Christian refugees have to be taken in - Syrians should see where they stay&quot; - CSU variant of &quot;Mia san mia&quot; in asylum policy
When the mind slips into lederhosen: CSU wants to grind basic rights. H√∂cke &amp; Co. like.
"In refugee policy, CSU proposals are gradually becoming so right that this is only possible with an absolute CSU majority. Secession of Bavaria?"
"CSU warms up &quot;transit zone&quot; nonsense: internment camps at borders to undermine asylum law - can do CSU with AFD, not with us!"
Have a nice Thursday ;-)
Later to Berlin. Press conference on domestic policy and discussion with the Climate Alliance Berlin. Then campaign support for the Berlin SPD.
Good morning from Hanover. Yesterday election campaign with nice SPD team. Early distribution of information material from the SPD on local elections today.

We have nothing in common with criticism of Angela Merkel from the right (CSU). Yes to humanity - but with integration acts instead of nice speeches!
Then to support the Lower Saxony SPD in the local election campaign. Today appointments in the state capital Hanover. Nice Wednesday ;-)
Also clap for the CDU&#39;s legal policy on domestic politics from Caffier &amp; Henkel to the CDU Schleswig-Holstein. Solve problems instead of symbolic politics!
"A resounding slap in the face for the Chancellor and CDU leader in her home country, where the Union ends up behind the right-wing populists."

Start of this year&#39;s summer tour through Schleswig-Holstein - this time on the topic of justice - today in Neum√ºnster.
Good morning from Munich. After a nice day in the Upper Palatinate and on the SPD mountain tour with Florian Pronold in Lower Bavaria back to SH.
You are (almost) completely right - but just almost ;-) Now everyone can choose the right one üòâ
Bundestag election: Spiegel: Kretschmann visits Merkel - renewed black-green debate - politics - current politics- http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/Spiegel-Kretschmann-besucht-Merkel-Erneute-Schwarz-Gruen-Debatte- id38900727.html‚Ä¶
Nothing power option-declared election goal! Fundamental difference! We do not want a coalition but a majority on this side of the Union!
"It's simply the truth, stupid ;-)"
"In contrast to conservatives, we not only have respect for this, we also don&#39;t want to deny anyone the educational opportunities!"
Kretschmann focuses on law and order in 2017. Social and progressive was yesterday - black-green power option is now official election goal!
"Kretschmann lets black cat out of the bag: the black and green project, which has been flirted with the media for years, is to be implemented in 2017 in the federal government!"
Nice Friday! Bundesliga starts again with Bayern against Werder. The north German HSV fan thinks of green and white ;-)
"In addition, the North CDU educational advancement is obviously a thorn in the side - graduation rate is to deteriorate again. Workers&#39; children? Nope!"
Opposition leader G√ºnther wants to change everything in education policy again. NDR 1 summer interview reveals lack of concept of the North Union.
Tax cuts in favor of highest salaries? No! Investments in education + infrastructure plus relief for families and low earners!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Wonderful summer morning after returning from vacation. Today a few things to do and briefly in Kiel offices.

Hillary Clinton gives her speech modestly and tells of people who have inspired her. #DemsInPhilly
"Many don&#39;t know what rhyme to make on me after years in public office, says Hillary Clinton. #DemsInPh"
&quot;We&#39;re in a country where love trumps hate.&quot; Hillary Clinton accepts the nomination for the Democratic presidential candidate. #DNC
"""Americans don't say I alone can fix it - we say we fix it together"".

AFD greasy comedy in Baden-W√ºrttemberg is an attempt to load the &quot;lie press&quot;. Nix normalos versus radicals - right remains right!
Meuthen&#39;s attempt to pretend that there is a &quot;normal&quot; AFD + radical minority is absurd. AFD is a bunch of right-wing populists + right-wing extremists!
