Integration cannot mean that the local population and immigrants meet halfway and that new culture emerges.
"German #culture culture is much more than the Basic Law: this includes our traditions, our way of life and our common values."
A society disintegrates without common taken for granted. #Leitkultur
It is long overdue that the #culture debate is finally being held in Berlin.
We do not support anything that could lead to the imposition of a death penalty. #Turkey
"The German government must prohibit Erdogan, the despot from the Bosphorus, from holding a Turkish death penalty referendum in Germany. #Turkey"
There must be no vote on German soil that leads to the introduction of the death penalty. #Turkey
"The SPD will be of no use, because everyone realizes that they are misusing the topic as campaign ammunition. I find that unworthy. #ehefueralle"
"Diving and walling must finally come to an end, candidate Schulz has a solid affair on his neck. # complaint"
Rejected asylum seekers must be consistently deported! # Security # Asylum
Now it&#39;s official: The EU Parliament is reprimanding ex-President Schulz for its favoritism.
RT @CSU: # strong as a lion! Red-green is deselected! #ltwnrw
The federal government has made it clear that it would prohibit a referendum in Germany on the introduction of the death penalty in Turkey. OK then.
There must be no vote on German soil that leads to the introduction of the death penalty. That says constitutional law &amp; common sense.
For the CSU it is clear: we do not support anything that could lead to the introduction of a death penalty.
"The Union has better approaches to education, infrastructure and security. The #LTWSH gives tailwind."
The #SchulzEffekt is a minus effect. #LTWSH
"Today&#39;s vote in the legal committee of the Bundestag was the test case for # r2g. From now on it is clear: There is red, red and green in the federal government."
The SPD was clearly voted out of office in Schleswig-Holstein. This is the second crashing defeat in 2017 for the # Schulz-SPD. #LTWSH
"Compilation of the # CSU Bundestag list. All delegates there, let&#39;s go. # btw17 https://t.co/VDrISKryD2"
Basic CSU dialogue with Horst #Seehofer in Rosenheim. Exciting discussion! https://t.co/lu5d3MnLOI
"The level of satisfaction with the state government is high, as is the support for our top personnel, especially among CSU supporters."
"It is clear to everyone: every vote is important, we go full throttle, because only with max. strong CSU can represent Bavarian interests in Berlin."
The CSU has been stable at around 45 percent for months. This is a very good basis for the hot phase of the Bundestag election campaign.
"Discrimination against I reject same-sex partnerships. However, this basic position does not include the so-called #Ehefueralle"
It is correct that the state has its own institution with the registered civil partnership.
Values that are fundamental to our society are also lived in same-sex partnerships. That deserves recognition.
The CSU focuses on marriage and family. I object to any attempt to relativize.
"I will not vote for the so-called #Ehefueralle, because the marriage of husband &amp; wife is rightly under the special protection of the state"
"It is bad enough if the despot from the Bosphorus in Turkey demands the death penalty, in Germany we do not allow this. #Erdogan"
Turkish domestic politics has lost nothing on German soil. It is good that the federal government is following the @ CSU demand and bans Erdogan&#39;s appearance.
"@spdde destroys trust, lip service against # r2g becomes unbelievable. A left-wing alliance must be prevented in the federal election"
"When integrating in Germany, we need a clear compass: our #culture"
Left majority is shamelessly used by the SPD against the Union. @spdde is not in compliance with the contract and pacts with @Die_Gruenen and @dieLinke.

Nothing new from #SchwafelSchulz His personal attacks against the Chancellor fizzle out and show the SPD&#39;s huge perplexity #spdbpt
Many Muslims are not aware of their responsibility to make a statement against political Islam and against terrorism.
"Respect for the organizers, but the refusal of large Islamic associations and the poor visit show a clear picture. #Cologne"
Germany owes a lot to Helmut #Kohl! We mourn the loss of an outstanding Chancellor and a great political role model. https://t.co/0pSI6Npk9A
The surveys clearly show that citizens do not want a left-wing alliance. For the Union it is clear: we are fighting against a left republic.
How deep has the once proud SPD fallen so that after #linkenbpt full of SPD bashing it continues to be a coalition partner for R2G?
"Pension rest ramp is typical SPD policy: change nothing at first, spend money now &amp; postpone financing question into the future"
It is neither innovative nor sustainable. Schulz and Nahles would not have had to wait for Pentecost for this. #Pension
Schulz &amp; Nahles have introduced a residual pension ramp. These are all old Nahles proposals that have already been chewed through in a coalition
In thought to the victims of the London terrorist attack. #prayforLondon https://t.co/2pU91UTBIT

We are pleased that the two chairs of @CSU and @CDU will speak to the people of Munich-Trudering four months before # btw17.
"The decision to reschedule the #Manchester rally was the right one, and I thank everyone interested for their understanding."
It is good news that a new appointment can be made quickly.
The marquee rally in Munich-Trudering with Angela Merkel and Horst Seehofer will now take place on Sunday at 1:00 p.m.

"Now the last one must have understood: We are finally getting justice on Germany&#39;s streets, everyone who uses it also pays. #Toll"
All complainers and doubters have now been punished by the EU Commission. #Toll
@CSU and Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt have prevailed. #Toll
The #toll is coming - now it&#39;s official. Without additional burden for domestic drivers and without discrimination against foreign drivers.
"Dear @sebastiankurz, top decision to run as Chancellor candidate in Austria. Bavaria and @CSU are behind you! All the best!"

The #SchulzZug is deep in the track bed. #ltwNRW # btw17
"Just as #ltwNRW is a defeat for @MartinSchulz, so the election is also a victory for Angela #Merkel."
"The Union has the higher competence values for the important issues of security, infrastructure and education."
"Red-green is deselected - in the so-called #SPD&#39;s home country, in the home of @MartinSchulz, at the small # btw17."
This is the third crushing defeat in a row for the @ spdde chairman and candidate for chancellor @MartinSchulz. #ltwNRW
"#Tunisia, #Algeria + #Morocco must be classified as safe countries of origin. #Asylum #Security #Deportation"

#Seehofer is an excellent Prime Minister and @ CSU Chairman. I&#39;m really glad that he continues. A good day for Bavaria. https://t.co/SAODTzOjH2
"The CSU and CDU have a clear decision, which provides for the return to the option model. #Doppelpass"
The voting behavior of the Turks living in Germany has shown that the double pass is not the correct answer to integration problems.
"Unlike other parties that suddenly discover red lines, we have been saying this for a long time. # Turkey #Referendum"
"We need good economic contacts and security cooperation with # Turkey, but no # EU membership."
Anyone wishing to acquire German citizenship as a child of foreign parents must commit to our values and principles.
The German passport is not a #Ramschartikel that you take along with the # citizenship of the country of origin. #Referendum
After the #Turkey # referendum it is clear that the # double pass will become an election issue. We need to return to the proven option model.
"With this #Referendum, Turkey is canceling the EU accession talks itself."
Turkey voted for the Turkxit. #Referendum
