Today we go back to Berlin. At 10:15 p.m. ZDF discussion with Maybrit Illner on the topic of integration or division of our society
Interesting impressions also from the conversation with the new laboratory chair Jeremy Corbyn. Many new members at Labor.
Sayings against facts or Klöckner against Malu Dreyer. Too bad for Klöckner that Rhineland-Palatinate is doing so well. # Malu16
"Ms. Klöckner does everything &quot;very intensely&quot;, for example putting families in a pocket. Malu Dreyer stands for free education! # Malu16"
Ms. Klöckner constantly says what is &quot;important to me&quot; and unwinds key words. Malu Dreyer is authentically empathic - just real! # Malu16
Ms. Klöckner has rhetorically rehearsed phrases for a TV duel. Malu Dreyer can report with knowledge from good government practice. # Malu16
Ms. Klöckner says what Rhineland-Palatinate needs. Malu Dreyer does what is good for Rhineland-Palatinate. The country is doing well! # Malu16
"Ms. Klöckner pulls up the right symbolic topics, unwinds her PR rhetoric. Malu Dreyer rules with heart and mind. # Malu16"
Ms. Klöckner tries to humanize and delivers humanitarian PR. Malu Dreyer stands and acts for social cohesion. # Malu16
"Ms. Klöckner dispenses with facts, operates with claims and general places. Malu Dreyer knows what she&#39;s talking about. # Malu16"
"In the TV duel Malu Dreyer competent, clear, attentive. Ms. Klöckner poorly informed, polemical, unclear. # Malu16"

The black and yellow parliamentary arm of the gamers&#39; lobby in SH around Arp &amp; Kubicki continues to rely on the principle that &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;.
@altenbockum @UlrichKelber I hardly think so: Asylum package II affects only very few - EU policy is currently rather disastrous.
@altenbockum @UlrichKelber What you call &quot;blind indignation&quot; is an urgently needed distinction from right-wing extremists and enemies of democracy!
Have been saying for months that AFD should be monitored by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Current statements by the enemies of democracy do not surprise anyone!
@altenbockum @UlrichKelber What is the quibble about? Petry &amp; Co. know exactly what they do with militant anti-refugee rhetoric.
Visit to the NDR-Studio and then in the evening constituency appointment in Bredenbek. Have a nice start to the week ;-)
"Disgusting AFD agitation against refugee families, who are looking for protection from war, persecution and misery, on the Petry &amp; Co. want to shoot."
We need an uprising by the decent against the right-wing agitators and democratic enemies of AFD &amp; PEGIDA &amp; Co.-Germany: never right again!
There is nothing to move: AFD shares political responsibility for extreme right-wing acts of violence in Germany! https://twitter.com/dneuerer/status/693437848456945664…
Decent Germans never vote for right-wing extremist AFD gangs that are politically responsible for right-wing violence! AFD also helps not to vote!
"I have already held this up to the AFD chair at &quot;Maischberger&quot;, now she admits that she wants to shoot refugees!"
Refugees used to be shot at the GDR border. AFD boss Petry wants to resume this gruesome legacy at German borders in 2016!

"@RasmusAndresen This is &quot;only&quot; about subsidiary protection. Wouldn&#39;t be an SPD wish anyway, but you can represent the whole package."
@RasmusAndresen Not quite - compromise must still be justifiable in practice and must not violate humanitarian standards!

The challenge for the SPD remains to enforce the necessary integration policy in Germany against pubescent CSU without a humanitarian compass!
(4) Still annoying that new compromise was only necessary because of the CSU boycott of the November agreements! No solution strengthens AFD!
(3) Refugee families who are still in war zones are not affected. Situation in refugee camps urgently in need of improvement!
(2) Improvement for young people + priority family reunification with quotas for refugee camps! Affected by subsidiary protection.
Family reunification restrict neither Christian nor social + not SPD attitude! Compromise with CDU + crazy CSU only justifiable in the overall package (1)
