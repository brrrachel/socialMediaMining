Europe builds on solidarity. Whoever takes must also give.
Consistent application of asylum law: Those who are not persecuted cannot stay.
The values of the Basic Law are not negotiable. This must be clear to everyone from the start.
We urgently need to remove bureaucratic hurdles on the labor market. #Refugees
We need adequate and sustainable funding for countries and municipalities. #Refugees
"@Blackhalflife accept more people in the SL than we have to. Centers need prerequisites (space, transport links) that we don&#39;t have"
Now decision interior minister good sign. I wish that Chancellor will succeed in establishing solidarity among heads of state.
Europe must not give the impression that its currency is more important to it than the suffering of the refugees.
"To do this, we have to act decisively and wisely in Europe, Germany and Saarland."
"Our goal: We want to help people, we want to master the challenges and we want to take advantage of the opportunities that lie therein."
Government declaration: helping people - mastering challenges - seizing opportunities. Integration of refugees as a task for society as a whole
"With Hans Ley, we not only lost an excellent representative of the state parliament, but also a good adviser and loyal friend."
"Right decision, necessary signal! https://twitter.com/swrinfo/status/646348712579612672…"

Consultations on the refugee situation are now starting in the Chancellery. Doing the national task together. That has to succeed.
"That is the task for politics. Then, but only then, can we do it. I am confident that we will succeed."
"But we can only master this if the course is set correctly in Europe, in Germany and with us."
"We want to help people, master the challenges and seize the opportunities."
"New hotline &#39;Refugee Aid&#39; for all questions about the topic, but also for very specific problems or complaints Tel. 0681-5012223"
"We will make the necessary funds available, for example for schools, vocational training or universities."
"First and foremost, I think of the rapid and consistent integration into the job market, but also in our clubs, in the neighborhood"
I want those who can stay in our country to become actively involved in our society.
Private living space is urgently needed. Please report vacant apartments Tel. 501-2223 and fluechtlingshilfe@saarland.de # Refugees
"Special thanks go to all helpers at the State Admission Office in Lebach, especially to the Lebachers for their understanding."
Coping with the refugee issue is a major effort for everyone. Thank you all full-time and volunteers for self-sacrificing efforts.
The Basic Law applies to everyone and must be accepted.
"Our demands for the refugee summit: admission procedures hand in hand, faster procedures, consistent application of asylum law."
"We see friendly faces, fearful and those full of hate. It is in our hands which face is imprinted. #Refugees"
Need common asylum and refugee policies and common protection of our European borders. #Schengen
"Restrictions on the funding programs: Even if this is not legally possible now, we have to change this for the future."
Those who want to receive solidarity financial support but do not want to bear any burdens must also accept restrictions in the support programs.
