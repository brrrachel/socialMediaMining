Very constructive discussion in the Rio +20 environmental committee
Just in passing: Tomorrow the BMU will have its own Twitter account!
Let&#39;s go to work!
@ Piratenfrank Have fun with your opinion! :-)
@stephanframke :-))
@DennyRamone Thanks!
", @ haraldo1960 What you can rely on :-)"
"@sven_kindler thoughts are free. However, there are currently no draft laws on the EEG. You can switch off the agitation mode again :-)"
"@ChrisMichalak But of course they can found new parties at any time, like the pirates did ..."
"@scanlines you sharp thinkers! :-) But if almost everyone else thinks it&#39;s good, it is astonishing that in one faction everyone is against it"
@Gaming_Dude In democracy there must be majorities as well as arguments. CDU / CSU have always struggled with the topic.
@UlrichKelber :-))
"@stober_stephan Usually: yes. Nevertheless, there can be exceptions if someone agrees differently due to personal concern or experience."
@peterausge There is nothing wrong with that: CDU / CSU are very common.
The left has once again voted against an important European project: #fail #fraction constraint
"Today was a great day for our democracy because the CDU / CSU, SPD, FDP, Greens pulled together in the fiscal pact and ESM."
Only then will voters be able to see which policies government and opposition stand for.
"Each Member of the Bundestag decides what a conscience decision is for him. Nevertheless, it usually makes sense to vote with your own group. 1.2"
I didn&#39;t need @TiloJung @tj_tweets faction pressure. I said that was not a question of conscience. But every MdB decides for itself
"@Rolf_Schaefer everything is so easy. Degression with a sense of proportion, maintaining the expansion goals, slowing down the pace"
. @ UBahnKollektiv I received the people who collected the signatures and discussed them with them
@henninghenke you shouldn&#39;t expect too much from my cooking skills :-)
"@TiloJung no, that was not a question of conscience - I am very liberal on this question, but of course I agree with my group"
"@ Soest64 Yes, especially when it is so late. Tonight I was on the BBC late night show to defend the euro!"
"@docanonymous_ r So I voted with my group. As a minister, I should do that too. Thanks for the congratulations the other day!"
"@ Heinz20122 Actually on many topics, especially the environment. Now that I am a minister :-)"
@tmmd thanks for the tip
"@gain_up Sure, but the best thing to do is send it to me in writing. Not by mail but old-fashioned by letter."
@ Soest64 Unfortunately I can&#39;t always answer. Because now and then I still have to rule! :-) Greetings to Soest!
"@AnneWillTalk otherwise always and gladly, but unfortunately I can not move."
"@AnneWillTalk dear AnneWill team, that&#39;s a real shame, but that evening I cook for my old professor who comes to Berlin"
. @ monongahelaMD You were really careful! I leave the unpleasant tweets to the others. :-) But I want to be serious!
@einfranz I&#39;m really lucky because unfortunately I understand very little about football :-)
"@ Guenni11 Thank you, did not see that you were there too! :-)"
"@JanDoerrenhaus Yes, but we are currently there. We also help against unfair competition from abroad."
@robert_we I will ensure transparency in my area: give me a few months.
@HelmutDelker It is quite possible that solar systems will be profitable without any subsidies.
@Linnewicz is because they have become so much cheaper. We have also freed the small systems from market integration.
@DerRotschopf The electricity will not get cheaper anytime soon. But it&#39;s about keeping the price within reasonable limits.
"@ FNOMIS67 Well, always stop at work. But a lot of people answered! :-))"
"@Duesenberg_ Electricity has become 3% more expensive for private households last year. Not nice, but less than many think."
"@GYGeorg Yes still in there, but no longer for small systems up to 10 kw. They have their own interest in using as much electricity as possible."
"@Media cigar If there aren&#39;t gates soon, you should switch off and read my tweets! :-))"
@ aotto1968_2 @UlrichKelber The topic of recycling for renewables is huge. Eg also for used solar systems.
@Mainboarder Not quite: there are electricity consumers who pay no taxes and taxpayers who pay little electricity.
@dhaerle :-))
@CDittmayer That&#39;s why I also spread it via tweet!
"@skglas Yes, I think that&#39;s really nice - even if they somehow rumble about the energy transition."
@Duesenberg_ There are many reasons. Old people&#39;s pensions have often not increased as much as inflation over the past 15 years
"@SunTsu In 2022 there will be no more nuclear power in Germany, that is crucial."
@Elektronews You are right. We have to try to reduce costs on all sides
"@ schwabe90 Not for the energy-intensive industries at all, because they hardly pay the levy."
@dhaerle Guaranteed to help me. They&#39;re my friends from the pizza connection
"@ Corleone1952 No, just spent. But if it helps me with my work, it&#39;s a good cause ... :-)"
"@dhaerle They bring Altmaier, RÃ¶sler, Merkel in photomontage with their eyes closed and talk about the energy transition ..."
Today the green tax money was spent to increase my awareness with an advertisement (eg SZ)! It was a great idea! :-)
"@ Pattern buffer in DDR VKammer was synchronized, with us Reg u Opp only pull together if it is really important"
"@Elektronews Offshore is still in the start-up phase, but in the medium term it is particularly cheap because the wind is almost always blowing there."
"Solar compromise is good news for the energy transition. We are making progress in expanding renewable energies, but electricity remains affordable."
"Solar power has a secure future in Germany, but subsidies are being cut. This limits loads for electricity consumers!"
I am very pleased that the Conciliation Committee has found a good solution for solar power funding this evening. Beyond party borders.
@MichaelGunczy What you can rely on!
@piratenflotte Thank you! Ready to board!
@martingreve If you can. But I don&#39;t have soccer eyes. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t hit that much earlier. It&#39;s better in politics!
@ Alex14ng i like catalonia a lot. But you must understand that I cannot interfere here
@Hermann_Ott Unep is upgraded. The dispute is about whether it will be a special organization. Hardly any government leader understands the difference
@Hermann_Ott of course you can open it. Then changes in all directions are possible. What should be the big point for that?
@nilsstuetzle much smaller. About a third or a quarter
@hddoger I do not understand: many people do not know what it costs if the iron runs without ironing or the TV is standby
@ jolicoeur11 you should know! :-)
". @ hanno w @ there we have to ensure transparency, for example, waschm, dishwasher, refrigerator, etc. There are already good ones. But unknown sites"
"@Jowelexx the insult is very wrong. In fact, since I have always spoken of help through advice. See Mirror interv"
@Xylophilon just blocked you
@ 0711thomas well observed! I directed myself to the Ministry
@AndyGER We are at the beginning of a long debate and from now on I will take an active part in it!
@Ralf_Stegner It is still urgently needed and I am convinced that the SPD will also agree with a large majority: For Europe!
@ grubi22 @ broadcast Thanks for the tip. Energy mix is a national issue. Otherwise we would not have been able to get out of nuclear power plants so easily
"@ PilotChris_1 of course, the pv belongs to the future in the long run"
@ haraldo1960 there will soon be a report from the eu
@ haraldo1960 Wg session week I can not personally to Intersolar. I will speak publicly about PV later this week
@erik_fluegge :-))
@erik_fluegge The sign forest not ever. The leaf forest is my daily bread. The fairytale forest is my childhood dream!
@ FlyHippie1971 Probably. Just send it again. Thank you
Thank you for letters to forest protection. Detailed answer is coming. Stand up for WS in Rio and will have a dialogue with us on forest here.
"@ Kyra2001 SPD / Greens / SSW did not understand that pirates tick differently: no coalition, but cooperation if there is agreement"
"Looking forward to my first EU environmental council and getting to know my colleagues. Above all will address Rio, climate finance and environmental action program."
"@thomassteins @LSU_Bund Gladly. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be there in the afternoon, but the evening was really nice!"
"@BasementBoi By thinking, love of language, a bit of happy, friendly mockery. Of course you have to judge whether it works :-)"
@LukasGriesbaum Then a warm greeting back!
@monongahelaMD :-))
. @ kl_motte @ aired You always say such a strange anti-EU stuff! Too bad :-)
"@Mittsommar No, I&#39;m not advocating any additional subsidies now. First create order in the thicket."
"@tmmd @ TheBug0815 @andyger Definitely, as is the case with garbage separation today. Then it is in the blood later"
@fonsox Wetten dass ... not !!!
@yrthy I&#39;somehow the link wasn&#39;t quite there? :-)
"@ schild202 The escalation was not noticed for a long time. I picked it up from day one, but I can&#39;t witch"
@inuido @caechter already tweeted something about it and will look at it.
"The super Gau tweets mean that tweets are not read by others. Too bad. Say how many you are, but please don&#39;t spam"
@CDUBiblis agree. But that was before my time as a BMU. Now we have to look ahead. Feel free to drop by Biblis.
The issue of nuclear power has been eaten. But not everyone is happy about the expansion of renewables. That is why the energy transition must be successful
To all super-Gau Twitterers: Work at full speed to make the energy transition a success in 2022. Your action is not helpful for the renewables.
@ co2online thank you for the great offer. Unfortunately I have to go straight to the next environmental event!
"@infratestdimap I&#39;m happy too. Was unfortunately long in Meseberg, but the topics were very important: energy transition and growth!"
"@UlrichKelber risks tweeting with uncertainty, which falls back on him because it has little to do with reality and party politics."
"@BenBussiek After all, I&#39;m a founding member of the &quot;black-green pizza connection&quot; :-)"
@Klaus_Schulze And then you are probably a bot! :-))
Environment Week is great: thousands exchange ideas and motivate each other.
"@TransEnergyGER The expansion of renewables must continue, preferably in the planned corridor: PV approx. 3.5 GW / year."
"@digitalkontakt they do that all the time, but not every time and to everyone, because the number of requests is simply too high."
"@LevSPD @BMU_de Would appreciate that, but must first check how the practices are in the BMU. Please send mail."
. @ sandraenkhardt What is here is not serious. Did not comment on the future of the EEG but now wants a good compromise in the roast
@Killikus the idea is not bad: do you have any suggestions?
"@k_spar Nah, signs were still there. But I thought it was easier to grip. Despite accusative! :-) # intelligibility"
@danielmack That belongs first in the section &quot;well-intentioned proposals cost&quot;. But it&#39;s my turn &quot;E-turn / low-income&quot;
. @ UlrichKelber There is no reason for this: See my interview in the original. But the turnaround will only succeed if everyone is in the boat + trust each other.
I&#39;m really happy that my PGF successor @MGrosseBroemer has already written over 100 tweets! Now all he has to do is learn to cook! :-)
@ RAF2attac I have been in favor of Fukushima and will continue to be in the future.
"@xoryps A lot is conceivable, but unfortunately I don&#39;t see how we should finance it."
@stephanframke did you send that too :-)?
@rauskucker you were careful! I&#39;m out and it stays that way
@rauskucker What did I say in the TS? Was a long press statement and don&#39;t know what they brought ...
"I want our solar industry here + to have a chance on the world market. Wherever there is dumping, I will take action. @UlrichKelber"
@red_hardliner :-)) !  #Twitter
@Organstreit next week Tuesday for work and Wednesday for official takeover! #Bonn
"@HwSchwager There you have a real point. Generally wants to change that, but in that case the students will probably find it &quot;cool&quot; :-))"
"I am looking forward to the start of the campaign for GreenDay, right now at 10.00 with students, companies and crafts!"
@Zoor I don&#39;t know. But I&#39;m on duty around the clock!
@Zoor The new BMU is coming to Saarland at Pentecost! Wondering if he&#39;ll meet pirates there? CDU students and JU students in any case! And @_A_K_K_
@tokoo And only in the meantime! It&#39;s really fun! #cnetz
"@ PsychoTR0N Oh, very good! Work wherever you look, but really exciting, almost like pirates."
@c_netz The #cnetz is also a great invention that deserves attention.
@kalehill that was really quick!
@susannewiest You are right.
@UlrichKelber Thank you for the congratulations and kind comments! Good cooperation!
From now on I&#39;m on Twitter more often. I only tweet on my account. My employees on the new BMU account.
@ feinschmecker62 Iâm going to drink another one! Best regards!
@Elektronews Then I hope you switched off the TV quickly! So that they can continue to speak to me on Twitter!
@ KarlOtto3 But very thick!
"@D_Mikami Mon Dieu, but I really wasn&#39;t the only one bashing! :-)"
@sashtown Greetings to the Palatinate!
@ aotto1968_2 @D_Mikami Thanks for the support!
"@Grisoulover Not seen yet, I just got home."
@Quer_Denker Logo! Mrs. Nahles promised me after the show!
@igorakkerman Don&#39;t worry. But I hadn&#39;t strapped it right away. So a little celebrated.
"@ReinhardSchinka Thanks for the offer, but I&#39;m doing the CDU quite well, too? &#39;! :-)"
@AlexB_DE Thank you! I really appreciate your praise!
@BenjaminHudler Thank you and on new deeds!
@towelie09 :-))
@metapeter People need happiness! Thank you and good night! :-)
"@Pascal_Reddig Best regards to Hessen! By the way, JU did extremely well in the election campaign in NRW!"
@Karin_Wolff And it is even more fun when competent and nice colleagues watch you! :-))
@leumasmot :-))
"@_Social_Angels Yes, I was determined because it is not possible for everyone to fool around first and then complain about the overgrowth of customs!"
"@Dscherid @andreanahles It&#39;s not the starting point that matters, but that you try to make the best of it. HG!"
"@CM_stern @Bruder_Tack Yes, I was really #n ticking around, the foreplay scene had somehow not completely checked."
"@kleinbenny because then skilled workers, employees and normal pensioners would have to pay even more. There are also no social tariffs for water and fuel"
"@ futschi01 yes in principle, but unfortunately it has increased for private households"
Have been sitting for hours waiting for text from the presidency. 1.15. Local time.
@ aotto1968_2 54 madness
Thanks for all birthday wishes! Looks like you get older as a minister. Something like that :-)
"@Volker_Beck Certainly not, but you welded us together properly!"
"@HeinenUlla thanks, now that I come, the calm is over for the delegation ..."
"@piratenGOE Green Economy, Upgrade fÃ¼r Unep, Sustainable Development Goals"
@ aj7691 5 hours back
"Hardly in Rio, I&#39;m stuck in traffic. Brazilians have negotiated and presented paper. But it can&#39;t stay that way."
@ TheBug0815 I don&#39;t know. At the moment inquiries are coming from all sides. Please send it in writing. Always do what I can. ;-)
@rennradfreak @Piratenpartei But then I would definitely not be Minister for the Environment and I couldnât do that much! :-)
". @ lotzblumberg As soon as it works efficiently, it&#39;s great. But we are not there yet (unfortunately)"
@adfoew If you read my FTD article you will find that the solar industry has not been written so positively for a long time.
". @ GruenChristian The Altmark is of course something really fine: Bismarck, Stendal etc. It is always worth a detour!"
@FitFinger I haven&#39;t noticed much of breaks in the last few weeks!
". @ JuliaKloeckner It is quite astonishing: the fewer tweets I send, the more the number of followers grows! :-))"
"@UlrichKelber, of course, these are General Hill!"
"@UlrichKelber Yes, because we are going to the prime ministerial conference because of the energy transition! Also very important for the environment"
". @ annettestr I will definitely get to it, but at the moment I am busy with both ears. Bye for now"
"@piejae @ AndreR241 Yes, that would be a good idea, for example"
@bavarianrebel @ jr32105 Definitely. The list of Twitter names could be put online. Then you can answer collectively or individually
"@JonasMaurer Yes, of course, I remember: Then you were definitely in my BMI office for coffee and cake with the whole family!"
. @ jr32105 An idea with mass tweets would be that the drawing can be done online and the recipient will be informed about the number in a tweet.
At the big sustainability congress of DGB etc. Great preparation for Rio!
@_Stumbling blocks_ Who are the stumbling blocks dedicated to?
"@MarcusGastel I mean: if you don&#39;t use it, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing! :-)"
"@ Heinzandreas Sure, give me trouble. But mostly I only get a tweet now and then."
"@JonasMaurer Help me on the jumps: when was that ca? Trainee? When you tell me context, I definitely remember."
"@SteinbachErika I can only underline that. Glaiube, it&#39;s their turn to fix the T-fix in the office."
". @ SteinbachErika I&#39;m happy too. It&#39;s really fun because many help. Get bombarded by T requests, but you were among the first!"
"@rttgen Well, you little fake! The attempt was cute but hopeless! :-)"
". @ SarahFreitag1 @la_tomtom can unfortunately not answer every tweet, but Twitter is good for keeping your feet firmly in place! :-)"
. @ LA_tomtom Back then I realized that we totally underestimate the importance of the internet. The dynamics of change anyway. :-)
"Greetings from Brussels to Ole von Beust, Regina GÃ¶rner, all participants u the LSU for a great idea! I wish you exciting debates!"
"After working on IT-Netz u Strom-Netz, now working on the personal network of relationships in Brussels: Good discussions with commissioners and MEPs."
"@mirotwitt I now know that you can filter that. But I don&#39;t want to block someone, I rely on insight."
"@Schmidtlepp you just have to see that you become a minister, otherwise I will see black! :-)"
@Schmidtlepp :-)
@ Heinrich2013 That&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s about.
"@drmfuchs If we both stick together, it is a signal for everyone: the environment and the economy can only win together."
". @ UlrichKelber Above all, you shouldn&#39;t underestimate me :-) I want the energy transition to succeed !!!"
"@UlrichKelber I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too high, but I want to know where we are and what needs to be done!"
@Neven_DuMont Read tomorrow the Spiegel and Wirtschaftswoche. I cannot influence summaries.
"We don&#39;t take the wind out of our sails, but set them so that the energy transition really gets going! There is no way back!"
@Neven_DuMont On the contrary: I want the energy transition to succeed !!!
"@KLinnemann @sigmargabriel FDP, Greens and Leftists were of course also there!"
It was really good that @sigmargabriel + I were together in the aces. Has encouraged many! The best thing: the support cage has held!
@Cyrus_McDugan Yes I do. Ducking away doesn&#39;t do anything
@piratenGOE Every MP has to vote on topics of which he has no picture of his own. Even pirate MdL! :-)
"@JottEs to my staff or to me personally, when it comes to an encounter. Will try to talk to the demonstrators."
Today I visit the aces to get information directly from those affected and to get my own picture.
@ThomasEllerbeck oh yes. I had completely forgotten! :-)
@ sefi99 :-))
@ sefi99 Are you in USA now? It&#39;s almost more beautiful than Minister! :-)
@kl_motte Gib mir &#39;ne Chance! :-)
@UweSchummer That is not bad at all. And that with drinking will definitely be! :-)
@yonny_s @MGrosseBroemer Oh thanks! There are still nice people!
"@tillkommentiert Every beginning is difficult, but it will! :-)"
One last thank you to everyone who endured and supported me as Parliamentary Managing Director! Now Bellevue
"Greetings to all participants in the Saarlouis network dialogue! Unfortunately cannot come because of a new task as BMU, but remain true to the network policy!"
@dominikrzepka @haekelschwein Thank you. And we are guaranteed to catch up!
"@dominikrzepka @ZDF ice cream is unhealthy anyway! At any time, but until the official appointment on Tuesday I do not appear publicly :-)"
@WSchDsch ;-))
@AnthChirp I&#39;m not a minister yet: only with the certificate of appointment next week!
@KPS_BAVC That&#39;s right!
PS: If I now become a BMU: Where does it actually say that these networks only refer to the electricity networks? :-)
"I am overwhelmed by all the wishes, reactions, suggestions. Can not read + answer everything at all. But I&#39;m very happy! :-)"
Thanks to everyone for congratulating me on my appointment as Minister for the Environment. I need your support even more now! Bye for now!
@siegstyle I believe you well and gladly! :-)
@sashtown :-))
Luckily @hubertus_heil was with the A Nahles at Hartaberfair and agreed that she would invite me to currywurst.
@Haetscher @hubertus_heil I never saw him! Was still at Hartaberfair
"@ Marco5sge Unfortunately it is not only England, but also 2, 3 states in the euro area. But I am convinced that it will come soon."
"@ WolfgangExler You were great motivated and fought great. Unfortunately, circumstances weren&#39;t. But you are an excellent citizen politician"
@MarcusHeiner Spontaneous anger is not a good guide: Always stay nice and creamy! Greetings to Jena!
@SvenHolm I think the viewers should make up their own mind!
@zweibohnen Then I would have something wrong with the pirates. So I can occasionally praise her from the outside. :-)
. @ Sepp49 Pirates are a factor. But I find them interesting and most of them have no blinders.
"@robert_schuette I wasn&#39;t immediately aware of the possible meaning, so I messed around a bit. Sorry."
"@ Flow_871 Habs not seen it himself, but it was fun."
@RAASCLAD Thank you. It was also fun tonight - despite the rather dreary occasion for me! :-)
"@tobilo_DE I was pretty restrained with bashing, but sometimes you should listen to a rough block ..."
"@ KarlOtto3 @RAASCLAD You are right, but nobody asked me about it! :-("
"@ chrisjaeger83 Thank you, and best regards to Bitburg!"
@Isengrinn @zdf I never saw it because I was fair but fair at Hart.
"@ Marco5sge Sure I&#39;m there. All the time, even if the path is rocky."
Elections are easier: you just have to be happy. I am curious if I can make a contribution to the reworking at ARD-Hart-aber-fair.
@ReuterAndreas encouraging your own party friends is one of them.
@gert_korn Of course. With particular pleasure I whistle the song &quot;When the Romans got cheeky ...
"@Dandii Not yet, but we&#39;re working on it :-)"
"@ReuterAndreas there he was thoroughly misunderstood, he says :-)"
@nixblick the surveys for Hannelore Kraft were amazingly precise! :-)
@MarcoWedel :-))
". @ hschmidt CDU grew in Rhineland-Palatinate, Berlin, Saarland. Held in SH result. Crash in NRw is out of line."
@m_schoenherr but at least a start! :-)
@BabatundeOgboru Not at all. Just wanted to make sure that the SPD doesn&#39;t lose grip :-)
"The SPD tweets morning air, but NRW was only the exception, not the rule! In the federal government stable non-majority for SPD / Green in all surveys"
"@AEichholtz Oh well, you thought you heard one of my radio int this morning. :-)"
@AEichholtz Harder than what and where?
@JoschaJ @Schmidtlepp @GordonGniewosz That&#39;s how I thought it. But it sounded really pathetic ...
"@GordonGniewosz @Schmidtlepp Exactly, long before there were pirates! #Zukunftspartei"
@saveeverything The suit is just my overalls. But today is the weekend! :-)
@Schmidtlepp @GordonGniewosz This is how it should be: Common politics serving voters! :-)
@Schmidtlepp :-))
@Schmidtlepp I only noticed when I was on my bike with a summer shirt. Dress warm!
@phjdijkman mainly because the interpretation of the C by CDU certainly does not meet the expectations of the CDA
"@phjdijkman Thank you very much. I am very happy to write a contribution for the bundle, but the subject does not seem particularly suitable."
@henningtillmann who said what in what context?
@Ralf_Stegner join me in congratulations. Looking forward to a good Twitt-together
"@scanlines no leeway for debt, because the debts are already huge. Otherwise I fight for regulation #FTT, for example"
@scanlines politics must not be subordinated to the markets. But the markets decide which government bonds to buy at what interest rates
"@Lanzenheim Dear @sigmargabriel, this is follower power! Any nonsense / hypocrisy will be recognized promptly! The network is just great!"
@sigmargabriel @cducsu I am of course pleased about every important new follower who takes my Twitter style as an example .. :-)
". @ Carnosaurus That was not just an allusion, but a very big clue, I&#39;m afraid! :-)"
@LKwesiJ At least there are German politicians who think they speak French ... :-)
"@JTrittin Would be strange if the Greens do not support the Greens (u CDU the UMP). Nevertheless, we have cross-party responsibility for D / F-Bez."
"@pettre He is still alive, he is fine!"

The voters swapped the Left for the #Pirates in #SH. I&#39;ve seen worse deals! :-) Congratulations to Kiel!
@MargotKaesemann as long as you spell my name so wrong ... :-)
Perplexity at the SPD in Berlin: Neither the strongest party nor the red / green majority. SPD trees don&#39;t grow in the sky!
@Meseberg Hony be who thinks so! :-)
@sigmargabriel @bierlennium You are right! I am glad that you have found your way to us: for a sporty get together!
@awillburger comes because we took Kath social teaching u Soz Mw very seriously. Property also for not so rich I like Saarland!
@maltespitz Actually I interpreted your secret wishes :-)
"@hubertus_heil You are also awake sxchon! Anyway, I&#39;m going to save the euro again at the Kath Akademie Trier!"
"@themroc But the beck was preceded by @, which was answered :-)"
@Volker_Beck I have only specified the nice wishes of @maltespitz!
@laszloriedl I only speculated about the secret wishes of @maltespitz!
"Well roared lion! @Maltespitz probably wants black-green for SH, Sarko for F and PASOK for HE"
@nminkmar :-))
@PeterPaulPanter We really tweeted a lot today. But more replies!
"@PeterPaulPanter On average, I didn&#39;t tweet that much more than you! :-) And the followers seem to like it."
@kinzmill Was there more than him in the last six months. You will see me again tomorrow evening at about 6.10 pm on ARD and ZDF for the regional election. :-)
"@nminkmar My God! You are right. Besides, from time to time the confusion of languages leads us to a better European spirit!"

We are very happy that we have @SteinbachErika on Twitter. And soon there will be a lot more! @papapreuss @SteinbachErika
". @ larsklingbeil Just praised you in my tweet. I don&#39;t know exactly how to fix that, but you&#39;re a nice guy!"
"Alright, somehow. Sometimes I wish my tweets were as profound and self-critical as yours! :-) @sven_kindler"
@ Government4tel I have to watch Monday. The Fiuskal Pact argues the other way around: How you do it .... :-)
@PenZiuM You can also learn to love! It&#39;s never too late! :-))
@JanWoellner @Ralf_Stegner @Aniobitom So it is. And her soul ...
"Sorry, of course! @Meseberg"
"Well, everything can get better. But compared to the social friends it is true! (But I don&#39;t let anything come on @larsklingbeil!) @IZicke"
"A little sucked off but still good: the network is not everything, but without the network everything is no longer right! @HollyGoMadly"
But you know: it is never over! We live in the Global village! :-)) @PenZiuM
@DWoehrl :-))
"My still, the @Ralf_Stegner would be the better SPD candidate. Strong on Twitter, substance + you can rub it @Aniobitom"
. @ sashtown The best thing is that you can only see my media figure on Twitter and not the actual one! :-)) Thank you for the flowers!

@Aneristiker His statement was much worse than Delius&#39; because it suggests right-wing extremists. Unfortunately it was very typical.
