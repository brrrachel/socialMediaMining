But he doesn&#39;t have to demonstrate. He can act. This instrument is not meant for the government.
Would probably be an improvement
"Demonstrations are designed so that citizens who have no options for action can express their will and then take the incumbent into account as they please.

"State film funding is not private and fundamental rights are defense rights against the state, otherwise you would not need an AGG, for example."
"Yes, that&#39;s another problem. Dreams have to be allowed."
Plickert&#39;s tweet was too general for me.
"I wish that private (!) Employment relationships can be terminated, tenancy agreements not entered into, etc., for whatever reason (&quot;objectionable&quot;). The employee chooses AfD or SPD, the tenant is black, white or a woman with a cat ..."
"To put it more precisely: The case of the STATE FILM funding in Hesse is a scandal. But in private, we have massively curtailed freedom of contract with various laws."
Naturally!
There is a constant expansion. But originally that was a right to defend against the state.
"Yes, it is definitely problematic. I wrote that."
Testified or &quot;from&quot;
"Ah, you think government film funding is private. Ok, not smart, but at least open your face."
"Even if he were a cynical despot, he enjoys support as long as more cynical and lying media hack at him. If they continue like this, they will also get a constitutional amendment for a third term."
As precise as you.
Then a member of parliament should look into it.
"Oh yes, and because I know it from Pegida, I ask."
"For this purpose, he planned an event with the two NRW wing exponents Blex and Röckemann, which was canceled due to the threat to the host. What does that mean for status and future in NRW."

My tweet distinguishes very clearly between state and private.

No
You should differentiate. Government agencies: No Private employment: A very free country in which there is actually freedom of contract.

In German: Weidel and Höcke have a deal. Weidel goes publicly into the swamp to reaffirm this and Kubitschek gives her his stage to show: One of us!
&quot;Weidel&#39;s presentation with us is a first open sign that&quot; in the safety of silence &quot;a lot has already been spoken well.&quot; Kubitschek at @TichysEinblick
Or was it Kubitschek? At least one of the Schnellroda knights.

"If Boris Johnson is supposed to be “couping” against Parliament, what does it say about Labor that people are opposed to new elections in this situation. After all, one could vote out the “putschist” Johnson with new elections. 😉"
I&#39;m not talking about expertise in all three cases. But they are the better chess players.
So victory in full line for Johnson. The Brexit is coming anyway and it now even has the legitimation of the lower house.
"While German media celebrate Boris Johnson&#39;s defeat, he is happy about his victory. Johnson understands strategy and tactics and is currently 3-0 up. The Brexit is coming and this end of the hanging game for the UK comes to an end."
Because it&#39;s been an open secret for two years.
Okay
You just have to see who Kalbitz specifically integrates in Brandenburg.
Then Kubitschek apparently removed a lot from the network.

You also write for the same sheet as Höcke&#39;s press spokesman.
"As long as people like you become decent people in the same pot with these people, there will be no differentiation between real and accepted extremism."
"When I told him that I would do everything I could to prevent him from getting a leg on the floor on the federal AfD board. To this day, journalists say that I saw Lucke together with him in July of the same year, which is simply wrong and defamatory. But please"
My only and consequently last personal conversation with Höcke was in April 2015.
"Nobody wanted to see that we had a bitter fight. We have been personally attacked for this. Right down to drugs, right?"
Nothing but lies http: //xn--sddeutsche-9db.desüddeutsche.de I laughed!
Do not underestimate the determination of certain steering circles in and behind the AfD.
"Kubitschek is openly committed to fascism, dozen times! This is where Höcke comes from. Weidel, Meuthen, Hartwig (the internal official Nazi hunter), Jongen and tens of others appear there. Höckes book is the resurrection exactly of the NSDAP. He just needs a little more fire."
"Hessen since 2018, Saarland since 2017. Otherwise this is the 16th fraction that cracks. In addition in the EP in the last legislative period."
I would do it.
"By the way, I strongly advise against coalitions!"
There was no talk of coalition. You should calm down.
The question is whether you want to win back AfD voters at some point or whether the horizon is five years wide.
At least that&#39;s how the media reported it.
And
"You&#39;re right. The problem: You have already shouted Nazi a thousand times where it was nonsense. No sow is listening to you anymore, which is unfortunate in this special case."
"I would even agree that it wasn&#39;t otherwise completely wrong, given the circumstances."
I just point out that one should not “win” very often.
Then please read the tweet I replied to again. There was something about great victory.
"But this was an &quot;ab&quot;, wasn&#39;t it?"
Yes impressive -7%. Another four such victories and you are below 5%.
"Nazi is derived from soci. National socialist. Whatever you do there is abundant on the net, but it is a complete bullshit."
The AfD has been stagnating for 3 years. Why?
A nice example of what incredible nonsense you can write today without noticing. Precisely because there was something even more idiotic in the FAZ.
"Don&#39;t do it. But hardly anyone understands what that is today, thanks to our media."
Liste14 Not in the mood for Kalbitz and Höcke https://twitter.com/Wahlrecht_de/status/1167563098384982016…
"12 years in the life of a Nazi Kalbitz 2007: With Udo Voigt and swastika flag in Athens. Kalbitz 2019 to students: Höcke is not a Nazi, but is firmly on the ground of the liberal-democratic basic order. Yes, if he says that! ☝️"
"But really, because of a little swastika flag. That is really not a problem in the AfD."
"So much for the German dream, the British no longer wanted Brexit. https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1167555783799779328…"
"Incidentally, the AfD can still look forward to receiving mail. We will not leave that alone."
"In an emergency, the hack tastes good without bread."
"Just it. Grimace, tone of voice and accompanying arm movements tended not to be suitable for the table. But we start small."
My 2-year-old son roars furiously at me: &quot;Please give !!!&quot; Two findings. 1. I still have a lot of educational work to do. 2. First successes give hope.
And that&#39;s not all at Kalbitz.
Deputy federal chairman of the AfD hoists the swastika flag. Can happen. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://twitter.com/akm0803/status/1167310596410241025…
Never been
"The problem that ends up failing is always the growing parasitic self-service shops in socialism that are establishing themselves. From this point of view, the new experiment begins with an 8 billion mortgage."
Höcke does something like that in D. Obviously no one gets upset in the AfD.
"New European spatial planning, loss of parts of the population, politically prescribed new popular religion and then googling uomo virtuoso by Macchiavelli. Höcke needs and wants total destruction for his vision. Crazy? Yes, completely!"
Höcke was never mine!
"Ok, we agree. AfD and SPD are one league."

"I could bring something like that out of the CDU or, or, or ..."
"By the way, all screenshots from 24 h."
"What I want to say is that there is a level of dissatisfaction that the majority of the media are no longer able to get a grip on. The question is, can it be changed / replaced constructively or does it end in media chaos."
Net hangs. Kretschmer&#39;s network!

In 2015 it was still the level of criticism from the AfD. pic.twitter.com/3wHphJw2dE
"@rasenspiesser We recently had a short discussion about how much constructive destruction of existing media offers is necessary. Here are three screenshots. One from the FDP, one from the SPD, a FAZ journalist."
Can we please delete the FAZ?
"&quot;The debate that Mr. Maassen started then hurt us to the extent that he extended it, and I personally take that very badly at him.&quot; What is @MPKretschmer doing here? Extend the debate? 🙈 https://www.n-tv.de/21238851"
One would be enough for me.
A start
"He should apologize for only realizing this now. It is interesting that this view of the media in general and pirated radio in particular has now reached the CDU, FDP and the SPD and a number of journalists."
But is more for the left wing of the SPD.
There were uncomfortable decisions. He jumped off in time. And now PD and 5 * are pushing him up to 40% + x until the regular new elections. He bridges the time with victories in regional elections. Power tactically a smooth 1.
Which is a shame because the book has real strengths in the places and actually provides information that the AfD could understand.
The story should only please the journalist and have a &quot;coherent&quot; effect on him. You would have to lie a lot together for this. The best example is Ms. Schreiber. Almost all publicly discussed positions are fictitious. Very good atmospheric impressions fall down behind.
Another bright spot in the taz. https://twitter.com/tazgezwitscher/status/1166603821751132160…
"And that in Brussels, first and foremost FDP &amp; Friends"
"Yes, a foul after a dozen fouls by Brexit opponents. https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/1166653335899922433…"
Just ask him who was responsible for repeating the local election in his KV 2014. So because of intra-party democracy and so.
"Sure, but as long as the story is consistent for the journalist, it will be written to the truth. I don&#39;t have to let it go."
"I am truly the last to report good things about the AfD, but that&#39;s really a laugh."
One would then only have to take a critical look at the man himself. 🙈
"German economics is full of professors who know exactly how they should steer the economy so that everything becomes splendid. Far too few, on the other hand, mention the freedoms that entrepreneurs need so that it becomes mediocre again. #Sozialismusproblem"
Or also: Whoever defends everything defends nothing.
"Yes, that&#39;s all right with me."
The bad thing: At Senftleben it was absolutely superfluous. You knew beforehand that he was a leftist.

I experience it that people tell me very different essential achievements of the turn.
What would really help: Tax and levy covers instead of rent covers.
The only turning point is the absence of Honecker and Mielke.
"Not crazy at all, because the &quot;turning point&quot; was never discussed. What&#39;s this? What do the East Germans want? Schwups, integrated, all questions postponed. So everyone defines what turning means for themselves. Even Staai people can talk about turning today."
"I want chocolate ice cream for everyone. And as a first step, I ban freezers."

😱😱😱
The fight against the AfD is ultimately just a facade of the media in particular. There they are very happy with the pile in their current state. Green government participation becomes a necessity.
They even say it smoothly in the face. In Saxony we would even have majorities together with the CDU. Five MdL are enough. But that would of course be more dangerous in perspective than a proletarianized AfD.
Then someone else has to do it. But hope for the AfD is wasting time.
Guess why
We have left the dead end.
"Höcke will not be the chairman but the next parliamentary leader in the Bundestag, presumably without being a top candidate."

The AfD is lost to bourgeois people. The Union is more likely to reform than the AfD to reverse its path.
"Yes, language is not their strength, so it went wrong easily."

Read his book?
"Therefore they can stay a little longer, because Höcke can only take over after the next BTW."
But only the weak ...
"We will also lose parts of the population, but he does not go into details like."
"It stands for a &quot;new European spatial planning&quot;, a new &quot;popular religion&quot; that can include &quot;elements of Christianity&quot;, the creation of a political elite, anti-pluralism, leader state and much more, yes!"
This is the advantage if you can occupy the BVerfG yourself. Then a bullshit comes out.
Or you have read and understood Höcke&#39;s book.
Do they do that? Wasn&#39;t known to me At least fascism is openly and vehemently committed.

"By the way, Weidel had my wife&#39;s offer to make the top candidate with a third party. But she didn&#39;t want it. But with Gauland, yes. Why? Well, easy to guess."
"That was exactly the price she was not willing to pay. Cooperation with the grand piano. Meithen and Weidel chose the other way. Funnily enough, my wife and I are insulted for not doing so and quitting. It&#39;s a bit schizophrenic."
Mind you before the party congress.
Cologne was an attempt to at least generate thought. Did not work. My wife had voluntarily renounced the top candidate that Gauland wanted to do with her.
Everything was clear in Cologne long ago.
"In a way, that&#39;s true. But never in cooperation. What we did is make the vehicle strong. But we were shot down by the media, not primarily within the party. And that still suits many leftists today."

"The AfD has not been growing since 2016. We only see comparisons with results from 2014. Nationwide, the AfD has always stood at 15%, sometimes more or less, since mid-2016. But what happens is something else. Protest voters become regular voters. The anger continues to grow."

"The smart guy now knows that you have no idea about the balance of power in the AfD. 😉 End of the debate. Höcke is just an irrelevant marginal figure, blah."
"To be against it is not yet an idea for the afterwards. And yet, it can get worse! Read Höcke&#39;s book, read Kubitschek and keep in mind that Weidel, Meuthen, Gauland have also made the kowtags in Schnellroda a long time ago!"
"But Merkel ... And the SPD ... Yes, that was just never the claim; not until at least mid-2016."
I&#39;m just saying that Höcke is a Nazi and I could prove that at any time. Everything else is your assessment. We are still a comparatively free country.
We also get tribalism (Arabic). But Germanic tribalism is not my answer.
Höcke just wants it differently. National Socialist!
I&#39;m fighting that.

Don&#39;t need films. I wrote that in the initial tweet! I don&#39;t care! But do integration officers have to compare colored fish and shellfish with black skin?

Melanin under water ... ring the bell?
But that&#39;s not the point for me.
Hans Christian Andersen describes them.
"Disney wants Arielle to cast the mermaid with a black actress. Now Disney is a private company that is supposed to do what they think. But when government agencies secrete such groats, it is more difficult. #Melanin https://twitter.com/IntegrationBund/status/1146742688986873862…"
Locked out!
"I totally agree with you. In this state, the AfD doesn&#39;t need anybody."
Imagine that the AfD had ironed out the same mistake for BTW17 itself.
"Sorry, the same mistake was made for BTW17 and corrected there! This is not a conspiracy, but stupidity!"
"The same error, which was corrected for BTW 17 itself, now leads to the deletion of all candidates from list position 19. 🙈🙈🙈 https://twitter.com/Tagesspiegel/status/1147116498911211520…"
There is a complete settlement. It&#39;s funny how the AfD propaganda works.
So says the AfD. That is why we both do without a group chair. Totally logical! At least for AfD spinners.
"Well, why I left a certain party should be clear. But why differentiate?"
"And that says Par.130 Abs.2, Nr.2 StGB pic.twitter.com/f1DtjstCGm"
Interesting for the broadcasting station: Par. 130 Abs.2 Nr.2 StGB
Then you will have to touch up. Maybe just not gender sensitive?
"None of this is new! There are maybe a dozen stumbling blocks, everyone, really everyone, has been chewed through numerous times for years."
These are topics that we all had up and down at the AfD for years.
Is actually obvious for several reasons.
I never started at BTW.
"Yes, truth hurts."
"List chaos at the AfD. We cannot choose a country list, but you can easily trust us to save Germany. https://twitter.com/MarcusPretzell/status/1147072278368272384…"
"Everything included, several transcripts, shop stewards, four witnesses, two assemblies, different assembly leaders ..."
"The depiction of the list chaos of the AfD Saxony by the state returning officer has just taken almost half an hour. Mind you, only the factual description, which otherwise takes three minutes."
"At the same time, Höcke, for example, demanded an upper limit of -200,000."
"So, messengers of bad news were beheaded for less earlier."
"No, actually no room for interpretation. The photos are clear."
Honorable mention that you admit it that way. The problem is actually that there were sensible proposals in 2015. Unfortunately often overlaid by demos in Erfurt with completely crazy people and statements. So difficult to separate from the outside.

The whole thing was part of the so-called autumn campaign 2015.
"Of course, it does not say that if the application for asylum is successful, you should fly to Germany. But that is logical. And why the writer omits it may explain itself."

I realize. I&#39;m just annoyed by the erratic.

Of course nobody can guess that. Simply process the Böhmermann list and I will no longer bother you. As long as I use my freedom and write what and where I want.
They want that.
Council proposal for the President of Parliament! And we are concerned about democracy. #postdemokratisch
It all happens pretty quickly https://twitter.com/rponline/status/1146331492685176833…
"He is stable, I can report."
Merkel prevented Weidmann in particular with this shit deal. Weber was very shaky from the start. But this is more due to his course than Merkel. He had raised half the EVP against himself. You can&#39;t blame S&amp;D and ALDE for using it.
&quot;The Kindergarten&quot; just hits the nerve of at least 1/3 of the British who are not in the mood for &quot;Kindergarten teacher&quot; Barnier.
"In any case, that explains why politics is currently practicing religious arguments on all sides."
You have to be very desperate for Vestager. That would be dramatic for the EPP.
Rather Altmaier
"Do you hope that vdL will be rejected by Parliament and not become Commission President? Only it has to be one, probably also a German. I only say Peter Altmaier. N / A? How does that feel? Have you already purchased vdL devotional items and organized vdL support demos?"
"And if things go really well, Parliament will now reject vdL. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible."
More important: Lagarde !!!
"Say, the idea of von der Leyen is originally from Farage, right?"
For classification only: The EP has 14 (!) Vice Presidents! Anyone who has time is allowed to do so.
Power? Vice President? Not serious!
"Where different morals replace law, several powers will replace the state&#39;s monopoly on violence. That was exactly #Weimar"
"It makes little sense. So he likes black, poor Italian men? Or what is that supposed to tell us?"
This was originally what pic.twitter.com/pffi5s36Jr was about
"If he is smart, he prefers to leave such statements. Doesn&#39;t help his daughter in the process."
"Just so I understand it. Italy today comparable to the 3rd Reich? If so, you would have to agree. Then we should declare war on Italy now. Resist the beginnings!"
"&quot;Stupid&quot; is correct, but unfortunately belongs to &quot;hate and agitation&quot;. We&#39;ll have to take you into protective custody."

But he is not interested in the perpetrators.
Accountability for non-perpetrators? What would you say if someone in 1945 wanted to hold all fellow travelers in D accountable?
"No, medical care."
"Anyone who welcomes the violation of the law, the violation of a judgment of the ECHR, rejects the rule of law, no matter what he calls it."
Morality instead of law! Anyone who rejects the rule of law must also explain what happens to the mandatory monopoly on violence.
It doesn&#39;t matter because there are different moral codes. This leads to indissoluble questions of violence because the monopoly on violence depends on the rule of law.

Of course you are talking nonsense. In Tunisia you would have had everything.

"Ok, understand what you mean. The only thing left is socio-political not tolerant. Private schools with the left? Pure men&#39;s clubs with the left? Parental authority? Etc. The left and the conservatives don&#39;t take much care."
Your tweet is a perfect example of deliberate escalation. I rate the rest accordingly.
Not paying attention in logic?
What&#39;s wrong with that?
Take a look at his Progilhaeder. Missile ranges from Cuba to the United States. You don&#39;t really need to know more.
"Anyone who carries a profile of missile ranges from Cuba to the USA is, of course, the perfect figurehead of Antifa."
