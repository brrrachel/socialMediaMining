"@danielmack Not quite! The unicorn feeds with difficulty! By the way: If Grü Ju Hessen strays to B, an appointment at the KAmt is guaranteed!"
@felixno would be even nicer!
@ColoniumKoeln You are smart too! A Kölsch on it!
@jreichelt Sorry. You&#39;re right! They had brought a denial from the WH and that together with the alleged notification correctly.
@djstardustdm And whether !!!

I haven&#39;t seen @ victor5679 yet. Who all?
@RonSmallenburg @ Margit11 Many Dutch people just learn German &quot;automatically&quot; by watching German TV or German movies. Therefore.
@djhoffmanlaw I am too! But something like that!
@ walli5 Is the call ruined ... :-)
@mathieuvonrohr Sure!
"@ mathieuvonrohr However, nobody knows how many Germans tweet in Dutch because they like their neighbor!"
@mathieuvonrohr Indeed !!! :-)
"@djhoffmanlaw  Dont think so. In Germany Twitter is no privat Comm.-tool. For professional communication, english sometimes more usefull."

Another important step taken by the Greek parliament. Not yet a journey but a good departure anyhow.

Congratulations @ J- @ J_Dijsselbloem with your re-election as President of the Eurogroup! Your contribution to the solution was very clear
@mathieuvonrohr 2/2 The GreekPM honestly fighting for his countries place in Europe + the Chancellor: tough indeed but committed to solution
@mathieuvonrohr Nobody really knows. 1/2 I guess it´s a sense of unity + responsability whenever Europe seriously struggles for compromise
@mathieuvonrohr And to the better! :-)

@sven_giegold And that&#39;s exactly what the fund does: So that we have time! Tell me! :-)
@sven_giegold The wealthy will pay the fund good prices if they believe in return. Speaking of which: Tsipras seems to know that!
"@sven_giegold In the market economy, investments come from people who have money, want to earn more and pay taxes for it !!"
@sven_giegold Almost malevolent: the aim of the fund is to only privatize when the price is right!
@ Steinhagelvoll You could do it all the time: exchange suggested measures with others ...
@MichaelWKlein @m_fietz Exactly.
@ bundesautobahn7 Total.

@mathieuvonrohr committed to serious reforms to the sake of the country. His former MoF ....

".@mathieuvonrohr In 2003, facing economic disaster, Chancellor Schröder adopted Agenda 2010 to the sake of the country. His former 1/3"
". @ Augstein your mistake: it&#39;s not about &quot;enforcing&quot;. F, I, S, D have long agreed in principle (not always in detail)."

@HerzbuchWilf Thank you!
"@ saba1988 Sometimes you have to act instead of communicate. if it helps Greece get on its feet, it was even worth it."
Staying true to our line: “@ walli5: Greek crisis - #Merkel did everything right | Cicero Online http://www.cicero.de/berliner- Republic/greece-crisis-merkel-hat-alles-richtig-made/59556… #EU ”
@jreichelt It is all the more important that reality has arrived. In D it was also bad with red-green for 5 years. Then Wende came with Agenda 2010 ...
"I join: “@cdu_ol: #RIP Philipp Missfelder. Way too young, way too early. We are thinking of his family."
"@jreichelt That was already said when it came to Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus. Was wrong."
. @ ArLeparmentier And despite everything: The Franco-German - once again - was crucial in the search for a solution and a compromise!
"@jreichelt I live in Europe! I am proud that EVERYONE had the strength to find a good solution: EPP, SP, Liberals, Greens, True Finns and Syriza!"
Europe won. Impressive &amp; strong. D was part of the solution - from start to finish! Good for Greece and for the euro!
@ MerlinX9X @flueke @eurocrat you are right! We have been talking about this in the Eurogroup for years!
@petertauber Noah&#39;s at Wittenberg Platz. Nice in the sun and newspaper kiosk within reach! Also not far from @peteraltmaier :-)
