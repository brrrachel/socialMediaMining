Is moving! @kyriakidestella as designated #EU commissioner says that the report on #labeling will come in 2019 + she favors #Nutriscore. The European food movement can be proud of it after&gt; 15 years. @Ernaehrungsrat @ErnaehrungsratM @Die_Gruenen @foodwatch_de https://twitter.com/Perrin_Cam/status/1179107927078166528…

🤔 We will still have to help #Nutriscore. @The Greens will agree and hopefully all coalition partners will see it that way. Intermediate step for the fight for mandatory #EU # nutrition labeling
It will be sooo great: &quot;The city is eating itself up&quot;. #Berlin #FoodWeek https://twitter.com/EssPressBerlin/status/1178922797424402433…
That will be notified! Logo. And you can recommend it today so companies can prepare. Whoever is part of the problem must be ready for change. #Nutriscore

&quot;... the others&quot;
It can be assumed that they also underestimate the intelligence @akk @CDU. Difference between SPD in #Bt and #Bundesrat
