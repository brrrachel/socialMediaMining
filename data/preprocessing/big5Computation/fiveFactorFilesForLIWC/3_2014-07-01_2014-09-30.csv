Many greetings from # lf2014sb. I&#39;m at the stand of the Diakonisches Werk. Very loyal participants. Thank you very much for that!
"Cooperating means that, if possible, we dismantle double structures, generate synergy effects and bundle competencies."
Consolidating means that the country guarantees a financing framework. # stable finance # planning security
The result is a balanced compromise between scientific and state-political aspects = future-proof university system
Thanks to everyone who was involved with constructively critical comments or concepts / suggestions # saarländischerWeg
Our country will focus on its strengths. The Saarland path means goal-oriented cooperation with everyone involved.
"The state government, Saar economy and chambers work together to fight for the best and brightest minds."
Key points anything but a pure savings concept. They are strategic positioning to remain competitive in the long run.
Next step: Rapidly develop a comprehensive state university development plan based on the key points.
Foundation of saarl. University Center for Academic Continuing Education: Support in setting up / organizing continuing education courses
Establishment of a start-up semester analogous to the research semester to support spin-offs at universities
"Our goals for more cooperation and consolidation at universities apply equally to infrastructure, service and administration"
This broad base at the universities in the country is supplemented by our efficient institutes.
@Htw has a broad base in engineering and is the focus of future engineering. Higher education
The engineering training is reorganized taking into account the requirement profile of the Saarland economy # securing skilled workers
A key feature of the future university landscape will be cooperation platforms with a joint doctoral college.
Transplantation medicine and dentistry at the Saarland University Hospital (UKS) will remain.
We want to ensure the high performance of university medicine in the long term.
The state government is now expecting more intensive third-party funding and the training of the same number of students from law.
"Law remains the same, profile is sharpened. Link interdisciplinary legal informatics with IT security research."
Capacities Teacher training courses: Responsible handling of career expectations and life plans for young people.
Computer science and “NanoBioMed” are to be further expanded as focal points.
Result: Definition of a binding financial framework that gives our universities reliable planning security by 2020.
"The cornerstones of the state government and government factions are the result of a longer, intensively conducted and broad discussion process."
Part of our future security concept also includes readjustments within our university landscape.

State government expects stronger cooperation / bundling of all European-related activities at both universities = European profile building
Exhausting all efficiency reserves in administration comes before restricting services for students and scientists
The state government expects both universities to implement the concept by 2020.
I am glad that everyone involved has now returned from a certain &quot;worst case hysteria&quot; to the factual structural discussion.
The state government expressly attaches importance to the fact that the other compensation means are used with the involvement of the students.
"The main idea was, is and remains, the competitiveness of our universities. # saarländischerWeg"
Compliments to Neunkirchen for the musical project &quot;Steam&quot;. Great performance by all amateur actors and the entire team!
