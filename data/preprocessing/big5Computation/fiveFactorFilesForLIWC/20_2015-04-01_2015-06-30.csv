"@anachorete thank you, you found something positive :-)"
"@SchererDdorf No, more like a wake-up call"
We are still there. At the moment it&#39;s about #communal policy on the #linkebpt. Here in the stream: http://www.die-linke.de/mediathek/livestream/…
@me_til @pirate_slash Difficult question at such a late hour. Have you looked here: http://www.die-linke.de/partei/organe/parteitage/bielefelder-parteitag-2015/…
@LinksGelenken thanks
We say: Thank you! https://twitter.com/LinksGelenken/status/607267694329643008…
@StephanEwald We have a debate on #bge incl. Pro and contra. Follow it live here: http://www.die-linke.de/mediathek/livestream/… #LinkeBPT
Ralf Krämer: &quot;The #BGE involves tighter controls in tax law to raise a lot of money.&quot; #LinkeBPT
"Debate #bge &quot;BAG basic income financing concept does not work,&quot; says Ralf Krämer #LinkeBPT"
"&quot;People are fighting for concrete, enforceable goals and not for the #BGE. So it won&#39;t happen.&quot; #LinkeBPT"
Ralf Krämer&#39;s reply follows: &quot;I differ in the consequences of the #BGE.&quot; #LinkeBPT
&quot;The #BGE is about a human right to achieve the good life.&quot; #LinkeBPT
"&quot;#BGE is an instrument for democratizing, revolutionizing and revolutionizing the world of work.&quot; #LinkeBPT"
&quot;#BGE promotes liberation at work and liberation from work.&quot; #LinkeBPT
&quot;Basic income removes human labor from the arbitrariness of the market.&quot; #LinkeBPT #BGE
&quot;Basic income creates redistribution from top to bottom. 70% of the population benefit from it.&quot; #LinkeBPT #BGE
&quot;Financial markets are realized utopias of a few. #BGE is realized utopias of the many.&quot; #LinkeBPT
"&quot;#BGE is not a reward for laziness, since the workers have a much higher income. There is a wage gap.&quot; #LinkeBPT"
Now #live: debate on the #LinkeBPT on unconditional basic income. #bge http://www.die-linke.de/mediathek/livestream/…
&quot;#BGE does not depress wages. It is a permanent strike money&quot; #LinkeBPT
Stefan Wolf opens a basic income for the BAG: &quot;Every person receives an unconditional basic income.&quot; #LinkeBPT #BGE
@BetterCallAxel @LINKENeuenhagen @colonpolis There is a clear party management decision: http://www.die-linke.de/partei/organe/parteivorstand/parteivorstand-2014-2016/beschluesse/fuer-frieden-und-deeskalation-in -Of Ukraine/ …
The debate about an unconditional basic income begins with a short presentation by Stefan Wolf &amp; a counter by Ralf Krämer. #LinkeBPT
"It continues on the #LinkeBPT with a new day management: @Birke_Bull, Jutta Meyer-Siebert, Stefan Dreher and @klauslederer."
@Rentmeister_Fix Why? Has the knowledge of basic arithmetic worsened so badly with superiors since 1927? ;-)
@Dueseberg @LangLINKE I don&#39;t think you two are that far apart - and we see it similarly.

Gysi: &quot;We live in a political democracy. That is why we can only consider the nonviolent way of transformation.&quot; #linkebpt
"&quot;If we find the right level of criticism on the one hand and respect on the other, we are credible.&quot; @GregorGysi"
"&quot;We need a deeply critical relationship with state socialism, including the GDR.&quot; @GregorGysi #LinkeBPT"
&quot;We are now a significant political force in Germany. Who could have imagined that at the time?&quot; @GregorGysi #linkebpt
"&quot;Without Oskar Lafontaine, the whole thing would not have worked had I, by the way, also not returned to politics.&quot; @GregorGysi #LinkeBPT"
&quot;The fact that we managed to turn the party upside down and expand acceptance was an achievement that we can be proud of.&quot;
@larszimmerm Gysi emphasized that the party executive should not be burdened with personnel debates.
"&quot;When Heym opened the Bundestag in 1994, the CDU / CSU expressed their disregard for him, which only damaged them.&quot;"
". @ GregorGysi thanks all fellow campaigners, including Hans Modrow, Lothar Bisky, @DietmarBartsch, André Brie, Heinz Vietze. #LinkeBPT"

"The panel discussion with @b_riexinger, @katjakipping, Melina Klaus and Michael David follows. Moderation @Birke_Bull #bge #LinkeBPT"
"&quot;Our goal must be democratic socialism, not basic income. It is not the same thing.&quot; #bge #LinkeBPT"
"&quot;#BGE runs the risk of being misused as a combined wage, since every euro is important to people and they go into the combined wage&quot; #LinkeBPT"
&quot;The #BGE is based on gainful employment. The alternative would be liberation in the work and redistribution of the work volume.&quot; #LinkeBPT
We now wish our brave delegates a relaxing break. At 6.15 p.m. it continues with the #LinkeBPT.

Höhn: &quot;We want to redistribute wealth and invest in the future. We reject #TTIP and want to expand civil rights.&quot; #linkebpt
Höhn: &quot;I want us to talk louder about our successes in the communities and cities!&quot; #linkebpt
Kipping: &quot;There are two approaches to describing the state of Europe. The machinations of the EU elites or of people who defend themselves.&quot;
&quot;We also had very good results in HH and HB. In St. Pauli we even showed that we can also be the strongest party in the West.&quot;

Kipping: &quot;We are not humble when it comes to the future. We want to change the path to a socialist society!&quot;
"Kipping: We need shorter working hours! In view of technical progress, 20-30 hours a week would be perfectly sufficient."
We agree that we want sanction-free protection against poverty for all people and that #HartzIV should be abolished. #LinkeBPT
". @ katjakipping: &quot;The socialism we mean must be democratic, feminist, ecological and lustful.&quot; #LinkeBPT"
