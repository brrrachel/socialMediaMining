You are also welcome to comment here if you have an opinion on the topic. What solution do you have for the problem of insufficient living space? (TB)
"No. Too little living space can only be solved with MORE living space, no matter how you turn and turn. If you buy apartments, for example, the money for social housing is missing. (TB)"
"Yes, the state makes building more and more expensive. You can turn it around as you like: if there are not enough apartments, you have to build additional apartments. You won&#39;t get the money for this if you buy existing apartments as a state. Brings no new living space. (TB)"
It&#39;s about someone building at all. Too few apartments are too few apartments. You won&#39;t get the problem of too few apartments out of the question with rental price brakes. There is still too little living space. Only then nobody builds anymore. Team Beer
