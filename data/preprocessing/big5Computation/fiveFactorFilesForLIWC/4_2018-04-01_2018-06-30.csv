"Angela #Merkel after today&#39;s committee meetings: After the European Council, we will discuss the results of the negotiations in the CDU Presidium and Federal Executive Committee on July 1st, 2018 and decide on the further procedure in the light of what has been achieved."
These negotiations are a big challenge. We need a federal government capable of acting and a head of government with a strong negotiating mandate. The joint work of the CDU / CSU guarantees this.
"Angela #Merkel: The # CDU federal executive supported me with a strong mandate, so I want to do this in the environment of the EU Council on 28/29. Negotiate bilateral agreements with European partners in June."
"Uncoordinated rejections at our borders as a country in the heart of Europe could lead to negative domino effects at the expense of Germany and ultimately to the questioning of the European integration work, for which we as #CDU have always stood and continue to stand. #Europe"
"Furthermore, it is in Germany&#39;s interest to arrange and manage #migration in good partnership with our European neighbors."
This also corresponds to the fact that in the future we will not allow those refugees who have been returned to the country in which they were first registered in accordance with the # Dublin regulation in agreement with the country concerned.
"In everything we do, we have to represent German and European interests together. That is why we do not want to act unilaterally, not without consultation and not at the expense of third parties. #Europe"
"We support the initiative of the Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, to additionally submit a master plan for migration. @BMI_Bund @CSU"
We enforced our common set of rules for migration between the CDU and CSU in the coalition agreement. We have thus created a good basis on which the Chancellor and the federal government she leads can work on these goals. https://www.cdu.de/artikel/regelwerk-zur-migration‚Ä¶
We are guided by the fact that the CDU and CSU stand for internal and external security. We have already achieved a lot in this way.
