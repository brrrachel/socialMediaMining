Thank you for &quot;listening&quot; when you have &quot;listened&quot;. :-) &quot;twitter hour&quot; is over. Who cares: at #EUCO you can follow what&#39;s going on.
Another difference between van-Rompuy and EP: # Tyssen report calls for numerous measures for the democratic control of economic governance.
Van Rompuy does not propose any social policy measures to counter the effects of the crisis. EP already: eg employment guarantee for young people.
Van Rompuy paper ignores the # EU 2020 targets. EP demands that they become binding. @MartinSchulz should have said that! #QualitativWax
"By the way, Van- # Rompuy paper completely ignores the fight against #tax dumping. in the # Thyssen report of the #EP this is made the subject."
Interesting to follow @MartinSchulz. He wants &quot;turn measures 4 growth in2 reality&quot;. Social democracy was already there. What wax?

"@JohnSturges ME, there could only be a comparable interference in the budgetary law of the parliaments if the EP can say NO to this."

"In my opinion, @JohnSturges Schäuble super commissioner doesn&#39;t have a chance, because France doesn&#39;t want that. See #Hollande in Le Monde."
@Marzipan_Likoer There is also a difference whether my Bundestag or my Assemblee Nationale makes this decision or 1 commissioner.
