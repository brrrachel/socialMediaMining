"At the Castor demo in front of the # CSU headquarters, there were more media representatives than demonstrators. # Green http://t.co/QT4aKj7DTO"
The # Greens completely ignore the reality of life of the people in #Bavaria.
RT @CSU: It is necessary and correct that at least #Bayern consistently extends the search for veils.
"RT @CSU: In view of the search results at the # G7 summit, SPD behavior is irresponsible. #Veil search http://t.co/tJ…"
Was with child reporter Maja for the summer interview from logo! traveling in #Passau. It was fun! http://t.co/7ihPFP4Bdf
I wish my General Secretary colleague @petertauber and his @CDU a happy 70th birthday. # 70years CDU https://t.co/XKahwGcud2
The SPD gets its memo for not representing Bavarian interests. #Bavaria #CSU
The encouraging figures from the new # Bayern survey give us a tailwind to restlessly pursue our political line.
Great numbers for @CSU in the new # Bayern survey. # lion-strong http://t.co/hhjg9avi10
"If you don&#39;t act, you will shrug your society."
These include reception centers for refugees in #North Africa or # visa requirements for #Balkan countries.
"#Asylum Summit has decided important measures, but these are not enough. Bavarian government has concept for tougher measures."
A new visa requirement for the Balkans would help to limit the influx. #Asylum # Refugees
60% are economic refugees (rejection rate over 99%). Therefore: #Kosovo #Albania #Montenegro classify as safe countries of origin!
Around 60 million people are currently displaced. The #EU must fight the causes of flight. #Asylum # Refugees
It is the fault of the EU that justice has to be postponed on Germany&#39;s streets. #Toll
"They behave like fax makers in the last bank in the classroom, where advancement is at risk. # Euro https://t.co/kWhQDIgO4E"
RT @CSU: The Greek government has obviously not yet grasped the seriousness of the situation. #Euro
"#SPD&#39;s criticism is completely wrong. In doing so, #SPD exposes itself as a party that doesn&#39;t care about jobs and wants to snoop around in private."
It would be a disaster if #inheritance tax means that heirs cannot continue to run businesses and jobs are therefore lost.
#CSU will not go through #inheritance tax reform that falls behind the revised Finance Minister bill.
"We must not only better manage the more asylum seekers, we also have to tackle the less influx!"
We have to make a clear distinction between real # war refugees we want to help and mere # economic refugees.
"We need to go beyond the symptoms to the causes, and we need answers on how we can fundamentally reduce the flow of refugees."
The # Refugee Summit shouldn&#39;t just be about financial issues and fairer distribution of refugees.
Today you also have the opportunity to visit # Bundeswehr locations throughout Germany. More information here: http://t.co/fHC5g8ue97 # TdBW15
Today is the day of the #Bundeswehr - a good opportunity to thank our soldiers for their commitment to our country. # TdBW15
Today meeting of the general secretaries and federal managing directors on the topic of increasing the turnout. http://t.co/VzQngNGHRg
"If # EU officials don&#39;t allow significantly more border controls, they become accomplices of smugglers and traffickers."

"Tradition and progress, touchpad and traditional costumes make up Bavaria&#39;s recipe for success - but for the SPD it&#39;s all just fantasy."
#Bayern is a global brand and number 1 in Germany.
Secretary-General #Fahimi&#39;s comments on the # G7 summit are just small and embarrassing.
SPD general secretary #Fahimi said too much &quot;Disneyland&quot; was presented at the # G7 summit.
Many thanks to the many thousands of police officers and emergency services! You ensured that the # G7 summit went off peacefully.
"Chaos, violence and riot have no chance with us. #Bayern # G7 https://t.co/B3oPK5uaAg"
"We don&#39;t need a Hätschel-Tätschel-Juncker, but a stable #Euro."
Our announcement is clear: help only against reforms. It is the only language that the Greek government understands. #Euro
#Juncker implies that #Greece wants to donate billions more. That is the completely wrong signal. #Euro
"Instead of interfering in national responsibilities, #EU should focus on its mega-issues of a stable euro and refugee policy."
It must be over with the idea of the EU that Germany will make everything available free of charge and the others will use it with us
"EU has been advising user financing for years. If it is then done, the EU Commission would like to play the higher legislator. #Toll"
The #EU&#39;s approach is absolutely unacceptable. Mr. Juncker probably doesn&#39;t have a clear view. #Toll

"Excessive gender equality policy! University Equal Opportunity Officer finds window degraded women as objects ... Oh yes, oh yes! #Fensterlgate"
We need a mandatory arbitration procedure in the future! # Railway strike #GDL
Strikes by individual unions must not completely paralyze public life in Germany. #GDL # train strike
Germany cannot accept as many refugees as 23 other member states combined. #EU
#CSU therefore welcomes the # EU Commission&#39;s proposal for binding refugee quotas.
"We not only need to limit the influx of refugees, we also need better distribution across #Europe."
RT @CSU: Relief with #ColdProgression + increase #child benefit. Also on the agenda: # State financial equalization #Soli #startups # Building renovation…
@CSU ensures more justice on German roads and more money for the transport infrastructure. #Toll
The #Toll is coming! The following applies to our election promise: promised - kept.
# Refugee Summit: Tomorrow it will have to be given concrete advice on how we can limit refugee flows.
Need progress in the fair distribution of refugees &amp; relief for countries and municipalities. #Fluechtlingsgipfel
#SPD stands out in discussions about #BND due to bad style. This does not bring factual information a millimeter further.
