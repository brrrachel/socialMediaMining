"Call of @Nicht_Mit_Uns_ signed. After victims and their families, one group in particular suffers from terrorist attacks: Muslims."
"30 years ago, Reagan shouted, &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.&quot; I call to his successor: &quot;Mr. Trump, don&#39;t even build that wall.&quot;"
"I am happy for @EmmanuelMacron. To reform Europe, it needs a majority - and also a new government in Germany."
We have unanimously decided on an election program that can improve the lives of everyone in our country. This is step 1.
Gerhard Schröder&#39;s no to the Iraq war was a proud hour in this country. My no is Donald Trump&#39;s armament craze.
"I&#39;m happy about the good result for @EmmanuelMacron. To reform Europe, we need change in Germany in September!"
"State Party Congress in Duisburg: Nobody here understands why the Union does not present a pension concept. In any case, we have clear solutions!"
"Whoever makes politics a game loses. According to Cameron, May now knows that too. Hope the UK-EU negotiations are not getting any more difficult now."
Today we are laying the foundation for the election campaign and our government work: We are adopting an election program that deserves its name.
"At the end of Ramadan, I wish all Muslims a nice and blessing sugar festival. :)"
Tomorrow we will end our election program. It doesn&#39;t say what colors the posters are. But clear announcements and realistic solutions.
Just talked to Jeremy Corbyn on the phone. We agreed to meet very soon.

"I invited international start-ups to come to D at the NOAH digital conference. Here is the place of creativity, culture &amp; tolerance."
What a catch up! Congratulations to @jeremycorbyn and @UKLabour!

"Unlike the Union, I clearly rule out an increase in the retirement age."

"Nowadays, skilled workers have to pay the top tax rate. We change that and relieve those who need it."
"Nice that the CDU boss has changed her mind about tax research funding. With me there are immediately, not at some point."
There is an alternative to Europe. But we already know that. It is the Europe of dictatorships and murder from the previous century.
My thoughts are with the victims of the cowardly attacks in London and with their families. We stand together with our British friends.
Tax concept presented today: We provide targeted relief - families and people with low incomes. It is a question of justice!

My thoughts are with the victims of the cowardly attacks in London and their families. Stand by our British friends.
Trump makes the principle of deliberately breaking taboos a means of his policy. That connects him with Erdoğan and Orbán.

#just if everyone can marry. Legal Committee has just voted for marriage for all. Now the Bundestag has to decide. Forward!
"You can get out of a climate deal, but you can&#39;t get out of climate change, Mr. Trump. Reality is not a statesman to be pushed away."

Today it applies: 1. Go vote: We don&#39;t need right-wing agitators in Parliament. 2. Choose SPD: @HanneloreKraft is the best candidate. #ltwnrw
Who should rule NRW? Our prime minister @HanneloreKraft or former CDU minister who overslept childcare? That&#39;s what it&#39;s about.
Saturday morning and the SPD is on its feet all over NRW and is wholeheartedly involved. I&#39;m proud of you. Give everything!

It is bitter that science freedom must now be demonstrated. It&#39;s a good thing there are so many. Worldwide. #marchforscience
"At the weekend: demo against the AfD federal party conference, March of Science, Pulse of Europe, French election For Democrats it&#39;s time to fly the flag!"
A fairer society is also the more resilient. It is not so sensitive to the messages of the agitators and seducers.
The short outcome of the referendum shows: Erdoğan is not Turkey. Commitment to democracy and human rights must continue.
I wish you and your loved ones a wonderful Easter! My sincere thanks to those who work for us today
War used to be the rule in Europe. My generation doesn&#39;t know that anymore. But what about those who come after us? It is up to us.

In SH you have five hours left. Here you can choose for the first time from 16. So grab friends and acquaintances and choose SPD!
France deserves a president who will not divide this magnificent country but will give it a future. So give your voices to @EmmanuelMacron!
In SH it is now in your hands: vote to keep the right-wing agitators out of parliament. SPD vote for Torsten Albig!
"Strong, how you give everything in SH! Address friends and acquaintances again so that Torsten Albig can make the country even more fair and modern."
Only with Torsten Albig will there be free childcare in SH. That&#39;s why I&#39;m currently in the north &amp; fight for the election victory with him.
