Elected today as SPD group leader SH. 80% good result. Meet journalists who want to see heads roll or write them down!
"Too bad and thank you very much for the great election campaign to all the committed campaigners on the Kuhberg, in the Kampa, bus and in all constituencies!"
Still bad election result and fundamental debate necessary. Black and yellow majority in SH means committed opposition for SPD!
"After a dramatic election result, serious discussion in the Praesidium + party executive.InSH black and yellow has no majority 1.7% less!"

I have to thank. @shz_de #ltwsh
I agree with the SPD that I am promoting. And I prefer the competition from the Greens and SSW. @shz_de #ltwsh
How suspicious that the competition is watching. And how much that is even a media topic. @shz_de #ltwsh
should be interested. At least that&#39;s how I know it from Björn Engholm and Heide Simonis. @ Shz_de #ltwsh
Could be that there is less time for it. Since an MP from mine take care of the problems of the country and for politics

@DennisGladiator Nonsense: Atomic law very operator-friendly Enforcement SH very strict thanks to the SPD Minister! Only a consequent nuclear phase-out helps!
"@iSchack They want profits from nuclear power from the depreciated old piles and not the energy transition, decentralized decisions or even savings!"
"@iSchack If networks do not come into public hands, for example municipal property, corporations block decentralized and renewable energy."
"Population is rocked, if only words against nuclear companies! Irreversibly accelerate nuclear phase-out and networks in public. Hand!"
"(2) only by yes to nuclear consensus and consistent energy turnaround! Old nuclear power plants quickly off the grid, energy saving, efficiency, right of way for renewables!"
I&#39;m always amazed at tri-tra-trullala understanding of politics in interviews with the competition. Nuclear exit instead of pithy words (1)
@dieGoerelebt one should ask the black and yellow atom fans!

Kiel&#39;s crime scene in Maritim is shrill and that with Twitter guests. &quot;Twitter Murder&quot; would be a good title ?!
That with the wine is obviously a passion of its own kind (see SPIEGEL of tomorrow).
My visit to Schierensee including wine and the subsequent press report about it is probably forgotten or the opposite fits better into the picture.
