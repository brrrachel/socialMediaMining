"Social democracy is bigger than the individual. If I contribute to the renewal of the SPD with my resignation, it was worth it. I look back on a year full of ups and downs. And look to the future of our party with confidence. I say to you from the bottom of my heart: thank you. pic.twitter.com/q4luTDGZ4J"
I will not join the federal government and hope that this will end the personal debates within the SPD. We all make politics for the people of this country. Part of this is that my personal ambitions are behind the interests of the party.
"After tough and successful negotiations, I wrote down my thoughts on the current situation on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/martinschulz/posts/10155650912113462…"
"We have negotiated a coalition agreement that improves our schools, makes our jobs more reliable, safeguards us in old age and strengthens our Europe. We have achieved a lot for people. That&#39;s what it&#39;s about and that&#39;s why I&#39;m going to promote this contract."
"Together we want to put Europe at the forefront of government action. The willingness is finally there with the other parties. We now have a real opportunity to improve Europe in this sense, and we should take this opportunity. https://twitter.com/spdde/status/960540059555557377…"
"On the sidelines of the coalition talks, I just exchanged ideas with @PulseofEurope about future prospects for Europe. We need more trust in the EU again. To do this, civil society and politics must pull together. Now is the time to move Europe forward! pic.twitter.com/kYobTg833B"
"A strong Europe must be one of the main concerns of a future government. I agree with the chairmen of CDU &amp; CSU. We want a new start in Europe. The goal: local solutions to local problems, but European answers to global challenges."

. @ ABaerbock and @RobertHabeck are the new leaders of the Greens. I congratulate warmly and look forward to a good cooperation!
Commemorating the Holocaust victim also obliges us to resolutely fight any anti-Semitism of our time - and it is getting louder again. For social democracy this is an innermost obligation. No more anti-Semitism again! Never again fascism! #WeRemember
Together we want to make people&#39;s lives better in the country and in Europe. This is my team for the coalition negotiations: pic.twitter.com/LFV1r1Tv3k
"In view of the isolationism of the United States and the authoritarianism of China, we need a strong Europe and for that a solid and lively Franco-German friendship. Today, we are celebrating the 55th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty - long live Franco-German friendship!"
"In a world with isolationist America and authoritarian China, we need a strong Europe. And a strong Europe needs a stable and lively Franco-German friendship. Today we celebrate 55 years of the Élysée Treaty - vive l&#39;amitié franco-allemande!"
The result for me is: a vote of confidence from those who voted for coalition negotiations. And an obligation to fight for everyone who voted against. Thanks for the fair debate. Let us now improve the lives of people in the country in concrete terms.
"Other parties are masters in speaking. We are masters in design. So that we can design, we have to vote yes today. Let&#39;s do it for the people for whom we can make a difference."
"Today is one of the days when a lot is at stake for the SPD, our country and Europe. I trust our delegates and wish us a fair debate. The better arguments should prevail."
"Prepare for my speech. I don&#39;t want to persuade anyone tomorrow, I want to convince. Free daycare centers, a strong Europe and decent care - that is only possible if we rule. The chance to be able to help many people noticeably is a duty for me. pic.twitter.com/GDsUtDqylC"
"Tomorrow we will also vote on the future of Europe. I am fighting for our party conference to send a clear signal: responsibility for Europe. @Henrikenderlein also sees it that way, who wrote a brilliant article: http://spon.de/ae9pr"
Trump has been in office for a year. Only our American friends can vote him out. We can counter him and the other agitators with the largest democratic community in the world: Europe. But Europe only gets stronger with the SPD.
"No matter what others say, there are no &quot;dwarves&quot; or &quot;milk faces&quot; in our party. I see great and responsible democrats in our ranks in this debate. I&#39;m really proud of that. Thank you all for that!"
"We don&#39;t have an absolute majority. And the right to think about our party. But we have also enforced demands against the CDU and CSU that will make life noticeably easier for many people. We should do just that, I promote it."
"All individual unions of the DGB are for coalition negotiations. DGB chief Reiner Hoffmann could just tell me that. &quot;Negotiate and see that you get more out of it,&quot; he told me and that&#39;s exactly what I want to do."
At 12 p.m. I will answer your questions about the exploratory results live on Facebook. Feel free to ask the questions here. Looking forward to see you soon!
"My spokesman @TobiasDuenow leaves after 21.1. the Willy-Brandt-Haus, where he gave everything for his SPD for many years. I thank him with all my heart for the excellent, passionate, sacrificing work, for his humor, his ingenuity and his loyalty."
