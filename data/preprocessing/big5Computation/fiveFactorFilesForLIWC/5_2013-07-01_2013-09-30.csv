@webwombel The numbers in the Tagesspiegel are not correct. Even @DIW_Berlin and @handelsblatt later confirmed SPD figures
"@WilhelmRoepke From your point of view, how should I react to your general verdict &quot;Members do what they want&quot;?"
@webwombel What do you mean exactly?

@neuthfer humbug? spun? Etc. I can tell you don&#39;t want a dialogue. Bye!
@neuthfer Your choice of words is irritating: So climate protection is not environmental protection?
"@neuthfer That&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s about. Limited commons cannot be used indefinitely: atmosphere, water, fish stocks etc."
@neuthfer So everyone should be allowed to emit heavy metals and sulfur oxides and CFCs at their own discretion? Toll-free?
"Environmental politicians that I will miss very much in the Bundestag: @Hermann_Ott and @HJFell. Stay tuned, we need you right now"
@neuthfer Please answer my question: What should the use of shared atmosphere be like with regard to all kinds of pollutants?
@neuthfer atmosphere is common good. What do you think usage should look like?
@neuthfer What&#39;s that all about? What is planned economy when you can no longer discharge exhaust gases in the atmosphere for free and without limits?
"The SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, which has grown by 46 seats, has 86 new members. They are introducing themselves at the parliamentary group meeting"

"Schäuble likes to do an OECD comparison? #Factscheck: In an OECD comparison in D, especially little educational expenditure and especially a lot of low wages"
"Schäuble: Collective partners should regulate minimum wages! #Factscheck: There are wages of 4.31 euros, the rest is paid by the community"
"Interesting: In the federal government, Schwarzgelb insists on a comparison with the financial planning 2010, in NRW she refuses, because they wanted three times more debt"

"@ jolicoeur11 Yes, of course the BND is listening, that is part of its known tasks. Only in Germany and with Germans, he is not allowed to do that"
@ jolicoeur11 But sharing your own knowledge / results is something completely different than delivering the raw data unprotected

@peteraltmaier Interesting that the Greens are telling something completely different. Against you are smoke candles antpups @pv_forum @longofl
@peteraltmaier This is the weakest thing I&#39;ve heard from you. EU-Kom. Oettinger has made it clear that he requires criteria @ longofl
"@pv_forum @peteraltmaier hides behind differences of opinion in the SPD, but does not mention the same problems in the government"
"@pv_forum Yes, that&#39;s what it&#39;s about! But @peteraltmaier shouldn&#39;t just say: &quot;The industry doesn&#39;t&quot;. Every dish gets that"
"@peteraltmaier It is only about criteria (!) such as trade intensity, energy intensity, total value creation etc. @pv_forum"
@peteraltmaier I support this with the coal out of EEG discount. But you have to propose law with criteria (!) @Pv_forum
"@peteraltmaier nonsense. Your suggestions weren&#39;t by criteria, but by industry. Not compliant with EU law! cc @pv_forum"

@euwidenergie The electricity distributors have to compensate for the fluctuating feed-in. Demand side management also gets a price boost
". @ pv_forum Under Röttgen and @peteraltmaier, the EEG surcharge increases three times faster than the total EEG remuneration. That is the mistake!"
@nuemax Somehow I can&#39;t find an argument in your tweet :-)
@JosefKanders As a CDU member you ask for things that have long been clear for party political reasons
Germany has given refuge to many defectors since 1949 without resorting to the Asylum Act. Why not #Snowden?
There were probably some poodles on the way http://m.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/a-909146.html#spRedirectedFrom=www&amp;referrrer= http://t.co/54x9zEj7Pu…
@ uncover007 Very little
"@HeHoffmann You don&#39;t have to either, Wiefelspütz stops. I was very angry about his statement!"
The Wikipedia article on Alexey Leonov. How impressive! http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Archipowitsch_Leonow…
"Group picture and conversation with the Atsronauts. Among them Alexey Leonov, who was the first to have an outdoor mission in space in 1965"
"Group picture and conversation with the astronauts. Among them Alexey Leonov, the first outside nine in 1965"
"On the way to the &quot;German Aerospace Center&quot; in Bonn, meeting with 80 astronauts. I&#39;m happy like a little child :-)"
Would the federal government also deny asylum seekers to a Chinese defector?

@andreas_lenz And what did Wilhelm II know?

@Flodefi @Groote We didn&#39;t say the opposite. But is that really the category they think in?
"@Flodefi The current system was introduced in 2009 and fails: Renewable income + 100%, but EEG surcharge + 500% cc @groote"
