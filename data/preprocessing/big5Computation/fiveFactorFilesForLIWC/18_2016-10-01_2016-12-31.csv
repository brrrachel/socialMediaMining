Selfie with Wonja from &quot;Bandwidth&quot; - taz titled as &quot;right greasy journalism&quot;. Friend-enemy determination in parts of @dieLinke obscure
Why were traces in the right-wing scene ignored and people with Turkish names suspected? #nsu #fallpeggy http://mobil.n-tv.de/politik/Bericht-Neonazis-schrieben-Peggys-Mutter-article18868696.htmlâ€¦

What is still needed in view of the questions in the Peggy and #NSU murder case: a new committee of inquiry in Bavaria. @Roter_Ritter
That is exactly what I meant by asking for personal / methodological agreement at Soko Peggy and Soko Bosporus. Thanks for the text #nsu https://twitter.com/patrickgensing/status/786789821591134208â€¦
"Neo-Nazis from Thuringian Homeland Security, especially in East Thuringia, involved in prostitution, human trafficking, child abuse"
"Clarify personnel and methodological overlaps or possible errors in the Soko Peggy, Soko Bosporus and BAO Trio / 3 investigations"
Acquisition of files from the area of forced child prostitution / child ponography with the participation of Thuringian / Saxon neo-Nazis through UAs / 2
Oh! The # NSU-UA NRW takes on the faction with the President of the BfV. OK then! https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/Pressemitteilungen-Informationen-Aufmacher/Pressemitteilungen-Informationen/Pressemitteilungen/2016/10/1010_PUA_NSU_BfV.jspâ€¦

Now with expert opinion: Clear separation of domestic / foreign Internet communication from the BND&#39;s unrealistic construct. https://netzpolitik.org/2016/bnd-kann-internetverkehr-nicht-zuverlaessig-nach-in-und-ausland-filtern-und-verstoesst-so- Gegen-gesetze/â€¦
Wasn&#39;t the deletion moratorium from #NSUBT valid in 2015? No &quot;historical interest&quot;? Looks like intent. Sorry Brandenburg. https://twitter.com/ndaktuell/status/783529676480348160â€¦
"That&#39;s right. Evidence suppression, criminal fraud and acts of support by authorities in the # NSU complex should be seen. https://twitter.com/welt/status/783535171735789568â€¦"

Apparently the BReg did not tell the truth when answering my small request (BT-Drs 18/1028) about Krause and traces. #NSU https://twitter.com/spiegel_top/status/809647853865959424â€¦
"There is still a lot to be said about the supposed homeless Krause, for example that there were &quot;enemy lists&quot; in depots. http://m.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/a-1126122.htmlâ€¦ #NSU"
I say nothing all day against #Saxony. Colleague @MdbWendt has stollen baked by grandmother for #NSAUA and it is mega delicious
there it is. Mr. Akmann says goodbye to #NSAUA today. I like to accept (-;
