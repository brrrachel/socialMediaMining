"@digiges @iRightsinfo @vzbv I am sure I will no longer be the author-Pope, because as 1st PGF there is unfortunately everything. But happy to help you knot the threads"
"@mrtopf @presroi PMs are not my thing anyway. On-line BS great for a specific topic. Think about it for a while, need a few more days"
"@presroi is also a learning process. Whoever makes originator can only see it from one side, the user from the other. Must bring both together."
@codeispoetry Great idea. Wouldn&#39;t have figured it out. Shows what else you have to learn ...
@Volker_Beck Ditto.
"@presroi Of course referred to Sigi Kauder, but the community is currently &quot;restricting&quot; him ..."
"@thorstensterk Twittering is like discovering a new planet. Not harmless, but exciting!"
@kbojens Anyone who surfs the Internet from + on doesn&#39;t understand anything about the Internet. But they don&#39;t know that ...
@R_Rainer Sometimes I try: being nice is kind of fun and politics is not always fun.
"@ heump13 Because they only spoke for themselves (not even for the other &quot;rebels&quot;). That was wrong: 68 Greens were + only had 13 minutes,"
@thewesm Yesterday&#39;s job is still in the bones! Now hope for more objectivity.
@helianthusiasm Already happened!
@JRehborn Joined the black and green pizza connection in 1996. You don&#39;t have to be united in everything to understand each other.
"@Roederschjoerg Thank you. I&#39;m happy about every nice tweet on Friday morning. Week was hairy, but Europe kept our fingers crossed for us because of the euro."
@ Feprivat also do not know where they all come from. The network is really exciting!
@Stecki The @stecki tweets are also very original. I also like burgers.
"@KlarerVerstand Hotels was not awesome. But politicians must do unpopulaires if they are convinced that they are correct. In the end, voters decide"
@padmodi Bet for Euro always worth it! The Netherlands and Germany have benefited enormously from the Euro
"@whitecorsair Politicians are just children, but Volker wanted to play. Debate was okay. The pole of development is bone work."
@BjoernBeck @Volker_Beck @herrurbach @Stecki Thanks for the many #FF. I hope I can always answer.
"@ heump13 Sure, rebels are always allowed to talk: there is short intervention (5min) + explanation of vote."
"@Volker_Beck the green banks are also pretty empty. Chancellor, incidentally, in Poland. Also important"
@ostpirat Always this social control! Big brother is waching you. Sorry but had to tweet first. Now put it away
@Volker_Beck I agree with volker beck u jorg van essen: the president is probably wrong here.
@ChristianHirte Very impressive how Christian struggled with himself for the right position. Congratulations + thank you
@vieuxrenard It is the case that the GG even limits the scope. at some point the BVerfG will proclaim the basic right to network access.
@JoernPL You have to start. And Sigi Kauder was never the Union&#39;s opinion: see coalition agreement
@Volker_Beck @michamo My friend Volker: The GG gives a lot and I want the network to develop freely and be accessible to everyone.
"@ aotto1968_2 Conversely: I would be willing to offer a lot as a price, but only serious of course."
"@michamo As promised: Fight for CDU + others to recognize how incredibly important the network has become. Security is a must, but according to the Basic Law"
"@anbusch Yes, and the world is keeping its fingers crossed. Thank you."
@Mulukukku There is always time for Europe: the test of our generation. What we screw up now we will not build up in years.
@schreyegg Again agreed. Most do not know how big the danger for Europe is.
@PSchnieder at least 1 faithful!
"@schreyegg Agree 100%, but domestic and foreign press have been speculating for days on whether chancellor majority will be reached. I think curd cheese."
@Mulukukku Unfortunately I can&#39;t serve with that. Head up: will be fine.
@ Wildrose211 &quot;look&quot; is said in northern Germany and - although Saarlanders - I find it sharper + better than the somewhat chaste &quot;look&quot;.
"@thewesm Thank you, luck is needed, but it is rare in these times."
@netzlab Agree: Financial market transaction tax must come as soon as possible. EU Commission should hurry up with a proposal.
"@Hynkl Thanks, the saying built me up :)"
Talked to Sigi Kauder today. He knows that his proposal is purely personal and not a CDU / CSU position. Thanks to @petertauber + @DoroBaer
"@Tannador With EFSF law (Do) we can prevent wildfire in the event of bankruptcy. ESM package regulates bankruptcy, but still has to be approved"
Euro: Can not explain everything in 140 characters. But really important. Urgently need a blog. Broad majority in the Bundestag was great ..
@Dandii Thanks to everyone for prompt explanation: #ff I have now understood. The Verified Profile has to explain @quarkmitsauce to my people.
"@twittycmf I always see Volker Beck. So if I react to user tweets, I hear something new. Unfortunately, often takes a long time because it is very busy."
"@Volker_Beck Maybe we should just have a good debate about the development pole, games with hammel jump bring nothing"
Sorry for 1 day off. Missed you. Thanks for FFs - do not know yet what that is but definitely good. More to come on strikes and euros
"@Volker_Beck With math, volker doesn&#39;t have it right now. Cdu better manned. But really: I&#39;m proud that the development pole is cross-party #bt"
@schreyegg give me trouble. But we need at least 311 MPs from us. Hope that Greens and SPD are also numerous. Would be a strong signal!
"Unfortunately, hardly any time for Twitter today: Must toil in BT for Euro vote. Need your own majority. Half the world is watching us tomorrow."
@michamo Sorry did not know the second tweet yet. Thank you and I&#39;ll get back to you in the evening. Now I have to go to parliament.
@michamo You know the GDR badly! And us too. Thank God!
@telepolis_news We are not the GDR! Kauder recognized across parties. It is only wrong with strikes.
@Volker_Beck just no stress that was at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe. Buroversehen
@ gr4y beck u oppermann make it out among themselves. Believe that all democratic parties can coalition with each other.
"@Volker_Beck @thomasoppermann Actually you all like to play with us, only your voters shouldn&#39;t know :)"
"@ChristianHirte No, really not. Professorship exciting, but without practical value for the decision that is due"
@SvenVolmering Lamenting doesn&#39;t help either.
"@HorstNRW Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m a CDU through and through. But each party misses something. The main thing is that she wakes up again."
@Wernermuende learning is not prohibited! In addition: network access is becoming increasingly important because the Internet is developing exponentially.
@ jimraynor99 Greetings to my old university! how about @NadineSchoen?
"@falky CDU for copyright but blocking completely wrong. Network access more important to me than Tel / TV, almost a staple: High legal good!"
@ingoj That&#39;s why I made it clear for the whole group.
Euro rescue is only gradual. Otherwise there is no incentive for self-help. See Berlusconi: promise everything in an emergency and then keep nothing
@ingoj This is politics: everyone can say everything and many do it too. Was amazed at the damage in the network. Therefore yesterday emergency brake. Sorry
Talked to Sigi Kauder today. He knows that his proposal is purely personal and not a CDU / CSU position. Thanks to @petertauber + @DoroBaer
"@Schmidtlepp Tip for pirates: You can also buy company bikes (from diets), cycling is even more fun!"
"Papandreou today in Berlin, the Netherlands EU ministers yesterday. Must not allow the EURO to sink, damage for D and EU would be far too great"
@vertigonix @petertauber is a good one! New (2009) + lively + indispensable as CDU network. I ask him when I&#39;m ´lost in space´.
@Volker_Beck @ThomasOppermann This is real political quark from SPD and Greens. Since the @Schmidtlepp is better! Save EURO together now!
"@Volker_Beck: just had a fractional meeting. Own majority for government stands! There are also some deviations, but that&#39;s democracy"
"@Volker_Beck then we have almost everyone together, I&#39;m very excited"
"@Volker_Beck Thanks to Volker Beck for a nice greeting, but I&#39;m not sure if B90 / Gruenen would get so much transparency in the long run. :)"
@LJRSaar Great that you haven&#39;t forgotten Wahl-o-mat on tour!
"@hideout I don&#39;t want to get out, and I definitely want to save euros, also for Greece."
"@kritikkultur Sigi texted my tweet. Will talk tomorrow. He is a very independent mind, but available for every discussion."
"@bernddublin does, growth weakens. But the Keynes strategy of the past 40 years has led to a mountain of debt."
"@bernddublin With guarantees and guarantees as well as consistent consolidation in every country, including us. Euro must remain absolutely."
"Talk in the SWR, unfortunately too much argument. But Euro not easy: Greeks have to help + avoid recession. There is no increasing debt."
"Kauder-Strikes does not work at all: Whoever steals books is a criminal, but you don&#39;t take your reading glasses away. Am 100% with CDU network and KoaV"
"This is my last Tweet for today, especially for Jan BW Kamp: Wonderful that you have responded!"
"@Pirat_JMaurer I&#39;ve been interested in for years, but pirate success shows how much we&#39;ve missed: the net is now about to hit the big bang"
"@mpucher don&#39;t know yet how to do that, but talk to my people"
"Thanks for Echo, is crazy. In future, tweets will be late in the evening because the day is busy. Tomorrow after 2 + Leif where I am with Oppermann. PS: I&#39;m really real!"
@karpfenpeter what has he done again?
"Hi, I&#39;m in, really! Bushes late (years?) Did not suspect that pirates are just (nice?) People. Thanks to @petertauber for basics"
@svnee And my constituency borders Luxembourg (Perl / Schengen). I know the Luxemburger Politician. The Pirates also find it exciting.
@ 0711thomas Twittern helps great to overcome distance. Much better than email.
"@schreyegg The hustle and bustle was real + necessary. But reason wins in the end. And thank God, we are responsible for Europe."
@F_Thewes Of course I also cook for non-rebels. And especially happy for people from the Saal region.
@larsbecker @EuropaUnionDE I&#39;ve thought about that. Therefore blog soon.
"@ jimraynor99 At the time, I was still thinking of phishing on the network. I probably didn&#39;t have time either."
@ralphmakolla Thomas Kossendey has good employees
"@Blackhalflife Saarlanders are ok. Think you visited me once. Book is still in the closet. Didn&#39;t really get it, but awesome"
@kritikkultur Thank you for always so prompt and committed comments!
