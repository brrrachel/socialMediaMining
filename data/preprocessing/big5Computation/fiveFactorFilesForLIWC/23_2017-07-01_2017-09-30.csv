The question is still whether he discussed this fall in the cabinet?
Days of conscious misunderstanding! What do you think of the whole thing? It&#39;s all about this. (everything has to be cleared up)
Nonsense. Just say it to yourself. And: Violence has never been a political tool for the Greens.
"Dear colleague, I&#39;ve known that for a long time. May be even longer than you? / In the nightly violent scenario, duty to think how out of there !?"
Great and in the end Otto Nirmal consumer counts higher insurance premiums. The money doesn&#39;t fall from the sky.
"Nah, annoyed."
Blue
And
Great level tonight
"Everything should be documented. But this was about societal change, more justice, where did that go ...?"
"I&#39;ve been thinking for decades, unlike others who haven&#39;t started yet!"

When did frenzy endanger the life and limb of others to the inalienable human rights?

#Lindner drives a strange show.
1) had announced #FDP not to form a coalition without # EhefürAlle 2) nobody asked in the #Bundesrat for yes / no / abstention! 3) be prepared
It is a # civil right against government to raise and demonstrate parliaments. # G20
Especially since the entire #CDU #CSU in the Legal Affairs Committee expressly waived the request to hear the Bundesrat law! # EhefürAlle
OK then! #EuGH strengthens #user rights. #Airlines must show #flight costs separately. http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/europaeischer-gerichtshof-setzt-transparenz-bei-flugnebenkosten-durch-a-1156194-amp.html…

Worth reading. The constitution is not a shrine. # EhefürAlle.
"My tweet referred to the one in front of me to make it clear that it wasn&#39;t about coalition options at all. I thought you understood .. ,,,"
#LiuXiaobo needs help!
Right. One more reason to be relaxed.
😜🌈The chairman of the legal committee of the Bundestag thinks that the #BVerfG will not consider this law to be unconstitutional. # 2017
There I find another article @SZ from yesterday about nightly session i #Bt. Education / help #ColoniaDignidad pic.twitter.com/aGMf1CugmY
The Chair of the Legal Affairs Committee likes to participate in &quot;discussion afterwards&quot;: # Ehefüralle is not unconstitutional. #deMaiziere It&#39;s # 2017
All marriage?
A step in the right direction. Please more....
