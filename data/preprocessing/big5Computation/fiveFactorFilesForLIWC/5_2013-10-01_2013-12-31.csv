"@palisadesberlin @tsghessen yawn! The @ SPIEGELONLINE reports are wrong, not yet decided. Welcome to reality :-)"
@NielsNauhauser @Gerdbillen Was not to be done with CDU / CSU. We had proposed compulsory net tariffs
@NielsNauhauser Hopefully in the finance group. Our proposals capping MRP interest and vending machine fees were rejected
"@triplehash nonsense. Surveillance must be stopped in domestic politics. With us, for example, injunctive relief against data protection violations"
The # coalition negotiations on consumer policy have been completed. Here is an overview! http://www.ulrich-kelber.de/service/archiv/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/index.html?date=2013-11-08+01%3A00%3A00…

Seehofer in front of the camera: &quot;Wish you what lists&quot; should not exist. Seehofer in the back room: &quot;More money for agriculture&quot; Well ...
"@DJFabianArndt Um, because there was no GroKo back then?"
@BILD_Politik Nice try :-)
Shameful finding of transparency for Germany. CDU / CSU block whistleblower protection more http://www.transparency.de/2013-11-05_EU-Whistleblowerber.2379.0.html…
@BILD_Politik After the circus so far? The CDU and CSU should come with a coordinated model and real numbers. Then we speak :-)
Merkel remains tough on toll :-) #Coalition negotiations http://www.stuttmann-karakteren.de/karessin_5056.html…
@newer Super-Schmarrn! High re-letting rents raise &quot;local&quot; comparative rents and lead to rent increases for everyone

@c_lindner Why did your party then burden the pension fund by cutting the federal subsidy?
"@BI_Automotive all previous suggestions burden the owners of small cars, disabled people, craftsmen etc."
Coalition negotiations in the Bundestag and the mobile phone operators are restructuring so that nothing is possible. The #NSA cannot listen in either way :-(
"Today a two-part day: morning and afternoon time for the family, in the evening Berlin"
@TimBagr @ben_reuter @energynet Official: energy concept. Negotiator is not public
@silviamolteni Yes! But other points from the paper are not
The energy paper quoted by Reuters is not the paper of the SPD negotiating group #Coalition Negotiations
"Good Morning. Today an internal round and three rounds with the CDU / CSU on coalition negotiations on consumer protection, the environment and agriculture"
"A long day comes to an end, 15 hours of preparation for # coalition negotiations tomorrow!"
Strengthening civil society such as @vzbv and @warentest but also urgently necessary after four years of black and yellow coalition negotiations
#CDU and @JuliaKloeckner now finally for more state consumer protection? It would be good if we see what&#39;s on tomorrow. #coalition
@Dukes_Secretary She is already doing it like Merkel and copying SPD proposals (Council of Experts for Consumers) that she has so far rejected :-)
"Hello, @Gerdbillen. SPD will negotiate with demand from market watchmen. @juliakloeckner was never negative"
"Today: meeting with ecologically oriented agricultural associations, SPD exam # coalition negotiations, meeting environmental associations, midnight :-)"
@Frankbadems me too!
@Frankbadems we do
How cool is that? #NSA #Stuttmann http://www.stuttmann-karakteren.de/karessin_5046.html…

@kmbirkel From our side it is addressed in environment / agriculture
Many ask me why I am not in the energy group of the coalition negotiations. The explanation is https://www.facebook.com/UlrichKelber/posts/461309510653632…
"@Gerdbillen @mechthildheil @drobinski Yes, coalition negotiations are about making the digital world consumer-friendly"
"@ThiloHoppeMdB Why didn&#39;t you negotiate? Recommendation now: wait for the end result, prejudices less serious"
"@FelixBonn Please do your research: I would have certainly been against it, but they replaced allied reservation rights. Also Art. 20 !!!"
@pkanzow And? Is he still MdB?
Nice reminder from Klaus Stuttmann of accusation &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; against SPD criticism of #NSA #merkelphone http://www.stuttmann-karakteren.de/karessin_5043.html
@PiratNrw Please do your research first: SPD has asked Chancellor to stop listening to citizens all summer cc @ThomasOppermann
@JakobSchlandt misjudgments about @tsghessen (wrote the SPD energy concept with me) and @P_Friedrich (progressive in terms of energy policy)
"@FelixBonn nonsense, even with coalition one remains political competitor"
@FelixBonn Is this the modern variant of &quot;Go over there!&quot;?
"@DieterTillmann They don&#39;t see themselves that way. Now, however, was more papal than the Pope"
@euleminerva I am responsible for four topics. But don&#39;t worry: I also get involved in energy negotiations
"@DieterTillmann I agree. Prank &quot;celebrity&quot;, put &quot;big animals&quot; or &quot;big heads&quot;"
#Merkel is a physicist. Perhaps now with #NSA the extrapolation from your own dismay to the fundamental problem works
"@DieterTillmann Oh come on! &quot;Celebrity&quot; was a substitute for party leader, parliamentary group leader, general secretary, prime minister, ..."
I like how many of our new colleagues in the group speak confidently and are not afraid of celebrities :-) #SPD
@EinAugenschmaus Fitter? cc @MarioGoetze @ZDF
@euleminerva Why is that please?
Opening speech Riesenhuber can be summed up well so far: &quot;Everything is good!&quot; # 18terBundestag
"Good Morning! Today, the new Bundestag is constituted and will initially become unfamiliar in the new round of seats without an FDP"
@DHoelder It&#39;s about the inventory
@reducenews I am talking about up to 50 billion per nuclear power plant
@dneuerer If you don&#39;t follow our suggestion
"Security of supply not through fixed government subsidies in the billions, but competitive. Then GuD prevail!"
"@newer government program! If the CDU has better suggestions, please. Not investing or hoping for tax blessings is not enough"
@dneuerer We force CDU / CSU to answer how they want to finance it and present our proposal ...
"@dneuerer Well, the gamble comes from the CDU / CSU, the SPD has proposed a non-cyclical financing of investments"
"According to my calculation, the British nuclear power feed-in tariff means 45-50 billion euros total remuneration per new nuclear power #lobbyist success"
"I read @Alex_Neubacher&#39;s comment on coal and green electricity production. Mistake: It is not EEG that leads to more coal-based electricity generation, but EnWG"
"The @Katrheina is a really good (re) choice, dear @nrwjusos"
@papapreuss Just wait and see and then vote on the result
Technical problems on both successive trains? There are coincidences [\ sarkamusoff]
@papapreuss I decide on content. Are you afraid to sound it out?
De Zoch kütt ... far from it. How many hours do you actually have to book earlier to reliably reach connections? :-(
Urgent eleventh core demand of the SPD in coalition negotiations: The railroad must become reliable again :-(
@ PEAubameyang17 The @peteraltmaier and I were on the plane together for an hour on Thursday and have already discussed everything
Good Morning! On the way to the SPD party convention in Berlin. Then the first days of the session
"SPD members Middle Rhine continue to be skeptical about GroKo content, but mostly at the general assembly for coalition negotiations"
"@wuchyliberal @lobbycontrol Who, however, could not donate € 230,000 at the 50,000 mark"
@wuchyliberal @lobbycontrol own 45% of the shares and benefit immediately
"@lobbycontrol Overall, the topic of transparency, UN convention etc. is also important for coalition formation"
An increase in the EEG surcharge could have been prevented if @peteraltmaier did not insist on the current form of surcharge formation! Intention?
"That makes @evonklaeden jealous: as a chief lobbyist at Daimler, he earns less than the CDU at BMW :-("
"CDU gets € 690,000 from profiteers of Merkel&#39;s resistance to climate protection requirements. Without any shame! http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/union-erhaelt-riesenspende-von-bmw-eignern-klatten-und-quandt-a-927871.html…"

"Good morning, today I&#39;m staying offline for nice family reasons :-)"
@pxxsxx 12 million Germans have chosen this program!
@andikynast Ok. But Seehofer is a very special poker player :-)
@andikynast @ZDF Today seriously: What do you expect three days before the interview? Coalition oaths in the blue? Content instead of headlines!
"The CDU criticizes that after the election we demand the same things as before the election! What&#39;s wrong with that, Mr. @ArminLaschet?"
"@Medididi Thank you, but I&#39;ve been showing this work behavior for 13 years, right?"
@penpendede We do that too. But I criticize the detached media debate. Good schools and renovated bridges are the topic !!!
@Dukes_Secretary @JohnSturges Fighting tax fraud and eliminating loopholes could lower middle income taxes
@Naturschutz_MW Always come with it. I even prevented a new motorway connection in Bonn :-)
"@wuerzbach With a reversed argumentation made it clear that a higher top tax rate means that, for example, bridges are being renovated"
@dneuerer stands as examples in the government program: eg company and company car privilege
@Vincentkiefer romance is different :-)
