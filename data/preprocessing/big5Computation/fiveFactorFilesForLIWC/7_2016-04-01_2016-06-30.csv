Nothing there - neither opposition in government nor good junior partner but counterweight. SPD would have accepted Sch√§uble&#39;s proposal.
"The SPD would have accepted Sch√§uble&#39;s constitutional proposal as a compromise, the CSU was too left."
There will therefore no longer be fair inheritance taxation in this legislative period - that is not possible with conservatives!
"With Union there is no tax justice, also no citizen insurance, no modern family or integration policy."
Constitutional Court calls for fewer exemptions for heirs of large corporate assets. A fairer inheritance tax is only possible in a different coalition!

"@ Waldkauz15 No, but there are laws and independent courts that determine what is still freedom of expression and what is not!"
Freedom of expression also includes the right and freedom to clearly criticize other points of view and opinions.
Freedom includes enduring and tolerating opinions and statements even when they go completely against the grain.
There are many opinions and cultural contributions that I don&#39;t like at all. But I am against any censorship!

"Later press conference for our SPD state party conference on the weekend, then citizen consultation in the constituency office in Bordesholm."
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today council of elders to prepare the state parliament plenary, office appointments in Kiel, discussion with charities."

A SPD chancellor would have exercised policy competence or casting decision less embarrassingly. Culture freedom instead of chewing before potentates!
Merkel apologizes for ZDF satire to Erdogan and applies majesty insulting paragraphs against SPD vote - we will abolish him!
"ZDF satire is logically not suitable for state affairs, nor for government crises. But shows differences between Union and SPD!"
ZDF make satire a state affair and apologize to foreign potentates for it shows a blatant lack of judgment.

(2) This is then criticized and not the long-standing blockade by conservatives and liberals in Germany and Europe!
"Political amnesia is booming. According to #panamapapers, SPD repeats calls for tough action against tax criminals (1)"
Sigmar Gabriel sums it up: The greedy money of the super-rich combines with the lack of conscience in the banking and finance sectors.
There may also be justified exceptions to this principle in individual cases.
Some things that are still legal but not legitimate have to be re-regulated by law! Better if what is not legitimate is also illegal!
"Not everything that is (still) legal is legitimate. You will not (yet) be punished for this, but you may very well be criticized for it!"
@nveritatis This is really a completely new and really original accusation to my address. What is the name of what you are taking?
Some people go far behind bars for far less damage to the community than do millions of tax fraudsters.
"Tax evasion worth millions must lead to a mandatory prison sentence: no deals, no probation, no luxury conditions."
Banks that favor tax evasion should be able to withdraw their banking license.
Firms that do not pay their taxes where they make the profits should also be denied market access for their products.
Companies that do not pay their taxes where the profits are generated would have to withdraw their operating license!
The only legal &quot;mailbox companies&quot; that may still exist are companies that produce mailboxes. Everything else is forbidden!

"Tax fraud in the millions is serious crime. Given that, prominent criminals like UH or AS get away pretty cheaply."
Whoever withholds taxes worth millions from the community is partly responsible for child poverty and many other deficits in our country.
There are entire law firms that &quot;earn&quot; their money by helping their clients with tax evasion pardon &quot;tax optimization&quot;.
Tax refugees cost us far more than war refugees. The former are often spared against those who have done nothing wrong!

I felt that 2016 brought too many death messages in just three months.
