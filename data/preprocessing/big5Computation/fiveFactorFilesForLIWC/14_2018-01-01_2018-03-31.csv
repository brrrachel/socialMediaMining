8.30 a.m. hall opening - 10.00 a.m. - Pol. Ash Wednesday in Passau! # csuam18 https://t.co/3pvRxdORk7
Political Ash Wednesday of #CSU in #Passau! # csuam18 https://t.co/PsmjK7LbEX
"Anticipation! On Ash Wednesday, the whole of Germany looks to Lower Bavaria. Passau - the south curve of the #CSU. # CSUAM18 https://t.co/CCZ56bkOsY"
Fought hard for content for a good deal with the @spdde. Important departments to give Germany a new dynamic. Negotiated for 25 hours! #GroKo https://t.co/NKrzQqjjYf
"There are already hardship cases for a few cases per year. So there is no more immigration to the existing agreements, but better control and order with a limiting effect. #Familiennachzug"
"As agreed in the exploratory paper with @SPDde, only a maximum of 1,000 people per month can then meet within the agreed total number - spouses and underage children. #Familiennachzug"
"@CSU keeps its word. The #Family reunification for those in need of subsidiary protection remains suspended and will be abolished. As of August 1, there will no longer be a general right to family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status."
We reject multiple turning. Bigamy and polygamy are prohibited in Germany. These are precisely the cases that upset citizens to show their displeasure with protest. #Familiennachzug
There must not be a #family reunification of second women to Germany. Such decisions disregard the principles of living together in our country.
"It is time to get started digitally: Our goal is that all people, young and old, whether in the city or in the country, benefit from the new opportunities. Not to be paralyzed by fear, but to develop dynamism with courage. #Digitization #Germanydigital"
Everything was regulated in the #Sondung: That is why the firmly agreed regulation on #Family reunification for those in need of subsidiary protection from the Groko preliminary contract remains. There is no room for negotiation for #CDU and #CSU.
"#Germany shows the world a really high level of humanitarian responsibility, especially for refugee families. The ability to integrate in our country is limited. #Family reunification #Groko"
