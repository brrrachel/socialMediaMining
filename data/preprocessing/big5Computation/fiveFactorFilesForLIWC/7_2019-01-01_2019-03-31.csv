Today at the annual reception of the Hamburg SPD in Hamburg City Hall.
"For the rest, the Union is discussing refugee policy in a way that cannot be done with us!"
"Yesterday, the popular initiative for affordable housing gave its signatures in the state house. Unctuous but meaningless speech by the CDU President Schlie. The SPD, on the other hand, supports the popular initiative on the matter and advocates a constitutional amendment."
The HSV has earned a deserved away point at the strong FC Heidenheim. Let&#39;s see if the Kiel storks can advance to fourth place today with a win against F√ºrth.
Together with Beate Raudies I was just in trouble and honored Erika Zieger for 50 years of SPD membership. The surprise was a success.
Decent social democrats don&#39;t want to have anything to do with Sarrazin. Intolerance and racism contradict our basic values as well as the anti-Islam rhetoric and the agitation of evil anti-foreigners resentments. https://twitter.com/tazgezwitscher/status/1112404197977346048‚Ä¶

At the party congress and also at the party evening there was a warm farewell of the departing board members by the delegates and the full-time employees. Today I go back to Berlin in the evening.
"Today the second day of our state party conference in Norderstedt. After yesterday the state board was newly elected with Serpil Midyatli, S√∂nke Rix, Sophia Schiebe, Stefan Bolln and 7 assessors, the focus is now on party reform. There was a lot of applause for @katarinabarley"

This morning first in the ZDF studio in Kiel and an interview with @morgenmagazin on the subject of arms exports. We have just decided in the SPD European election program that we do not want arms exports to crisis areas and dictatorships.
"Yesterday evening at the event at the school on the Eiderwald in Flintbek in my constituency, those present agreed that the school had to be rebuilt. This creates good prospects for schoolchildren, teachers and the educational location Flintbek."

"In the UK, a million people demonstrate against BREXIT and the European political madness that goes with it."
"The week is all about the state party conference, at which I will hand over the state presidency after 12 years. Today, party council, press conference, media appointments and speech preparation - this is a turning point, even if there is still enough work to be done as a faction and deputy party chairman."
The party presidium and party board later meet in the Willy-Brandt-Haus. It is particularly about the European elections.

The EU gives Great Britain two more chances to form an opinion in Parliament. What this means for BREXIT remains unclear.
"In the evening we go back to Berlin, where tomorrow the SPD European Convention will take place and we want to end our election program for the European elections."
In the afternoon we discuss with climate change policy with students who are involved in @FridayForFuture.

Today various talk and media appointments in the Kiel State House. Later constituency appointments in Nortorf at the primary school and in the youth club. In the evening with my colleague Beate Raudies in her constituency in Elmshorn.

Donald Trump vetoed that the US Congress rejected its idiotic &quot;emergency wall&quot; against Mexico in both chambers. Perhaps the judiciary will now stop the egomaniac&#39;s brazen breach of constitution in the White House.
"Today HSV has to play against Darmstadt, after yesterday the Kiel storks won 5-1 against Aue and SC Freiburg deserved to kidnap a point from M√∂nchengladbach. This afternoon I drop by the Filius, whose Oberligateam Bordesholm receives PSV Neum√ºnster."
Impressive demonstrations of &quot;Fridays For Future&quot; all over the world. Schoolchildren are committed to climate protection + the future of our planet. Just like we used to do with peace and anti-nuclear demos. Arrogant reactions from @PaulZiemiak + @c_lindner reveal a lot about CDU &amp; FDP.
"Uncertainty as to how BREXIT crisis will be resolved continues. Theresa May loses one vote after another, a no deal BREXIT was rejected yesterday by the House of Commons without any time limit. But whether there is still the May deal, new elections or a second referendum - nobody knows."
"Yesterday I had the opportunity to discuss with Olivia Bailey and Andrew Harrop from the Fabian Society, with Labor colleagues Roger Liddle in the upper house and with Jon Trickett, Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Ed Miliband in the lower house."

Another defeat for Theresa May: Unterhaus rejects tough (NoDeal-) BREXIT without time limit. Not legally binding but political rejection of worst case scenario for Great Britain and Europe. Not only here in London great guesswork as to how to go onü§î
Now the House of Commons is voting on whether or not a ‚Äúno-deal Brexit‚Äù will be pursued as a possible option. This would at least remove the worst alternative for the UK and Europe.

Passionate debate yesterday in the state parliament on gender parity in parliaments. For all tricky legal questions that may need to be resolved for a constitutionally compliant regulation - in essence it is about actual political will - and that is missing - except for the SPD and Greens.
Those who want to go back to the 1950s socio-politically in order to fish a bit on the right edge and heal the tornness of the Union and have to make bad jokes about minorities have other problems than just a lack of carnival talent.
"Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer @akk complains about the cramped lack of humor in politics. She may be right, but the problem is not so much the bland joke and bad taste of her handmade speeches, but her reactionary stance on gender issues."
"In any case, we managed quite well to make clear the political stance and the alternatives of constructive opposition work."
"Yesterday, the black coalition coalition in the north was again torn and disputed not only in the debate about our demand to anchor climate protection as a state goal in the state constitution. The same applied to the subject of full veiling at the university."

A climate protection law is also agreed in the coalition agreement at federal level. That has to come to meet the climate goals for 2030! The SPD wants to shape the necessary socio-ecological structural change for our industrial society with the citizens.
"The North SPD has launched an initiative to include climate protection as a state goal in the state constitution. Let&#39;s see how the other parties behave, who are asked by @FridayForFuture rallies of young people about their attitude just as we do."

"The Union is gradually realizing that our concept of a modern social welfare state based on solidarity with citizens&#39; money, basic child protection, basic pension and increasing minimum wages is receiving approval, and so the first dubious offers come from the ranks of the conservatives."
"The state parliament once again showed the torn and disputed nature of a coalition that constantly praises itself for how great + tolerant it is in dealing with the (many) dissent. In truth, the pose is compromising the formula and aggression against the opposition."

One of the many negative aspects of Donald Trump&#39;s term in office is that we may be faced with a new arms race again. The SPD stands for new initiatives of a committed German and European policy for peace and disarmament.
Does anyone think that there is any benefit to one&#39;s own party when retired politicians speak unkindly about their successors? That only benefits political competition. It testifies to poor memory and is also unsound.

In the evening as a guest at the SPD in Ascheberg.
"Today plenary session on the consequences of the BREXIT for our country. A prime example of what happens when nationalists + European haters gain influence. If you want to keep prosperity and peace, you have to stand up to right-wing radicals, for example from the Asocial Group of Germany (AFD)."

"It follows that from wind energy to municipal finances, from daycare politics with immense parental contributions to the salaries of state employees, from A20 to road construction contributions, one campaign flight after another will burst like a black balloon."
Yesterday&#39;s state parliament debate on wind energy has shown that so much PR-Prime Minister&#39;s son-in-law and Jamaican monetary gifts here and there cannot hide that the election victory was achieved with false promises on the big issues.

Yesterday evening visit to the social association in Kiel. Strong association with a good socio-political compass. Excellent speech by the Ombudsman of Schleswig-Holstein Samiah El Samadoni.
"Strange discussion yesterday that and why the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is finally dealing with right-wing populists and enemies of democracy. There were a number of reasons why Mr. Maassen&#39;s departure was overdue, and if his successor targets AFD, that&#39;s a good thing."
Today first a radio interview with the Hessischer Rundfunk. Later appointments in the Kiel State House. A discussion with schoolchildren and then the citizens&#39; consultation in the constituency in Bordesholm. In the evening guest speaker at the SPD&#39;s New Year reception in Neum√ºnster.
Herbe Schlappe for Theresa May. Unclear how to proceed. The fact remains that Britain&#39;s exit from the EU would be a tragedy for the British and for Europe.

A slapping slap in the British House of Commons for the BREXIT deal by the conservative Prime Minister Theresa May.

"Debate about violence in our society requires clarity and differentiation at the same time. Clarity regarding the ban on violence, no matter by whom, against whom and for what reason. Differentiation regarding necessary hard political struggle without agitation + hate propaganda."

Comments in the morning press also shed light on the situation of social democracy and rightly advise us to take a firm look at our programmatic profile sharpening and not to get bogged down in issues that are not currently pending.
"Today, the commentators also shed light on the weird sides of the Twitter and Facebook debate, such as gestures of arrogance staged with humility, and the instrumentalization of communication channels for serious political misjudgments."
"Some debates shake your head rather than gain knowledge. Everyone knows that &quot;social&quot; media have very anti-social aspects. Everyone decides how to deal with it. I&#39;ve been doing this for over ten years. Not every tweet was successful, of course. Such is life üòâ"

Shame on the weekend also the populist statements of Wagenknecht&#39;s &quot;get up&quot; movement against public service broadcasting. That hardly differed from the anti-press attitude of right-wing populists that despised democracy.
Interior Minister Seehofer now has to deliver: What did the Federal Office for Data Security know when? And what is being done to ensure the protection of confidential communication data in the future?
"Many reactions in recent days show how important the programmatic reform process can be for the SPD. At the end of such content-related clarifications, there are also personnel decisions for the next chancellor candidacy - ideally after competition and member vote."

Yesterday at the well-attended annual reception of the municipality of Bordesholm in the town hall.
"It is one thing that the attacks are believed to come from the right. The other is careful handling of your own and third-party data. After all, a robust digital infrastructure is required to protect sensitive data. Data protection is mandatory!"
"Data scandal surrounding Leaks confidential data from politicians, journalists and actors raises many questions. It&#39;s about more effective data protection and defensive democracy. It must be possible to keep confidential communication internal - at the same time, caution is advised."

"It is good that discussion about the reorganization of the social security systems is picking up speed. Especially in the digital world of work, our welfare state must remain solidary!

Instead of abolishing the solos for 90% of those affected - as agreed in the co-agreement - Union &amp; FDP also want to give super-rich people like Dax board members a six-figure tax cut. Relieving the burden on the middle class is okay - but not the upscale Merz version with its own aircraft park.
Hopefully Donald Trump gets a bloody nose for his snap idea of a wall between the United States and Mexico in the now democratically controlled House of Representatives.

My music tip for you out there in digital orbit is no alternative today after an urgent request from the battle center of the German boulevard üòâ: Elton John - &quot;I&#39;m still standing&quot; Have a nice Tuesday ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch? v = DdxBQY9j8Ik &amp; feature = share‚Ä¶
"What the Federal Government Commissioner for the East, Mr Hirte (CDU), has given away, damages his office and offends citizens not only in the new federal states. The party-political lumberjack style is said to hide its lack of concept and failure. üëé"
Social welfare concept of the SPD: &quot;If the others rub it off - good&quot; - Politics - Tagesspiegel https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/sozialstaatskonzept-der-spd-wenn-sich-die-anderen-dran-ieben-gut/ 23974536.html‚Ä¶
"Citizen benefit, basic child protection, basic pension, rising minimum wages and qualifications + longer entitlement to unemployment benefits are basic elements of a modern social welfare state based on solidarity. After the C, Mr. Dobrindt also forgets the S in the CSU party name and prefers to flash on the right. https://twitter.com/WELTnews/status/1094989266126598145‚Ä¶"

The Prime Minister of Hesse Bouffier criticized that the SPD wanted to take decisions at the board meeting that could not be implemented with the Union in the grand coalition. Potzblitz! We actually have our own ideas beyond what the Union likes!
"In competition with the &quot;Either-Or-Parties&quot; we want fair, future-oriented and everyday concepts for work AND the environment, city AND country, old and young, Germany and Europe, German and non-German, majority AND minority SPD as a party of the social cohesion!"
"In Berlin today, the SPD party executive&#39;s opening exam. We have some plans. It is about the modern welfare state in the digital world of work, the necessary socio-ecological structural change for our industrial society, Europe and the world."

It&#39;s just over next to it - that&#39;s not only true in football. üòÇ I was concerned with uninhibited selfishness.

"In the meantime, you intellectually disappoint me with a dismaying regularity, where I have so far always contradicted all those who keep saying that they just couldn&#39;t do it anymore üòâ https://twitter.com/LukasKilian/status/1094168426774437889‚Ä¶"

"Decades of zeitgeist: liberalization, private in front of the state, deregulation, &quot;stinginess is cool&quot;, ego in front of public spirit etc. has also caused damage to the mind. Unbelievable how many people throw their rubbish into the landscape everywhere, treat people with disrespect and rude ü§î"
That&#39;s the way it is. https://twitter.com/welt/status/1094147156095713285‚Ä¶
Absurd newspaper comment: Coastal coalition has turned state police into a piggy bank - Jamaica will fix that. The biggest improvements for the state police for decades had already been decided or implemented by the coastal coalition.

"The right-wing populists complain that the protection of the constitution wants to protect the constitution from its enemies. Such lawsuits would be prohibited in the social order that Gauland, Weidel, Meuthen, H√∂cke &amp; Konsorten seek. #Just for fun"
"At times the tone may have been a little quieter than usual, the content of Donald Trump&#39;s &quot;State of the Union&quot; - speech remained primitive, aggressive and complacent - unworthy of a great liberal democracy."
"Exciting debate about the future of our welfare state. Unlike others, we do not want a social transfer society with nice-sounding labels for what people copy or accept. We believe in the right to good work, participation and decent pay."
Today various office appointments in Kiel. In the evening discussion round with the Hamburg party friends in Hummelsb√ºttel.
It is a shame for the Kiel storks and their fans that despite oppressive superiority they lost the cup game against the first division side from Augsburg with 0: 1.

"Ceremony for 100 years of the Weimar constitution of the Reich reminds us Germans that democracy does not come by itself and does not remain by itself. It is again important to fight for freedom and peace, for Europe and against nationalists and enemies of democracy!"
Exciting first cup day with convincing winners from the north.
"&quot;State of the Union&quot; speech again showed US President Trump as the egomaniac that terrifies friend and foe. Almost nothing can be rationally understood, much looks like from a bad film with a protagonist exaggerated to caricature."
"Later meeting of the trade union council in Kiel. In the evening, the first of four regional dialogue events on the party reform of the North SPD in Schwarzenbek."
Yesterday in a long parliamentary group meeting we decided on various initiatives for the next parliamentary session. I will present some of them to the press this afternoon with my colleague Serpil Midyatli.
"Today first appointments in the Kiel State House, among other things, on the situation of the yards in the north."

"Well, a little class struggle from the top right on Monday morning ... üòâ There is no better reason why the SPD is pushing for a fair minimum pension. Long-term work, child rearing and care are life&#39;s work that deserve more than social transfers! https://twitter.com/gaborsteingart/status/1092352111285862400‚Ä¶"
"THE Board, THE Politics ... Papperlapapp like nine times wise advice from a political off üëé 2019 is our agenda: 1. Solidarity social security in the digital world of work 2. Work and consistent climate protection 3. Global justice, peace, social Europe! 4.KLARTEXT + courage! https://twitter.com/janboehm/status/1092341236835463168‚Ä¶"

Those who want to combat disenchantment with politics and the populist beneficiaries from the right do well to ensure that the language of the authorities becomes more understandable and that modern democracy in the 21st century is justified.
Landtag director criticizes the SPD parliamentary group and the Ombudsman&#39;s initiative for a more understandable language in the case of notices + official correspondence with citizens. Legal technocrat German breathes the spirit of the sovereign state. This can be done better!
"The New England Patriots win the Super Bowl once again. You still sympathize a bit, even if the time in the Boston Area was a while ago."
Today is a day of desk work. Preparation also for the annual opening of the party board.
"Debate on the SPD Proposal of a minimum pension that deserves the name and also expresses material respect for life performance through work, child rearing or care. Conservatives and liberals should explain their social transfer world - this political competition is good!"
Good morning from Bordesholm. My music tip for you out there in digital orbit is a bit gray and comes from Duke Ellington - &quot;Clouds in my heart&quot; Have a nice start to the week ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yxzkRNT-o4&amp;feature= share‚Ä¶
A major priority for the Union: one (Brinkhaus) wants to delay the exit from coal-based power generation and has not understood that ecological restructuring of industrial society is absolutely necessary. The other (Ziemiak) argues in the Cold War armament logic.
It is a good thing that Mr. Ziemiak made it clear once again that the party that has consistently campaigned for its own German initiatives for peace and disarmament is social democracy. The Union stood and stands more for classic armament policies. https://twitter.com/dpa/status/1091992423360802818‚Ä¶
"With the small but subtle difference that what the Union calls &quot;basic pension&quot; is significantly less than what we Social Democrats want, namely a just recognition of life&#39;s work through decades of (poorly paid) work. https://twitter.com/alexbercht/status/1091987723781586944‚Ä¶"
I look forward to many familiar faces at the annual reception of the SPD citizens&#39; group in the beautiful Hamburg town hall.
"Congratulations to Hans-Jochen Vogel, who is celebrating his birthday in Munich today. üéä"
In the morning press @hubertus_heil makes it clear that we Social Democrats will present a reasonable concept for a minimum pension that deserves the name. This is much better than intra-party personnel quarrels.
"In the evening, the third regional dialogue event on party reform of the North SPD in Schwentinental."
"Today, the state parliamentary debate on the basic pension, with which we want to see the lifetime achievement (mostly of women) of long-term poorly paid work, child-rearing or care valued. Counter arguments from conservatives, liberals and the economy are not convincing."
"Debate also about decision of the University of Kiel. Headscarf yes - full veil no! This course is correct because it preserves freedom of religion, but at the same time respects the customs of communication in Germany and does not promote provocation."
"Yesterday&#39;s debate on illegal online gambling: the other parties continue to want a special route for Schleswig-Holstein. The red carpet is being rolled out for the gaming industry, and comparable funding for wind energy, which is so important for climate protection, would be in the country&#39;s interest."

"CSU propaganda chief Dobrindt calls the basic pension in the Bavarian beer tent sound &quot;left distribution orgies&quot; of an SPD, which is &quot;bitten by left monkeys&quot;. For 5 million families, as for us, this is more respect for the lifetime achievement of long-term work and raising children."
Today plenary session of the state parliament with a speech by the Minister of the Environment on coastal protection in Schleswig-Holstein. We expect groundbreaking news in his first government statement. Current hour for illegal online gambling and the black-and-green pro-gambler policy.
Yesterday evening in Tarp good discussions at the regional dialogue of the North SPD on party reform.
