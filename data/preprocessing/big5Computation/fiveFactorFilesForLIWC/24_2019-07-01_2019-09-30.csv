Only a clear dividing line and firewall against these attacks on civil society and the democratic constitutional state can be the answer.
Civil society is essentially based on the claim of freedom and equality among its members. The AfD has started to attack this core.
There is an ideological axis between Gauland (against equality) and Kubitschek (for one&#39;s own) and both work to find an answer to cultural and political exclusion and to weaken defense mechanisms against them through camouflage.
"In this way, an ideology of inequality and the emphasis on terms such as one&#39;s own (in contrast to what is foreign / foreign) or national identity propagates a categorization of people, their value and their rights."
"Citizenship and democracy are claimed for themselves and attempts will be made to interpret these terms as political categories. &quot;Thinking civilly means thinking in order of rank,&quot; Gauland claims."
"with his emphasis on &quot;his own&quot; and whitewashing even those who sail hard on the National Socialist wind in the AfD, the double strategy to which one has to adjust in the near future becomes clear."

"Hello @stadtdortmund: what&#39;s going wrong? #BDS is suspect, really? #nobds just lip service? What does the anti-Semitism officer @sls_fdp Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger say about this? https://www.ruhrbarone.de/dortmund-ehr-schriftstellerin-kamila-shamsie-die-nicht-in-israel-veroeffuellen-moechte/172955‚Ä¶ @NRWpunktDE @ArminLaschet via @ruhrbarone"
there is also secondary criminal law. These are all penal norms (sanction: fine or imprisonment) outside the penal code. (This is possibly meant by the BMG law (leadership questions) - namely the @BMJV and not the @BMG_Bund would be responsible for StGB.)
Apart from that: @GrueneBundestag only require regulation in the law on administrative offenses and the factual situation is also reduced compared to the proposal of the @mhstiftung. http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/19/079/1907932.pdf‚Ä¶
&quot;not a criminal offense&quot;? Where&#39;s that at?
What signal?
"what reasoning should be criticized? Didn&#39;t read the brochure, just the recommendations at the end."
I hope that @jensspahn is more oriented towards the @mhstiftung than @BrunnerGanzOhr &amp; @spdbt. Criminal law is ultima ratio.
I had previously criticized the punitive framework of the @spdbt proposal: https://twitter.com/Volker_Beck/status/1166324770364887040?s=20 ... the @mhstiftung is more correct.

What should the criticized @IM_NRW do? Minister @BMI_Bund Seehofer is responsible for the ban on @hizbollah. Here @hreul can at best steam the lax position of the federal government at the IMK.
The more stringent form applied from 1935 to 1969. Everything is in the linked article.
The perspective of criminal law (in dubio pro reo) is different from that of the newspaper reader. The statement does not contain a specific call to crime and is therefore not punishable. Scandal is that Seehofer does not have the guts to issue a ban on @hizbollah by @BMI_Bund.
"Um, did anyone say that homosexuality was no longer punishable? Incidentally, it does not begin in 1872. 1872 is only the entry into force of the RStGB."
Because it makes a difference whether I am left alone as a victim of an attack or carried in a group of peers. Germans are largely ignorant to indifferent to anti-Semitic incidents.

The @ZentralratJuden represents 95 or rather 99% of the Jews organized in Jewish communities. He is pluralist.

"&quot;The rent limit does not affect the property to the extent that permanent losses for landlords, a risk to the substance of the rental property or the loss of any meaningful use would be expected.&quot; Sic!"
"Regulated rents are included. On the one hand, these effects occur at different times and are mitigated by the fact that the maximum permissible rent may exceed the local comparative rent by 10%. ‚Äù"
"&quot;Finally, the possibilities of using residential property are not unreasonably restricted by the fact that the standard rental price on which the upper rent limit is based increases with the progressive validity of the upper rent limit"
&quot;The restriction of the rent level regulation to tight housing markets ensures that it can be used in those municipalities or parts of municipalities where the interests of prospective tenants require special protection.&quot;

There is nothing to gloss over the statement. I just wanted to point out that one criticizes precisely. The claim that someone other than anti-Semites is to blame for anti-Semitism as anti-Semites is a distortion and trivialization of anti-Semitism.
This is nonsense. I have been criticizing problematic developments for a long time and I was always allowed to say everything. Criticism must always endure counter-criticism.
"The sentence is wrong. But it does refer to ‚Äúpeople like you‚Äù, that is, to a part of the anti-Semitism critics who actually or allegedly inflate the anti-Semitism allegation. This targets Jews and non-Jews alike."

Your world perception really has a leap in the bowl. Not every Muslim thinks like Diyanet or the associations. Protecting human rights also means granting protection to refugees with whom you do not agree.
"No, you have to work on your selective perception. I also complained that DITIB&#39;s power policy, the failed expansion of the KRM, was not reported. And no criticism is not xy-phob. There are generalizations and demonizations."

It has nothing to do with each other. The ‚Äúneutrality‚Äù law is neither neutral nor constitutional. It is hostile to religion. Even senators violate this: https://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/antisemitische-alkuds-demonstration-in-berlin-fotostrecke-168974-9.html‚Ä¶
Isn&#39;t reading your strength?
"In the past, Petra Sch√∂ning had occasionally worked as a freelance trainer for GIZ&#39;s own Academy for International Cooperation (AIZ), says @giz_gmbh itself. So there is a need for clarification. I don&#39;t say more. And it is not the first case."
You think that&#39;s funny? @dudenverlag I think that&#39;s strange. https://twitter.com/Dudenverlag/status/1146673766803615744‚Ä¶
You think that&#39;s funny? I find that strange.
I had already done that a few days ago: https://twitter.com/volker_beck/status/1146381368781393920?s=21‚Ä¶
The @Jerusalem_Post is mentioned in sentence 2 of the report.
At @giz_gmbh there is a need for clarification: https://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/politik/antisemitismusvorwurf- gegen-nahost-referentin-der-giz/‚Ä¶
That you&#39;re talking nonsense.
"Certainly not from this process this week. And the AfD rushes, generalized. That is neither reporting nor criticizing. You will probably still be able to make this difference."
Not every form of devaluation of other people is illegal or even punishable. Right. But this is about supporting fundamental rights restrictions; that affects the FDGO. - And even legally permitted intolerance has no claim to be spared criticism.
There is nothing to gloss over the statement. I just wanted to point out that one criticizes precisely. The claim that someone other than anti-Semites is to blame for anti-Semitism is a distortion and trivialization of anti-Semitism. #correction
"Talk to someone else about your problem. At least I care about the borders that have to be defended, whether they are crossed by fundamentalist Muslims, crazy Christians or atheists on a crusade."
The fairy tale that Josep Borell will become EU foreign policy officer?
@Queer_de alone reports what the Diyanet with imams spreads in approx. 1000 German mosques for anti-constitutional &amp; anti-homosexual propaganda. There is also a parallel society if our press ignores relevant events in German Islamic organizations. https://twitter.com/queer_de/status/1146427279691698177‚Ä¶
With the saying he is a worthy successor to his predecessor. Seriously: You can only get something like this if you are cynical and do not live in Israel. This guarantees the EU&#39;s zero influence in Jerusalem for the time being. https://twitter.com/welt/status/1146416570966708224‚Ä¶
"The eternity guarantee of the Basic Law relates, among other things, to the human dignity of fundamental rights. It is a constitutional category, which is codified in Article 79 GG: https://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/79.html‚Ä¶"
Fundamental rights are subject to the eternity guarantee and anyone who opposes the FDGO is an enemy of the constitution.
There is freedom of the fool - yes. But anyone who questions the fundamental rights of others is questioning the constitution. Freedom doesn&#39;t go that far!
"Hello @GIZ_gmbh are these allegations correct? If so, how do you deal with such anti-Israeli agitation by one of your employees? # sch√∂ning cc: @BMZ_Bund https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Antisemitism/German-official-Israelis-execute-peaceful-Palestinian-protesters-594444‚Ä¶"

There was also no border opening in Germany. The inner European borders are open.
"but you can&#39;t go to court in democracy for that. The measure can be brought before the Federal Constitutional Court in an organ action. Has no member, not even @SteinbackErika. So it was legitimized."
". @ Uwe_Junge_MdL fans think politics puts people on trial. That&#39;s what the judiciary does in the rule of law. A committee of inquiry must stand up for wrong politics in democracy; one is not locked up, shot or &quot;disposed of in Anatolia&quot;. https://twitter.com/AnoMo70/status/1145780487740383232‚Ä¶"
there is no legal remedy for this without a People&#39;s Court without a freelancer.
you can easily draw the motivation for the murder of Mr. # L√ºbcke from it. What do you mean by &quot;holding accountable&quot;?
"Is Mr @Uwe_Junge_MdL just claiming that this tweet is not acceptable? @hartaberfair This claim, contrary to the rule of law, can simply be read as a request for lynching. And it is still online today. #hartaberfair https://twitter.com/Uwe_Junge_MdL/status/946869602553925634‚Ä¶"

"What kind of contact criminalization anyway? IGD / DMG, ATIB and IZH are members of the ZMD, aren&#39;t they? Do you want to claim that they had nothing to do with Muslim Brothers, Gray Wolves or the Iranian horror regime or never had anything to do with?"
The question remains why you do not owe the public the answer to these questions: https://twitter.com/Volker_Beck/status/1177878125709012992?s=20‚Ä¶
I have the same questions as the VG Wiesbaden: &quot;The overall association of the Central Council of Muslims consists of a large number of members with very different denominations and different interpretations of Islam.&quot; https://verwaltungsgerichtsbarkeit.hessen.de/sites/verwaltungsgerichtsbarkeit.hessen.de/files/PI%2015-19%20Islamunterricht%20in%20Hessen_0.pdf‚Ä¶
"what is your orientation? If I look at the positions of their members together, it doesn&#39;t give a picture."
Is that because of the police investigation or lay speculation that this got away when you were abroad?
"Who are your association members? Who are the members of the Scholars Council? Which decisions, among other things, on religious teaching content has the @der_zmd Council of Scholars made or is it a Potemkin village? Why is there no transparency? https://www.bundestag.de/resource/blob/644714/d3d63b246b0c6f1f1525c155ac324b4f/WD-1-005-19-pdf-data.pdf‚Ä¶"
"rather, it must actually be a religion and religious community, in terms of intellectual content and outward appearance."
