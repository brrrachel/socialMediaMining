Are there officials of the @der_zmd members at the Quds March in Berlin and is there a call from the Central Council to avoid this Israeli hate event?
"You&#39;re right about Hezbollah. It is a political and a wrong decision not to ban them entirely. In the Quds demo, it is society&#39;s job to show that we are against all anti-Semitism and not just against the right."

There can be no question of this in Israel when the Muslim percentage is 4 times higher.
the monolithic concept of Sharia in the sense of a law book is indeed a concept of struggle of the political right.
"In many Islamic countries, however, Sharia law is mostly made the basis of secular legislation in violation of human rights. The most prominent examples of this are Iran and Saudi Arabia."
"Sharia is, in fact, not a code of law, as many believe. It is the sources and traditions of the Islamic legal principles on which do&#39;s and don&#39;ts for all areas of life are based. How to interpret this is controversial among Muslims."
"Prohibition demands aim at eliminating freedom. Criticism, on the other hand, is legitimate and inherent in science."

Which Israel criticism - apart from the fact that it is a singular non-word - please? An author gives free rein to his fantasies without any factual core: this creates a new rumor about the Jewish state. Nothing else.
Anti-Semitism is the rumor about the Jews (Adorno). Israel is the Jew among the States (L√©on Poliakov). - You make up a rumor about Israel &amp; @TheMossadIL. You yourself introduced the word anti-Semitism into the debate. =&gt; Answer yourself!
Are you also behind @Nespresso? Then why do you pay so badly - if not at all?
It is the only one I know personally from the editorial team. And I don&#39;t trust him that he thinks this work is editorially justifiable.
"Do you have any factual evidence (witness, trace, etc.) on @TheMossadIL? - Your author&#39;s urine and innards of birds do not fall into the ‚Äúfactual notice‚Äù category."
"Where necessary, I also criticize them. But here Cicero has galloped up."
"Exaggerated, how is anti-Semitism exaggerated? It is unacceptable. Purely Jewish? A quarter of the Israelis are Arabs. According to the PLO, the Palestinian state alone is to become purely non-Jewish."
"However, BDS is not exaggerated, but essentially aimed at overcoming the Jewish and democratic state and anti-Semitic in communication: pic.twitter.com/8ifWD9SQwE"
"What is exaggerated about the resolution? I miss a lot (Ghorfa, AWV)."
"In Germany, the accusation of anti-Semitism is considered worse than the anti-Semitism itself."
Obviously the Lord is unable to grasp the meaning of texts. Should you remember articles about him that you are not familiar with.

"Where is your source I would have asked (sic!), Germans should learn languages? Listen to the interview."
Why are you lying There is no such requirement. https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Arabische-Prednten-sind-ein-Stueck-Heimat-article18860806.html ... the sentence you &quot;quote&quot; you have to find in the interview. An editorial summary is also not a quote.

"No, religion can develop freely. You can follow her, you can promote her, you can criticize her. That is freedom."
Understand the concern. It is not a good development. Unfortunately not here either: Where is the explanation of the @AuswaertigesAmt: https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/125793/pa-prioritizes-terrorism-payments/ ... or is this message wrong?
"the right of asylum protects the persecuted. These can even be bad people, as far as inhuman treatment or persecution threatens that is not based on law enforcement, protect the human rights conventions (GFK, ECHR) from persecution."
Religion is (only) as private as believers want it to be.
Anyone who claims that ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù protects the perpetrators must prove this.
"Human rights &amp; respect need international solidarity. Muslims after #Christchurch, #lgbtti because of the legislation in #Brunei. what do the Islam associations say about the disgusting campaign on twitter #IStandWithBrunei? @DITIBkoeln @der_zmd @igmgorg @Islamratbrd"
Religious freedom is always the religious freedom of those who believe otherwise. The freedom to wear a headscarf or not is protected under constitutional law. The liberal order proves itself in dealing with the practices of religious minorities. https://www.kreiszeitung.de/lokales/bremen/bremen-kopftuch-schulen-erlaubt-4851813.amp.html‚Ä¶
"If you want to eavesdrop on others on the street who speak English, French, Hebrew, Bavarian, Turkish, Flat or Arabic, you have to learn their language. Everyone can talk about how his beak has grown."

Different mother tongues are spoken in each country. It is crucial that everyone can communicate in the national language.

"I hope that this is just campaign noise. Indeed, that would not be in the interest of the Jewish and democratic state and its security. Netanyahu is trying to cannibalize the numerous right-wing parties in favor of the Likud by adopting their agenda."
You must prove this claim. Who does it where
I criticize racist statements against people with a migration background as I defend the religious freedom of Muslims. But I also criticize the politicization of the structures of Islamic organizations.
But they don&#39;t know that. And that is why it is a task and responsibility of the religious authorities. And it&#39;s not that there isn&#39;t always a need for clarification within the associations https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article209186093/Tuerkischer-Verband-macht-Stimmung- gegen-christliche-Kultur.html‚Ä¶
I&#39;m not criticizing the term crew. Occupation is bad for both the occupied and the occupied. But you also have to consider the reason for the crew. The West Bank is not Western Sahara. Defense war is not a war of conquest.

There would be no occupation if the Arab states had not attacked Israel&#39;s existence through their wars against Israel. And the occupation will end if there is a peace settlement that ensures Israel&#39;s security &amp; the conflict is resolved.

Each parliamentary group of the German Bundestag is represented on the Presidium by at least one Vice President. ... Whoever receives the votes of the majority of the members of the Bundestag is elected. ... Both conditions must be met.
"No, the suggestion that an election must be carried out, as it were, is disrespectful of the democratic election process, the freedom of conscience of Members and the regulations of the House."
An election process is always a decision on the election proposal. Then nothing.
You trusted the person who ran.
"Even if that were the case, the inhumanity that emerges is unacceptable."
"If you elect untrustworthy people to the Presidium, Parliament will be damaged. Therefore, every member of the Presidium must win the trust of the majority."
But that&#39;s not the average Muslim now. None of my neighbors in Kreuzberg run around like this.
It is a choice. And it is the right of every member of the Bundestag to elect a person who trusts them and not a person who does not trust them. There is nothing wrong with that. https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/afd-verlaesst-den-plenarsaal-bundestag-waehlt-harder-kuehnel-endgueltig-nicht-zur-vizepraesidentin/24182556.html‚Ä¶

Greetings to Mr. Walser eod
"Where should I have written, BDS see themselves as SS successors? It says: &quot;The use of SS runes in the # Eurovision2019 logo is secondary #antisemitism &amp; downplayed the Shoa.&quot;"
That described the @RUHRBARONE quite well https://www.ruhrbarone.de/bds-mit-ss-im-logo- Gegen-eurovision-in-israel/164408#‚Ä¶
"Assuming your thesis as a fact, you would collect the logo after appropriate criticism, right? But is still on their side."
"I just explained it to you, even with a link. Have a good time."
You mean the SS runes accidentally slipped into the logo? I would like proof of this assumption. Until then I assume the opposite because it is also popular in those circles. http://www.nichts- Gegen-juden.de/die-zionisten-sind-die-nazis-von-heute/‚Ä¶
Israel murdered 6 million Palestinians? At least something similar (= &quot;keep up with Shoa&quot;) says @DayanaKhalil. This is Holocaust harmlessization and an outright lie.
How do you dress as a Muslim? Most Muslims I know don&#39;t wear special clothes.
You should see a doctor. You can get help with delusions.
Do you think the SS has nothing to do with the Shoa?
I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. The semantics of our resonance and communication rooms are probably too diverse.

"I also think this classification is exaggerated. When in doubt, a democrat must always defend his point of view against everyone, against every anti-democratic attitude. It&#39;s a matter of setting &amp; it&#39;s a tactical question where there are no ultimate truths."
