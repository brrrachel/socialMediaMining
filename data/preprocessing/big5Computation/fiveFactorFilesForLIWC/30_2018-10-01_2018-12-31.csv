"+++ Horrendous new debt: they spin, the Romans! +++ #Italy relies on European solidarity or that the #EZB cancels the debt. This would make Germany once again the paymaster. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/1YEGOPk8oA https://t.co/dFeSi8Dj8K"
"+++ The Nikab is not part of Europe! +++ France went the right way. As a sovereign state, it has every right to determine for itself how far its citizens can be hidden in public. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/6TiaeguHjC https://t.co/Fl1CqNpidD"
"+++ Ridiculous: #Seehofer s re-entry ban has so far prevented 3⃣ illegal entries! +++ Now numbers are on the table for the first time, exposing all the rumblings from the summer for what it is: an absurd sham debate! #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/hZxXAfsA0h https://t.co/mIaMIyGwpY"
#Germany should pump another 15 billion euros into the #EU annually - because of the #Brexit. Our country is practically single-handedly responsible for the failure of Great Britain! #AfD https://t.co/bTw92HGpcD https://t.co/D74MpzJXMv
"Hypocritical: First #Merkel campaigns for #diesel bans, now she supposedly wants to prevent them! The # AfD faction clearly rejects # driving bans not only in #FFM! https://t.co/RfqqJr1Bth https://t.co/P252jz4pjS"
Outlaws &amp; damn terrorism and has been transferring money to the Palestinian executive for years &amp; days to prove the survivors. Provides terrorists with &quot;martyred pensions&quot; and runs anti-Jewish agitation in school books. Human rights? https://t.co/JyJ8ciJxVT
"The consequences of the illegal migration into the country, which has been taking place since 2015, are still incalculable, while the federal government not only sticks its head in the sand, but also talks about the situation with supposed success reports! #AfD https://t.co/GLE55cHbj3 https://t.co/JcJIj7qO81"
The Ministry of the Interior assumes that the figures for &quot;irregular migration are higher than those represented by the available data.&quot; In plain language: These statistics are not worth the paper on which they are printed! #AfD #LtwHessen https://t.co/A9EvRd0yKw https://t.co/zxJm9DlxDO
The current #Bundestag session is slowly coming to an end - we wish you a nice weekend and thank you for your great interest in our work this week too! #AfD https://t.co/3mBaaMwYBh
++ Request to rename a place in honor of Beltrame rejected! ++ The reason: The population of Marseille has changed over the years and such a place could &quot;provoke&quot; the inhabitants. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/E4JO9JN7fs
"+++ Will we pay for the unemployed all over Europe soon? Further burdens in the billions are emerging for Germany! +++ SOD: Nothing left for your own citizens, but distribute the money with your hands in the world. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/iz8LEQocOU https://t.co/SnzgUVNtz3"
"++ # Siemens boss #Kaeser is a hypocrite, as he is in the book. ++ Here in Germany he acts as a moral clean man, but in Saudi Arabia he has no problem dealing with potential state murderers put. #AfD https://t.co/iz8LEQocOU https://t.co/zTfPgf99YF"
"While the other political groups, and above all Angela Merkel, are always calling for “more Europe”, which actually means the dissolution of any sovereignty of the individual states, only dismantling the EU can ensure European unity in diversity. #AFD #Bundestag https://t.co/0moFtMOJzK"
"++ Specialists leave the country, net recipients come in droves! ++ The consequences are devastating. Well-trained and academics in particular are looking for space that our economy will then lack. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/c1fJNkQy9q https://t.co/NE5ntodBxF"
+++ It&#39;s time for #new elections at federal level! +++ The #Bavarian election has shown it clearly; #LtwHessen will confirm: The #Groko is finished. SPD &amp; CDU / CSU have worked in tandem. There was a receipt for that yesterday. It is therefore time for a fresh start. #AfD https://t.co/SNQuKrxY6C
I congratulate @AfD_Bayern on this huge success! #Bavaria voted and more than clearly rejected the policies of the CSU and thus the Chancellor. The #AfD is represented for the first time in the Bavarian state parliament with 11%. #LtwBayern # ltw18by https://t.co/OSmeq12blE https://t.co/YNb7OmO7ue

Dear #Bavaria! Your destiny will be chosen on Sunday. You have the possibility to finish the black felt of the Söder-Seehofer-CSU and to prevent the black-green ghost! Anyone who says #Merkelmussweg chooses @AfD_Bayern! #LtwBayern #LtwBy # LtwBy18 #Bayernwahl https://t.co/raRGS9OhhP
"+++ #Nahles threatens with &quot;Agenda tax money wasted&quot;! +++ If social democrats want to come up with a new welfare state concept, it is always bad news for the citizens. #Bundestag #AfD https://t.co/A9rQmuLFRN https://t.co/0ZpmMUdt2f"
It was great last night in #Bavaria. Thank you #LtwBayern #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/q0QVSW10PO
++ Security of law-abiding citizens must be given top priority again ++ The fact that Omar Ali-Khan was able to move freely around Berlin after his release from prison and commit crimes in series again cannot be conveyed to the citizens. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/A5NFAxUVil https://t.co/ZEMdK7vmSN

"+++ Budget for #integration increased by another 15 billion euros! +++ There is money for migration, only the citizens are left behind. The intelligence has apparently completely withdrawn from everyday political business. #AfD #Bundestag https://t.co/tjPnoN5vud https://t.co/TwsnKMoh5E"
+++ There is no limit to immigration without border security! +++ Prime Minister Daniel Günther (CDU) wants to renegotiate the #Groko asylum compromise after the election in Bavaria. Immigration law then attracts even more illegals to Germany. #AfD https://t.co/4tL3Lolqkm https://t.co/DHCo2StdKK
"@focusonline is handling questionable arguments to discredit the success of Swiss #asylum policy. @NZZ knows better - asylum applications have declined by 60% since 2015, which the Focus could have read here: https://t.co/1cqIV3d3jh"
+++ Refugee taxi &quot;#Aquarius&quot; must not get a new flag! +++ The growing pressure on private organizations has led to significantly fewer refugee boats setting sail from the coast of Libya. #AfD https://t.co/SVPjUAVz8c https://t.co/tWWz6hwzNp
+++ Denmark shows what a responsible # refugee policy should look like! +++ It depends on the performance of the host country and does not work according to the irresponsible # Merkel motto: &quot;Now they are there&quot;. #AfD https://t.co/bCxpIN22p2 https://t.co/gOMYRwsjSP
"+++ # Germany must not join in any case! +++ In a few weeks, the Global Compact for Migration should be finally decided - with far-reaching consequences that will completely overwhelm our society. #Migration Pact #AfD https://t.co/t6OxKgxCa1 https://t.co/8CZhgtiCdW"
I recently visited #Gamescom in Cologne - here is a short compilation. Many thanks to @AfD_FraktionNRW for the invitation! #AfD https://t.co/A100egdGBD
