@CarstenFSchmidt thank you!
@Ines_Schorsch carriage?
@ migrate89 The BMF is apparently less ambitious than the budget politicians of the Union and the FDP: they believe that debt-free in 2014 is possible
"... what emancipates people from all kinds of despotism, said Peter Sloterdijk recently. Today he turns 65 - congratulations! #Sloterdijk"
Liberalism again a synonym for generosity - and to make the word liberality a cipher for sympathy with everything ...
Tomorrow at 9.20 am on &quot;one to one&quot; on WDR television on the topic: &quot;Opposition or cooperation in NRW&quot; - and here: http://www.wdr.de/tv/einszueins/index.jsp…
@NicDiek One definition could be: Power is the ability to represent beliefs or plans against resistance.
@michsch parliament is called Bundestag. Building is called the Reichstag.
@NicDiek Until 9.7. I temporarily have both mandates. MP / Landtag. Do not worry: there is only one diet.
@mmarsching :-)
"Last group of visitors in the Reichstag passed: Students from my high school in Wermelskirchen. Oh, was nice in Berlin ..."
@Ines_Schorsch Then please support!
@Yariha @kaieff We have financed it seriously. And we are responsible for every euro of interim financing. But no worry.
"@xXDrakex are in contact. Today was not about concrete ideas, but about a government mandate. Not criticism, but a statement."
@Dave_Kay I&#39;m not criticizing the individual decision at # 20pirates - but a government mandate has been distributed there.
@de_quien_pueblo Ja. Hans-Werner Ehrenberg.
@herrasche Can be read on x old tweets: until 10.7. both - organize moving. Don&#39;t worry: diets will be charged
"@kpEschert @fdp_nrw You don&#39;t remember that exactly: tuition fees, social ticket, no additional state duties ..."
Congratulations to @HanneloreKraft for choosing. The half faction of the # 20pirates also voted for them - the hidden power reserve for red-green.
Here at the presentation at the state press conference. @MarcoBuschmann pic.twitter.com/sxAzgjeE
Presented @MarcoBuschmann as the new general secretary of #fdp in NRW today. I look forward to working with you!
@JoKnopp &quot;Rheinische Post&quot; from today. Google times. Otherwise buy it at the fuel station as a print.
"@Nick_Haflinger Is not meant personally, but as I said: We take the pirates seriously and at our word. No puppy protection for # 20pirates"
@Kommissar_Rizzo @bubernd @johannesponader No &quot;blah&quot; from Mr. Paul in the &quot;Rheinische Post&quot;. We take you seriously.
@BuBernd @JohannesPonader: Your NRWers want to merge police and constitutional protection. Are the federal pirates also for &quot;secret police&quot;?
Pirate faction leader in NRW wants to merge police and constitutional protection - Saving without civil rights? Is that the opinion of all # 20pirates?
"@Hermann_Ott Mr. Ott, do you only read headlines? You are not against renewables if you want to reform the EEG. Even demands Gauck."
"@ p0litix Then choose the left and be happy. Sorry, in case of personal hostility, I get out of the dialogue."
@Pereo&#39;s basis for assessment was a Swiss cheese at the time &amp; reduction by red-green (good!) Has stimulated the economy to this day.
@ p0litix Business and private assets are difficult to separate. Income tax is also often corporate tax. So: gibberish yourself.
"Curious: Kipping from the LINKEN wants 100 percent tax from € 40,000 a month = Bundesliga without stars, medium-sized companies without investments ..."
"@johannesgorges @ migrate89 In principle, yes. However, the nursing care is a different order of magnitude and a precautionary incentive."
@ migrate89 compromises in coalitions. You are JuSo: The childcare allowance was brought into the law gazette by the SPD during the grand coalition.
@ migrate89 Assume that # Rösler only approves the # childcare allowance on the condition that the federal government does not incur any new debts in 2014.

@schneidercar B-money is unfortunately a coalition compromise - you know it. It would be a good thing that the CSU would forego this in favor of budget compensation.
@schneidercar Ancient blanket argument. What about you with cable cars and river cruises?
"@UlrichKelber In my opinion, a further reduction in the feed-in tariff did not stall. I&#39;m for efficiency competition a la model monopoly commission."
"@UlrichKelber feed-in priority currently threatens grid stability. We all agree on the goal, we should discuss instruments."
@schneidercar In a tweet &quot;Economic outlook is deteriorating&quot; and &quot;Tax rate can be increased&quot;? Do tax increases help growth?
"@UlrichKelber @peteraltmaier But there can be no doubt that the EEG needs to be corrected: feed-in priority, photovoltaics ..."
"@ migrate89 Load transfers in Europe and acceleration of the deficit reduction were unforeseeable. Without that, I would be today for relief."
@ migrate89 Even as JuSo you will see that macroeconomically something has changed since 12-2009 ... A GS also does not speak for itself.
I am looking forward to the very positive feedback on my suggestion to propose @MarcoBuschmann as General Secretary of #fdp in NRW!

@ PsychoTR0N You don&#39;t have to find opinions well. But before evaluation you can try to understand. I often miss that with pirates.
@Aye feast when?
@ Treffnix79 @ugath That hits it. You do not have to worry about our finances - not with the% en and so committed members.
@AliCologne @klarerverstand @ psychotr0n I understand it already: no interest in reasonable exchange without polemics and kicks.
"@AyeFeast Sorry! With inclusion I am for example for joint lessons, but for some a special school may be better at times."
"@KlarerVerstand @ psychotr0n Unfortunately, too many pirates have no respect for other opinions. Therefore you are not a liberal party."
"@ PsychoTR0N Thank you for the great, argumentative reply."
@ Treffnix79 @ugath Why go into debt?

@cducsu panic? :-) The CDU in NRW (Laumann) issues red-black or black-green as election targets. The bourgeois alternative is the FDP!

@ Point1a What good question? I am happy to deliver here.
@ r3bug44 This is how I read your program. Favorite word: &quot;provide&quot;
@zebulonjackpot @ntvde Does that stick to surveys or programs? I am sorry for the latter.
"@AnnettKunze But that was rather a basic statement, I did not answer Opel. For clarification only."
@henninguhle I don&#39;t understand.
@mrtopf x new ones have been created in environmental management alone ...
"@mrtopf I can&#39;t do that with 140 characters. If you are interested, visit our website."
@Pirat_Robert @volker_beck The person does not belong to the FDP. Repugnant statement that has no place in a liberal party.
@propugnatio moment - I have expressed myself more differentiated and basically. Opel is not up for debate.

@Doris_Beck @fdp_nrw We disagree. I have to endure.
@ nati0n many thanks: who decided that?
"@Doris_Beck @fdp_nrw Do you think it helps the party to spread this out in public, Ms. Beck?"
@ Colin0711 funny character or not: The judgment should in any case not be based on false information.
We will then do the @RZ chief editor!
@Doris_Beck @fdp_nrw The reason for this has to do with the person concerned: the chairman. And in the most difficult situation I have responsibility in NRW.
@Gruenliberal Grübliberal - from Switzerland?
@Fison Klar: CV. Also at MP watch. The answer there will also be linked. All of this has nothing to do with NRW.
