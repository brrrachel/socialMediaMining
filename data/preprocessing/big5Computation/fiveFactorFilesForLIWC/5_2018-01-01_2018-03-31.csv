The rent brake cannot and will not prevent rents from rising if there are too few apartments. But it can slow down the growth rates. Therefore other measures are necessary

What did you agree on in the Jamaica exploratory paper?
They just don&#39;t decide that alone
"One thing is important to me: I simply don&#39;t see the black and white ‚Äúrenewal in opposition‚Äù or ‚Äúgood in government‚Äù. If you want to renew yourself, you can do so while solving important problems for citizens # spdbpt18"
The great @katarinabarley makes it clear: The new solidarity pension also increases the pension for many people who receive basic security today. We don&#39;t want to do without that # spdbpt18
"Towards the green: Jamaica exploratory paper also did not contain a date for the coal phase-out and (!) - in contrast to GroKo exploratory paper - no binding climate protection law. In other words, you negotiated less on climate protection than the SPD"
"Am I correct that Greens has not even raised the issue of the missing end date for the coal phase-out in Jamaica exploratory paper, dear @Hermann_Ott? http://www.tagesspiegel.de/downloads/20595568/5/skp1817440817111612110.pdf‚Ä¶"
"Once again, dear @jusos: It may be that ‚Äúforecasts‚Äù (by neoliberal economic researchers, by the way) predict pensions&gt; 48% by 2024 (!). However, we have negotiated legislative changes (!) That will secure 48% permanently, regardless of the economic situation # spdbpt18"
"Some speakers leave me at a loss: 150,000 jobs for the long-term unemployed, billions for education, more money for many low-wage earners. All just &quot;little improvements&quot;. Arrogant!"
Soon to be right :-)
"As Bonn, I think Bonn events are great. But in 2002 the SPD elected Schr√∂der in Berlin again as chancellor"
Whoever screams is wrong :-)
"You are right to ask us to continue to actively fight for climate protection in coalition negotiations (!), For example, to further underpin the Climate Protection Act"
"In the past, such intermediate images of people who listen closely were not published as alleged evidence of bad mood. Next picture with a frozen wink as &quot;proof&quot; of fatigue?"
"No. But if the CDU / CSU / FDP introduce a law, the votes of the SPD, Left and Greens are not enough to reject it. We would be dependent on AfD. Conversely, Schwarzgelb can block any SPD initiative that does not support the AfD"
"Not correct. According to the will of the conference presidency, Olaf Scholz should not keep the report of the proposal commission at the beginning, but rather weave it into his statement of opinion"
Why should the SPD actively (tolerance) hand over all government power to the CDU / CSU so that black and yellow politics can only be stopped in alliance with the AfD. AfD as a tip on the scales is a very dangerous idea #no minority government

"Even if the CDU wanted to form a minority government, the SPD should not (!) Tolerate it, because we could only do very little for the people"
"I don&#39;t want &quot;renegotiations&quot;, I want &quot;coalition negotiations&quot;. Nothing has to be renegotiated in consumer protection and digitization, for example, which would be called upon for the first time"
"If necessary, we Social Democrats make tough opposition policies, and we would rather improve people&#39;s lives through good government policies"
The CDU even elected its chairmen by applause for years in violation of party law
Martin Schulz said at the party conference in December that we would end coal-fired power generation. And now Germany would get a binding (!) Climate protection law for the first time. This is more than the Greens negotiated

"Because an open-ended exploration ends with a result (!). Don&#39;t bend everything, please argue based on facts"
"Incidentally, this is called &quot;coalition negotiations&quot;"
You have to do one without leaving the other. And I don&#39;t want to change the fact that the platforms have been rightly responsible for the fact that no crimes are committed on them for years
"Exactly, that&#39;s why a distinction is made between obvious and non-obvious crimes. And fines are only issued if a judge has previously confirmed the underlying examples as a criminal offense"
"My god, what a cowardly imp"
99% use the net without hate crime. The other 1% make a conscious decision and can also stop their criminal behavior
"Exactly, with criminal prosecution. But if you hold a concert and someone grabs the mic and calls for violence, you can&#39;t say that a judge has to decide whether you can turn off the mic"
Be brave and say exactly what you are going to do. This cowardly pressure is unbearable :-)

"There is no upper limit. Target size, by the way, net plus immigration law. But no restrictions on admission rights"
Climate: Law for the first time with binding requirements for all sectors !!! Pension: stabilization + solidarity pension (increased basic security)
Good explanation. Just one more time: they had to delete beforehand. Fines are now threatened if the deletion of criminal content is systematically refused
"It is not a (!) Coalition agreement, but a sampling of previously clearly controversial topics. Many other topics also not discussed"
"I am looking forward to the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù, I have had completely different experiences in practice"
