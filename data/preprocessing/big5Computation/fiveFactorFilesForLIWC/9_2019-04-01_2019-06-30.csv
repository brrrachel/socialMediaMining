Therefore our answer is: A new welfare state for the FRG with a basic pension without a means test. Help us achieve this goal. https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/detail/news/neuer-sozialstaat/10/02/2019/… https://www.dgb.de/themen/++co++9770dc02-4a4d-11e9- 9dda-52540088cada…
It is obvious that Hartz IV is from yesterday and we need a new solution that is future-proof. 1) Those who work must be able to make a living from it. 2) Anyone who cannot work must be adequately secured. And that&#39;s where basic security comes into play.
Probably. look at a counter position again. :) http://bit.ly/2M1FtfR

"We would have liked to have a goodwill, but even then there will always be someone who falls short. It&#39;s not nice for us either. If we had asked for absolute security for everyone, nothing would happen with any political partner."
Are you sure that the social image you have is also correct? These formats on private television channels are staged and exaggerated. Something like this should not be made into the figure of one&#39;s social image.
It should finally be rewarded for its activities in society. Child rearing and care of relatives are taken into account when calculating reference years.
We wouldn&#39;t be so sure about that. There are also voices in the Union to overcome the issue of need testing: http://bit.ly/2HwLKfg
"You mention many points on which we are committed that we will finally grow beyond a purely economic alliance. For example, a minimum tax rate for companies in Europe is one of our concerns or a Europe-wide minimum wage."
... many of our local branches are committed to abolishing daycare fees.
"We make every effort to solve these problems, but they are very likely to be removed from the world, as much as we wish. But where we can do something, we also try. For example, daycare fees ...."
Hi. :) Do you have a specific topic that interests you and on which we can present our concerns?
"Because we are pursuing a long-term goal. We want to think further than always until the next election, because otherwise we are often accused of not having a vision or not looking outside the box. :)"
"We had apparently put the wrong focus on the answer, we apologize. In the event of unemployment, as usual, the employment agency pays the pension insurance contributions for one year, which are required to offset the basic pension."

Can you elaborate on your problem?
And that&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t have to tackle it anyway? That would be very fatalistic.
And we already have an answer to the second video: http://bit.ly/2YJlXGk
"We just checked again: The CDU election program only addresses the taxation of the German economic dream, but here the big digital companies do not pay, for example in Ireland. So no European solution from the Union."
We see it the same way. That is why we voted against it in the European Parliament.
Have you ever looked at what the SPD has done and what we are demanding in the European electoral program?
"Thank you for sharing your story with us - really. Unfortunately, 280 characters are not enough to answer you with dignity. Would you like to send us a short DM so that we can answer you well? Thank you and best regards from the SPD!"
"You can be of your opinion, but even if the factual situation was wrong, which it simply is not; the result of environmental protection would be a world in which you can live a more pleasant life. Because what do trees do besides producing oxygen."

Do you have anything to tell us about the content?
Why that?
Why not the SPD?

have a look here: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/grundrente/… The basic pension will not lead to higher burdens for the contributors. It is also clear that the basic pension is not financed by benefit restrictions elsewhere.

We voted against Article 13.
Hi Vlad! Thank you for being with us. What do you think of the basic pension and the welfare state paper?
"What do you think? Type 13? There are two things in the KoaV: Protection d. Artist and OJ Upload filter, the BReg mostly chose the former."
Are we Mr. Spahn?
"We can only implement our content if we have the majorities. You have to compromise in a coalition, that&#39;s normal."
Look what we will do in 2019: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/…
I beg your pardon? Nothing has been decided yet.
How do you come up with your first assertion?
"We voted against the upload filter in the EP. At the national level, the majority of the cabinet decided on the reform, even if our top candidate Katarina Barley was against it."
What do you mean exactly?
And that was wrong! Schmidt went it alone and ignored the agreed behavior. This does not work this way.
Don&#39;t bet?
Speaking of: see what we do: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/…
We are far from finished :)
You are a very funny one :)

It was we who asked to vote extra on Art13. And those who didn&#39;t get a majority for it.
Definitely! We also do a lot. But we can do more if more of us sit in parliaments.
"We voted against Art13 &amp; really wanted a different result. The KoaV contains both protection artists and OJ. UplFilter. The BReg opted for the former, which KB delivered."
What else should we tell you if it&#39;s the truth?
Thank you ;)
Because we do not rule alone and have to reconcile our interests with the interests of the coalition partner.

Pension law periods due to the receipt of sickness and rehabilitation benefits are also taken into account.
"Since it is an increase in the normal pension, people with a disability pension are also taken into account. The average earnings points are increased by a surcharge only for these times, these are “basic pension assessment times”."
You are absolutely disgusting.

Unfortunately there was a voting error at Gabriele Preuss: she wanted to vote against. So we have 0 pro votes. This is noted in the minutes of the EP. https://twitter.com/SPDEuropa/status/1110545353605029889…
- When it comes to securing peace. - For the fight against climate change and for more environmental protection. - For fair taxation of large companies.
"That is not possible with us. In addition, the German pension insurance does not know such an examination. It is also about the recognition of a lifetime achievement: who has worked a lifetime should not be forced to declare himself before the social welfare office."
Because Anita may have raised her children or cared for aging relatives.
"Does not she. If a community of needs suddenly has higher income, this means that more tax levies have to be paid."
"If we miss something, we apologize, but the answer to which question?"
"We would have liked to have a grace period, but unfortunately we didn&#39;t make it into the coalition agreement."
"The EU should be a bulwark against Islam? Where do they get that from? And, depending on the task of speaking to the right wing, they want to destroy the EU from within. Hence the rejection (plus the usual contemptuous content)."
"To do this, of course, we first have to wait for the results of the European elections. Calling numbers beforehand would be clairvoyance."
Come on
You are right about this: we had to take it with us to get the basic pension in the Koa-V at all. But a) the test cannot be applied to pension rights and the GR falls under it and b) movement seems to come in: http://bit.ly/2HwLKfg
"Please name your sources if you stand against scientifically worked out, documented and discussed knowledge, which makes exactly the opposite clear. https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/…"
We believe that those who have achieved a lot over 35 years deserve recognition. Therefore: # Basic pension now! More information about the basic pension can be found here: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/grundrente/…
"Since then she has worked intermittently as a waitress in a pub 🍻 and then as a taxi driver, who is subject to social security contributions. 🚖 Due to the low earnings, her old-age pension is only € 500. With the # basic pension, it would be € 948. 💰"
"After graduating from high school, she began studying philosophy and German in Göttingen. 📚 After a few years, she stopped studying without a degree. ❌👩🎓"
How exactly does it work with the # basic pension? Here is a very practical and fictional example: Anita is 65 years old and comes from Uslar in Lower Saxony. 👩🦳
We&#39;ll remind him next time to be calmer. :)
"We opposed this reform, the SPD Europe voted against it and we also wanted a different result. Reducing our party to one topic and to a vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."

We stand behind our top candidate with body and soul.
That is exactly why we are calling for a uniform tax base for corporate income tax. So that there is no low tax war between the countries and in the end only the corporations win.

"At the same time, the coalition agreement also includes the protection of artists. The BReg has decided that it finds the most important in this point."
Migration has always existed and we need it too! Take a look at the shortage of skilled workers in e.g. Germany. But this has little to do with the desolate housing situation in Germany.

It is about the recognition of a lifetime achievement - who has worked a lifetime should not be forced to declare himself before the social welfare office.
Pension law periods due to the receipt of sickness and rehabilitation benefits are taken into account.

What does our action have to do with the Rhine or populism?
"An international regulation is important and necessary so that Europe can continue to participate in the competition as a business location. If the proposal is not accepted at the international level, the EU digital tax can still be introduced."
"But we are also the ones who have implemented a minimum training allowance and now want to implement a training place guarantee at European level. In addition, age 16, as in most SPD states."
"The SPD has worked with France over the past few months on a common concept that is now being presented to the OECD so that there are international regulations that prevent tax avoidance by digital corporations, with fair, international competition."
"Mr. Scholz never intended to prevent a digital tax. He has only sought international solutions right from the start, so that Germany will not be left behind by other countries with a national solution."
Your article is from last year. Mr Scholz has now done what he said in the article: Developing a concept that should be applied at an international level by persuading the OECD. This is the only way to ensure fair competition for everyone.

The basic pension is in the coalition agreement.
We want an EU-wide minimum wage of 60% of the median wage. For Germany that&#39;s over € 12. Therefore: choose Sunday SPD :)

The SPD voted against Article 13 and Katarina fought like a lioness in the government.
"Hi Enes! We want a higher minimum wage. Specifically, we want 60% of the median wage, which is more than € 12."
Hi Norman! We think so too. We therefore believe that there must be minimum taxation in the EU.
Hartz IV is really non-metric contemporary. Here is our idea of the new welfare state: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/detail/news/neuer-sozialstaat/10/02/2019/…

Sleep helps!
It doesn&#39;t make it polemical. The concept of taxation was developed by Olaf Scholz with France and is already supported by some within the OECD. Therefore: more than just an election campaign topic. We are optimistic. 😉
Thank you! We give everything for it :)
"Of course we know that! However, we think that some points are too national. Our MEP Tiemo Wölken has made a video, look here: https://youtu.be/79d9X16w8zc"

"Introduce financial transaction tax in the EU. We are taking the first step by taxing transactions on shares issued domestically. The revenue of this tax should flow to the EU. However, this is only the first step. Our goal remains a 3/4"
It is high time that existing blockades are overcome and that we finally enforce this tax on justice. We made a new start together with France. We want a financial transaction tax based on the model of the French. 2.4
"Exactly! Therefore, in our European electoral program we demand: &quot;Introduce financial transaction tax. Since 2010, the subject of financial transaction tax has been on the agenda in Europe, especially under pressure from our Socialist Group in the European Parliament ... 1/4"
Your article is over a year old. Mr. Scholz developed the concept of taxing digital companies together with France as a consequence of all tax avoidance. International solutions are needed for fair competition.

"Since it is almost a surcharge on the existing pension, a disability pension has no influence on the basic pension."
Hi Breeze! Why that?
There is no unsolidarity in ensuring that people who have cared for relatives and raised children are adequately cared for in old age. A service to society must not be a punishment.
"Why? The degrading walk to office must be avoided so that people can also see the benefits. In addition, the Deutsche Rentenversicherung that pays the pension does not know such an examination."

"The SPD Eu voted against, we also wanted a different result. Reducing our party to a vote in the EP doesn&#39;t help. Better work with us zsm, so that more SPD MPs sit in the EP during the votes! 😉"
There is also the fact that complex questions cannot always be broken down to a yes or no. This is shown most clearly by the consequences of the Brexit vote.
"We are therefore still firmly committed to parliamentary democracy with elected representatives, who are practicing this balancing act."
"And the experience of recent years shows that voting at national level always leads to the same result, namely that the voters are not representative of the population."
The question of referendums comes up again and again and the basic question is also a very important one: How do representation and participation stand in a democracy?

What is your statement based on?
"Joa, our Jusos are rightly positioned against right-wing sentiments. The visual language may be criticized, the message is clear. Since our Jusos are also not known for physical violence, you do not have to put this on the gold scale."

The point is that the European Union needs the most convinced Europeans. It is not a competition.
. @ katarinabarley in @ZDF: We are currently fighting very hard with the Union for a climate protection law. But #climate protection is also a social issue. We have to give people perspectives. Only the SPD brings together climate protection and social issues.💪 #Europe is the answer #wasmireuropabring
The coalition has also been terminated in #Burgenland!
And?
how could we not support you :)
We use taxes to narrow the gap between rich and poor. Here we use them to enable an unconditional basic pension so that pensioners do not have to live in poverty.

Katarina gives up her post as Federal Minister for Europe. #servicetweet
Then you could also happen to be someone who was born in Germany and are at home on Earth. :)
Please stop inciting retirees against migrants. The basic pension will not lead to higher burdens for the contributors.

The principle is actually quite simple: anyone who has paid into the pension fund for at least 35 years should get more pension than someone who has never worked. In other words: #social junk! https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-541993.html…
The new welfare state is the decision of the party executive: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Bilder/SPDerneuern/201902_PV-Klausur/20190210_Neuer_Sozialstaat.pdf…

"We see that a brutalization has taken place every day, but only to blame politicians is one-dimensional. Each individual must be called upon to respect social standards. Whether online or offline."
"&quot;There is no means test for the basic pension. The pension should be financed entirely from tax funds.

# Basic pension: This means recognition of lifetime achievement. That means: more money for around three million pensioners - including 80 percent women. All information: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/grundrente…
What is questionable about Article 5? The task of the Basic Law is to define the basic rules of the game in our society. We measure ourselves against this.
"And on the subject of wage dumping: For example, we plan to report subcontractor liability to the courier industry, so that subcontractors, for example, no longer fail to meet their social security obligations with impunity."

It is obvious that Hartz IV is from yesterday. For us this means 2 things: 1) Whoever works must be able to make a living from it. 2) Anyone who cannot work must be adequately secured. And that&#39;s where basic security comes into play.

What? Fair taxation of corporations? Europ. Minimum wage? What are you doing? https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/…
How did you get that?
On the subject of a basic pension: the SPD wants EVERYONE to receive a basic pension once they have paid in for 35 years. The CDU doesn&#39;t want that. An example of many.
"That is 1. correct and 2. also a good thing. You are talking exclusively about the details for the first time. In any case, we are not worried about a lack of critical questions ... 😉"
"Right to return part-time full-time, ban on cooperation, modernization of infrastructure, free education at daycare college, rent brake, minimum pension &amp; trainee allowance, minimum wage, parity KV contributions, housing construction. All ducks."
How do you get the nonsense?
"Not wrong, but everyone should also be capable of abstraction and such a picture really doesn&#39;t have to be put on the gold scales."

"Yes moin, you again :) The majority of our members voted to go into a grand coalition. We never promised anything about Art13, but we voted against it in the EP."
So the SPD voted against the upload filter in the EP.
"Hi jothaka! We want to introduce the minimum wage at European level. Our goal is 60% of the median wage, which is around € 12 for Germany. You have to choose SPD on Sunday."

Katarina is committed to agreeing a minimum level of taxation to ensure that everyone makes a fair contribution to the financing of government tasks. With this we put a lower limit in order to prevent tax competition downwards.
The SPÖ has decisions that preclude cooperation with the FPÖ. This was ignored in Burgenland. Good thing that new elections will be held soon!

"It is about the recognition of a lifetime achievement - who has worked a lifetime should not be forced to declare himself before the social welfare office. In addition, the German pension insurance, which pays the pension does not know such an examination. :)"

Ready or is there more?
"Criticism is of course justified, but just scolding doesn&#39;t help. What would you like to want? If we learn this, we could incorporate it into our policies. :)"

Who benefits from the # basic pension and how is it financed? A short summary also at BILD. https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/politik-inland/spd-plan-grundrente-soll-jaehrlich-4-millillion-euro-kosten-62085684.bild.html… pic.twitter.com/L2iPNM4Blq

We are great! 😍 https://twitter.com/CitySPD/status/1130907395696275457…
The main thing is history.
"Then ask him your questions, maybe. we have one or the other answer."
"We opposed this reform, the SPD Europe voted against it and we also wanted a different result. Reducing our party to one topic and to a vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."

Misinterpret intentional?
The question is: basic pension instead of &quot;Mövenpick tax&quot;. We have an idea what you would choose 😛
Why? Where exactly are you bumping into? :)
"By the way, we are the largest party in Germany :)"
This picture is very simply exaggerated in its expression. One can only over-interpret it as willful and with malicious intent.
For our actions here: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/… 💪💪💪💪
because of we keep nothing: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/… :) and to article 13: the SPD has voted against it.
Not really? Just one of our many topics. :)
Don&#39;t bet :)
Hi Michael! It&#39;s our turn!
"It is about the simple &quot;tolerance paradox&quot;. We are 90% tolerant. The last 10% is reserved for those who would take advantage of the given tolerance to abolish it. Therefore, this line is drawn there."

"But we live in a democracy, with democratic processes. We also have to comply with applicable law. There is an approval for glyphosate in Europe, which is valid until 2023. Before that, it can hardly be stopped."
"Right of return Part-time full-time, ban on cooperation, modernization of infrastructure, free education from kindergarten to university, minimum pension &amp; trainee allowance, minimum wage, parity KV contributions, housing construction. May I help you!"
Become a blatant thing :)
"At the moment it looks more like you are looking for the argument, but no, of course you would not. We would discuss our differences. :)"
Yes indeed. The tenant can then claim overpaid rent.
"Exaggerated topic, because our Jusos are known for no violence. Just an exaggerated representation."
So one last time: do you have a substantive question? Is there a basic topic that is close to your heart or do you want to know something more?
"We have nothing against sensible criticism. Your contributions are very far from that. Hardly any content-related questions, but usually troll comments in which all content is missing. Not to mention the verbal attacks against parts of our party."
"Yes, we still want them. But you can&#39;t do that with 20%. We think that&#39;s stupid. But that&#39;s how democracy works."
You were careful! The show runs today on ZDF :) #ServiceTweet
"But this is not about taxes. But also about social security for pension, unemployment and health insurance. Or the levy for the church."
Isn&#39;t that our requirement?
"We have a specific position against glyphosate and are convinced that it is harmful to humans, animals and plants. That is why our program also includes: pic.twitter.com/tZs1LPKzUi"

And? Each party and group has its black sheep. How to deal with them is your question. And the FPÖ planned to abolish Austria&#39;s democracy.
"Each party has its problems, nobody denies that, but the FPÖ apparently wanted to sell Austria to the highest bidder."
"The criticism is not directed at states, but also at anti-democratic parties."
"What are you writing there please? The Union opened its election campaign shortly and it brought the right-wing populists into the government, the Union regularly invites people like Orban and and and ... https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/plus192510323/Lars -Klingbeil-The-Conservatives-will-not-save-Europe.html…"
"Mistakes made by people from our party that are inexcusable, but therefore we shouldn&#39;t draw attention to the dangers posed by right-wing populists?"
But on the contrary. Social democracy is needed more than ever.
Unfortunately yes and therefore you have to position yourself against them from the start.

"Hi Sebastian! Anyone can choose their beliefs freely, and that&#39;s what we Social Democrats stand for"
Hi Sebastian! That is why there is a principle in Germany that grants everyone their religious freedom as long as they do not restrict anyone else. And that&#39;s good

"Hi, paradise! Such grievances must be uncovered!"
"Is not it. If you consume in a climate-friendly way, you could a) avoid the costs of the tax and b) get the citizens back in part. The model for us is the model in Switzerland."
"The CO2 tax should not a) serve to burden people more. The introduction of this tax will support those products that are produced in a more climate-friendly way, are therefore cheaper and, in the end, are more likely to be purchased."
"Hi Hturtinim! No, that is wrong! But then they also have to prove where their children are disadvantaged. Incitement sounds like this: &quot;People group XX should sink into the sea&quot; or &quot;back to where it belongs&quot;, etc. This is incitement."
"Hi Hturtinim! This is a very specific regulation, in which the states and schools are responsible for the regulation. In general, we can only note that all holidays relevant to Christians are already free."

Hi Thommy! What should we do as a party if we don&#39;t represent our interests?
"Politics means finding compromises and uniting society behind them. For example, when we talk about climate policy, it turns out that we are asking for CO2 pricing and that this will result in massive headwinds from society. 2.3"

Hi Susanne! We agree that the EU can do a few things better. But we can only tackle this if we do not divide the EU

Do it and more: The coalition in Burgenland has been dissolved and therefore new elections are also pending there.
"We have to accept that, because our attitude of not supporting anyone with extremist views is immovable."

"No more. The government was dissolved. Accordingly, there is also a new election."
OK. But hacky sacks are fine?
"a) The SPD MPs voted unanimously against the ordinance and b) Ms. Merkel made use of her competence in directives, so Katarina had to agree, however unsatisfactory it is."
"We know that our vision of a strong Europe is ambitious, we have to overcome resistance. There are political forces for which Europe is not the answer, but who seek salvation in the return to selfishness and nationalism."
It is obvious that Hartz IV is from yesterday and we finally need new solutions that are future-proof. That is why we have developed the new welfare state. More information is available here: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Bilder/SPDerneuern/201902_PV-Klausur/20190210_Neuer_Sozialstaat.pdf…

"With regard to the coalition agreement, that&#39;s one of those things. Because it also says that we will implement a European copyright reform. So the rejection would also have been a coalition breach."
We are trying hard all the time and now a little more 😉 Greetings
This also means that the consequences are shown. When @TimmermansEU said in #tvDuell that he wanted to ban short-haul flights. We got a shit storm.
"None of us voted for it. Our group has tabled an amendment. With @woelken we have one of the fighters in our ranks. In the EU Council, it is not people who vote according to their conscience, but governments by agreement. 2.2"
"Honestly? Yes, we are not innocent. But also that this legislative process ran over 2 years and nobody was interested in it. When interest fell, we supported demos and decided against upload filters. 1.2"
"Tonight, 9:00 p.m .: Turn on @First! @AndreaNahlesSPD at the &#39;Summit Europe - the party leaders in conversation&#39;. Join the discussion under #Europe is the answer. 😀 pic.twitter.com/ZIQspZfkKA"
"Of course, we are not free from mistakes, nobody claims that. But of course we also want to discuss our view of things."
"No, that&#39;s not right, even among the 18-24 year olds only 47% are in favor of a CO2 tax, in total 62% of Germans are against it. There is lobbying, of course, but it is not solely the fault of climate protection. https://www.zeit.de/news/2019-05/10/vor-allem-aeltere-lehnen-co2-steuer-fuer-klimaschutz-ab-190510-99-158419…"

Hi Hans! We give our best. How we want to advance climate protection: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anantwort/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf…

Na klar.
The SPD wants to change this: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Bilder/SPDerneuern/201902_PV-Klausur/20190210_Neuer_Sozialstaat.pdf….
Who knows.. ;)
Is it something specific? Should we ask again?

"This is called inclusion. If you don&#39;t feel addressed by this variant, you can count yourself lucky."
"We are well over 400,000 people, do you really want that?"
"Hi, hairy sausage gurgler! We want to make Europe better, that&#39;s what we stand for. This includes, for example, a higher minimum wage. You can read what else we want here: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Bilder/SPDerneuern/201902_PV-Klausur/20190210_Neuer_Sozialstaat.pdf…. Best regards!"

Hi Ali! it is important that there is an opposite pole
"Hi Ali! Absolutely not. When I see a video on YouTube that explains that milk is stupid and fog is poisonous, it is quite good that the ÖR has a children&#39;s program that invalidates this, but the ÖR does not need its own YouTube channel."
"Hi, Friedhelm! We see it similarly to you and have therefore developed the new welfare state. If you like, you can get more information about our performances here: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Bilder/SPDerneuern/201902_PV-Klausur/20190210_Neuer_Sozialstaat.pdf…"

"Who, if not we?"
European elections are on Sunday. #ServiceTweet
"We can only do that if we have the majorities for it. For the minimum taxation of companies, citizens have to choose SPD on Sunday."
"Hi, FxM! Where exactly is the problem here? The SPD demands a tax for large corporations and you take that as an opportunity to take action against it? Where does a disadvantage arise when large corporations are taxed?"
"Hi Ali! We see it differently. The ÖR does not have to compete with the private media in every area, but has to ensure that there is also an information option outside of it."
We want minimum taxation everywhere in the European Union. More information is available in our European election program: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anonse/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf…
Hi Hans-sama! We also like to review criticism of us from the AfD. Until there were only a few things that appeared to us to be hand-held after examination
"Hi Hans-sama! They wanted articles on topics that were relevant recently. In our opinion, climate change seems to be the same"
"Hi Hans-sama! Since the criticism is already known, shouldn&#39;t we list it? Isn&#39;t that the definition of not critical?"
Hi Hans-sama! Our logic is that two bodies made up of different people offer very little potential for corruption. How would you do it? No committee?
"Hey Peter, why?"
"Hi Maria! We have achieved a lot in the past years. You can read what will change in 2019, for example: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/…"

"Right of return full-time part-time, cooperation ban, free education from daycare to university, price brake, minimum pension &amp; trainee allowance, minimum wage, parity KV contributions, model declaratory judgment. Nothing accomplished? 💪"

A Europe where you can live in peace and freedom if you want to be part of it. :)
And?
Do you have to be offensive? What is your concern?
.. then Belgian waffles will fit four hours later :-)!
What topics would you like to see?
"What? We campaigned against this reform, the S&amp;D voted against it, we also wished for a different result. Reducing our party to one topic and to one vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."

"Hi, guerrilla chef! http://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/inland/rundfunk-107.html… we had already linked in a similar debate, but thanks for pointing it out!"
The coalition in Burgenland was dissolved. So there are also new elections.
"@ flash1177 We opposed Art. 13, we also wanted a different result. Reducing ourselves to a vote in the EP doesn&#39;t help. You better work with us zsm, so that more SPD MPs sit in the EP during the votes."
"Hi, STEINER! We are surprised by this level of discussion. Would you also want everyone who doesn&#39;t have your opinion to do the same with you?"
Hi Wolfgang! What does that have to do with it now?
"@langhaar_andy But it doesn&#39;t bring anything to step back if something doesn&#39;t suit you. If he had resigned, there would have been a risk of new elections and would have been busy again. In these circumstances, the country and the EU would not move forward either."
"Hi, Manuela! 👍"
"We can and there is not much that can be changed about the current balance of power, at least not without causing general unrest again."

Which truth?
"But it also brings nothing to step back permanently if something does not suit you. If he had resigned, there would have been a risk of new elections and would have been busy again. In these circumstances, the country and the EU would not move forward either."
"Hi Ulla! It should be called Creutzfeldt &amp; Jakob. An illness in which the impaired mental faculties are impaired, such as memory loss or impaired perception. Do you want to tell us something specific?"
"We opposed the reform, S&amp;D voted against it and we also wanted a different result. Reducing our party to one topic and to a vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."
"Hi, DrEckspatz! Would you like to contribute something constructively, or is that it?"
Hi Fritz! And what facts were faked here?
"Hi, media watch! The coalition in Linz was terminated."
What exactly would you like to see for topics that should become the focus of the party again?
"Are you okay What you assume is not the order of the media. But if the reporting leads the ÖVP to end the coalition with the FPÖ, then it is legitimate. No wonder with the content of this video."
"Hi, monsieur! Fortunately, not everyone has the same sense of humor, but the fact that people are campaigning for more turnout is nothing reprehensible, is it?"
Would you have a suggestion on how to get a counterweight? Smaller states like Malta or Estonia stand up to the increasing external pressure? The nation state alone no longer offers any solutions.
Our info truck stops in Munich today. Come together and discuss from 4pm with @katarinabarley and @NataschaKohnen at Belgian waffles about our ideas for Europe! Our 5-point plan: https://link.spd.de/5PointsSozialesEuropa… #Waffles are the answer #Europa is the answer
Then we can also live with it. :)

"Your link does not work, so we can’t respond well to it."
"Hi Maria! We see it like you: Hartz IV is from yesterday, that&#39;s why we developed the new welfare state. More information here: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Bilder/SPDerneuern/201902_PV-Klausur/20190210_Neuer_Sozialstaat.pdf…"
"One can argue, of course, whether this contribution of our Jusos has succeeded too well, but pulling them out of it is more than exaggerated. We hope you are just as critical of all other articles on the Internet. :)"
Are you okay? Can we help?
"Hello Andreas, @mueller_andi @katarinabarley Hello Andreas, what do you think?"
"Hi, forest! Do you also have evidence for your allegations or are you only here to mob?"
"Glances sometimes say more than a thousand words :-) Katarina has said a lot in terms of content, if you like, you can look it up in the media library. Otherwise, there are almost 80 pages of electoral program: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anantwort/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf…."
"No, how do you come up with the idea?"
"Hi Andreas! We campaigned against this reform, voted against it and wished for a different result. Why don&#39;t you work with us so that more SPD MPs sit in the European Parliament? :)"
"Hi Jani! Without the immigrants from the 1960s, there would have been no such economic upswing in Germany."
Would you like to participate constructively in the debate or is it enough for you to build such fantasy constructions?
"Hi Peter! You can see what Katarina said in the debate in the ARD media library. Of course, were more than looks! ;-)"
"Hi, eutschGerman! How should we be an enemy of Europe if our goal is a social Europe? We want freedom and protection for all people living in Europe"
With your own advertising slogans such as &quot;Austria leads the way&quot; there is probably a close connection. https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/bedeutung-fuer-die-afd-nach-dem-ende-der-koalition-in-wien-16196908.html…
Do you also have something to contribute to the debate or is an insult in the political debate enough for you?
European election campaigns are made with such content: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anantwort/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf…
Are you crazy? How do you come up with such an assertion?
"Hi, Derjoschi! That politicians are not allowed to influence reporting, we fully agree with you. Nevertheless, we see the situation in Germany still far from &quot;controlled reporting&quot; or an ÖR that is &quot;lazy to the core&quot;"
We&#39;re just wondering who did the research here? We do not yet know that @MartinSchulz has recently become our top candidate
"We campaigned against this reform, the SPD Eu voted against it. Reducing ourselves to a vote in the EP doesn&#39;t help. Better work with us zsm, so that more of the SPD sit in the EP when voting."
And? It happened and Norbert Rüthers was convicted.
Hi Monkey! How would you want to finance an ÖR without depending on private investors?
"Hi Marcel! No, we are quite certain that we see an institution that is independent of private investors and is &quot;paid&quot; by all citizens as the basis of a democracy. We rather ask how opinion would have been directed in Austria"
"We campaigned against this reform, the SPD Eu voted against it. Reducing ourselves to a vote in the EP doesn&#39;t help. Better work with us zsm, so that more of the SPD sit in the EP when voting."
Have a look here: https://www.bundestag.de/resource/blob/557014/7e164d071a4a535dfb6bb4efdd5bca2c/wd-7-069-18-pdf-data.pdf… The conclusion (p.13) could be particularly interesting for you his.
"Context is the word of the hour here. The Jusos are not known to use violence. One cannot say that of the IB, for example."
"You are right about the fact that the creation itself is probably illegal, but the content of the video, from the point of view of the creator and the public, justifies its creation and publication. We expressed ourselves unclearly."
"Probably, but the creator of the video would have to be determined first."
Katarina&#39;s expertise is indisputable and as a politician you have to be reluctant to deal with judicial issues. Called separation of powers.
"No fact at all, or do you know more than anyone else? So much is unknown: source, circumstances, protagonists"
"Thank you, but we already know why we write and say &quot;pensioners&quot;. https://editionf.com/anatol-stefanowitsch-eine-frage-der-moral-politsch-korrekte-gendergerechte-sprache…"
We are sure that Andrea paid very good attention at school. The fact that she comments on this topic does not rule out the possibility. :)
What kind of statement would you have wished for? That is an ongoing procedure. It is a good thing that politics does not comment on this. This is called separation of powers.
Do you have a source to support this claim?
Nobody has generalized against the citizens of Austria. And please don&#39;t be offensive. Thank you :)
"Hi, Achim! We just love to have fun in life, and probably a urologist too"
"Hi Alexander! Fortunately, there are free and fair elections in Germany. You can choose what you want. However, we recommend the SPD 😉"

The coalition in Burgenland was dissolved. So there are also new elections.
Can we take a look at her crystal ball? :)
"We voted unanimously, but the parliamentary majority ended up voting in favor."
"Hi, basic! The ÖR has no influence, which is blocked by Youtub after verification, since YouTube is a private company that is not subject to the ÖR."
"Hi, Uwe! Violence is not a solution - whether against right or left extremes. We are convinced that the baseball bat here has only metaphorical characters."
Sorry?
"Freedom of expression means first of all that you can have your opinion. That doesn&#39;t mean we have to respond to every tweet. By the way, we often don&#39;t make it due to time constraints. It has nothing to do with &quot;uncomfortable&quot; things."
Hi Abbas! Not always true: whoever screams the loudest is right. Our community prefers to go on the streets for # 1EuropafuerAll.
"@ragingpixelshow Hi,! We believe it is the conservatives who regularly work with right-wing populists like Orbán and who serve as stirrup holders."
"Hi, Derjoschi! You can&#39;t think of democracy without an ÖR. A medium that can act independently of private investors as the ÖR does is the cornerstone of a free democracy"
"Hi, Donkey_Schotte! We don&#39;t want to do away with Germany, but we know that if we want growth and security, we all need Europe. We need a social Europe, for people, not for corporations."
"Hi Hans! We believe that nationalists and conservatives divide Europe. Without Europe, we will have no chance in the international market against major powers like China, Russia and the United States. We can only assert ourselves together."
The European idea is the answer to the big tasks of the future. They can only be solved together. When it comes to securing peace. For the fight against climate change and for more environmental protection. For fair taxation of large companies.

We see a Facebook content that could have been better and the Jusos can speak well for themselves.
"We campaigned against this reform, the SPD Europe voted against it and we also wanted a different result. Reducing ourselves to one topic and to a vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."
"Yes, there is much to criticize about the Turkish government, but talking is better than silence. After two difficult years, the then Foreign Minister Sigmar had resumed dialogue with the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu in early 2018."

unfortunately unfortunately ....
"We campaigned against this reform, the SPD Europe voted against it and we also wanted a different result. Reducing ourselves to one topic and to a vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."
A concrete example among these allegations?
The coalition in Burgenland was disbanded and should also be re-elected there.
Correctly recorded;)
"We campaigned against this reform, the SPD Europe voted against it and we also wanted a different result. Reducing ourselves to one topic and to a vote in the EP (where we voted against Art. 13 as I said) does not help."
"If you find a video of such a conversation, we are really excited."
"If you say that, it will be true."
This is exactly the EXACT statement of the picture. No emblematic or exaggerated. You have captured the content perfectly. (Irony off)
Would you have a source for this statement?

Right-wing extremism must never be the answer.
We can only implement our policies if the citizens give us their trust. Therefore: go vote on Sunday and vote for the SPD - for a strong social democracy in Europe.
Hi stephan The difference is that we clearly differentiate ourselves from anti-democratic forces! :)

Of course it is relevant for us what is happening in our neighboring country! For Germany and Europe.

"That&#39;s not true. There is an empty space in tax law because taxation has so far been local, which is why digital companies are falling apart. We will now close this empty space."

"No, the baker around the corner already pays taxes and can sell his rolls at a fair price.If a company only keeps going because it doesn&#39;t pay taxes, there is something wrong with the business model &amp; the profit then pays the little baker"

Here you are guided by the local comparative rent. The rent may not be more than 10 percent higher.
"That&#39;s not true. Tell that to separate parents, who of course don&#39;t move away because of their children. Or employees whose employers are located in cities."
With what reason from you can you only talk about the rent brake if there is enough living space overall? Why &quot;either or&quot;? Why does one only work when the other has happened? We have to tackle that now! Living is now too expensive!
"If you mean, whoever worked for the minimum wage for years and then won it, even if it was too low, and since then has been working to increase and increase it - yes, then: SPD."
As democrats we see it differently. https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/afd-verfassungsschutz-1.4288538…
Good point. This works via the standard local rent. The comparison between different cities is therefore not drawn at all.

"Mr. Scholz has developed this concept together with France over the past few months. So it&#39;s not just falling from the sky now. Together it will be presented to the OECD so that there are global solutions. It&#39;s naive, it&#39;s politics."
"Aha? Nice picture, especially the color is nice, but 1) it&#39;s nonsense and 2) what&#39;s the argument now?"
"Has nothing to do with the NetzDG, research first, then tweet"
Mr. Scholz has spent the past few months working with France to develop this concept of taxing digital companies. It is now to be proposed to the OECD so that it can serve as a global solution. It started long before the election campaign.
And that should mean that we can&#39;t do that now?
You misunderstand. The point is that the concept that Mr Scholz developed together with France is proposed to the OECD and should serve as a uniform solution there.
"So you are against giant digital companies such as Google, Apple and Co. that determine the global player market being appropriately taxed? Instead, should they continue to avoid taxes?"
"Mr. Scholz has been working with France for months on this concept of minimum taxation, which was presented last week at the international tax symposium. So long before the election campaign for the European elections."
"We are not watching. Together with France, Olaf Scholz has developed the concept of minimum taxation for digital companies and is working to convince the OECD of this.

1. You will probably not find a party with whom you agree 100% with every political decision and then this may also be the wrong standard of politics. 2. Did our Members in Parliament vote against the reform? It is not a will.

"For people who want or need to live in the city, solutions such as the rent brake are still needed. Just because a political concept does not solve all the problems that exist in the huge subject area of &quot;living&quot; does not make it unnecessary. Your wrong approach."
"No, we didn&#39;t deliberately misunderstand that. We made it clear that Mr. Kühnert has the flu and was therefore unable to participate in the program."
What should it look like if the rent cannot rise?
What is the disrespectful naughtiness of you to talk about other people? Cold sweats can sometimes occur with flu like Kevin. Politicians are also only people who can get sick at times.

"Look right: It is about introducing a minimum wage across the EU, it goes beyond the borders of the FRG and is holistic."
What shoud that? Just explain why you think raising the minimum wage is a bad idea instead of posting it.
"What are you writing there? Zero arguments, a little bit of agitation and in the end the worst election recommendation ... you don&#39;t normally object to something like that?"
"Unfortunately, this applies above all to your comments under our tweets ... we have been looking for a debate with you for some time, mostly nothing comes."
The minimum wage should be based on 60% of the median income in the respective country so that you can live from your work in all EU countries #Europe is the answer
"You say it right, the AfD account is completely devoid of measure, decency and courtesy ... not to mention political arguments. Unfortunately, we experience this from accounts of this association again and again."

I beg your pardon?
Nice that you still left a comment here :)
"Hm, what are you writing? What are you referring to? Or is it just a sentence that you cut out and hope nobody contradicts?"
Now they mix it up. The European minimum wage would make up 60 percent of the country-specific median wage in each member state. In Germany that is 12 euros.
"In addition, a European minimum wage would not be 12 euros in every member state. It would be based on the median wages of the respective country and make up 60 percent of it."
And how do you come up with that? As a stirrup holder for right-wing populists?

"o_0 Madness, the debates with you are worthwhile :) A solid immigration law is also the basis for successful integration"
What are you writing there? Migration has been taking place in D for at least decades and is therefore an immigration country. No capslock can help
Sorry? You read what is in the tweet: Immigration Act https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2019/kw19-de-fachkraefteeinwanderung-640406…
Yes. The word says that immigrants are migrants.
All the more important that people see that something like this does not go unchallenged 💪 💪 And thank you for your strong support &lt;3

Who are we going to silence?
@ danielm08407507 @katarinabarley Such absolute nonsense. We are speechless. If we only concentrate on the topic of this thread: Do you really think that the media in D are aligned?
Are you serious?
It&#39;s good that we have enough of our own members who can discuss which utopias have room and which don&#39;t.
"Then just be happy, this is probably not going to be a meaningful debate anymore. LG"
You can find our program here: http://bit.ly/2VDh7wA Spoiler: There is no expropriation.
This is exactly what our European program says: https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/steuergerechtigkeit/…
"Aha, why do you think that?"
Just because you choose one party doesn&#39;t it mean that you hate the others? This is a very crude theory that you have there.

"Yes, it&#39;s bad when people smile ... Unraveling would help here. ;)"
Different people deal with it differently. But we find this historical way in which this party pursues politics dangerous for democracy.
"For us it definitely does not mean turning away from the right of asylum. But a fair distribution in Europe, both of asylum seekers and of costs and obligations."
"Hach, Steffen &lt;3"
"But you don&#39;t mean immigration policy, but asylum policy. And of course you need a price change there, but from our point of view it probably looks different than you imagine."

Yes of course. We are also looking forward to the conversation. But you also have to understand that we want good election results for our convictions and not just to sit in any parliament.
"Think about why you and a few others make up the bulk of the negative comments here on Twitter. Even if social media is something incredibly great, you should never forget that it is not representative."
"&quot;Despite a compromise proposal from Germany and France, the EU finance ministers could not agree on the early introduction of a digital tax.&quot; https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/digitalsteuer-deutsche-franzoesischer-vorschlag-scheitert-a-1241979.html…"

So nothing more to contribute in terms of content?
"Oh Till, we both know that you have a topic close to your heart that we thought was wrong. It&#39;s not that we&#39;re resistant to criticism, we like to enter into a discourse. best regards"
Totally meaningful so completely out of context. Nothing else to do except rushing?
"Well, it&#39;s primarily about the implementation in national law. And indeed the laws still have to be written."
"There is no plan for this, but it is also unlikely: even if we do not like the result of the vote, it was a democratic vote by Parliament that we must respect"
1) It is about the use of taxes and the investment in the citizens of the EU. Neither in taxes nor in investments in people is wrong 2) We would like to point out once again the fair taxation of digital companies;)

"Oh, Klaus ... We asked you several times today to come up with something substantive, constructive or just an argument ... I suppose nothing comes from you"
. @ udobullmann at #spdpk: A social #Europe needs fair taxation of large companies. Global tech giants like Amazon &amp; Co in particular make billions in profits and hardly pay taxes. That must be the end! #EuropaistdieAntwort

Orban also belongs to the EPP. The CDU wants to work with him. We definitely won&#39;t!
😢
"Especially when it comes to taxes, we fully say: yes. (P. 14: https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anantwort/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf…)"
At least we try to convince you. Because: We believe in it!
It&#39;s just not true. Have a look for yourself what we have already achieved in 2019: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/…
That&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s all about: a European. The minimum wage depends on the income in the respective country and would mean D € 12 in Germany
Was?

- When it comes to securing peace. - For the fight against climate change and for more environmental protection. - For a social shaping of globalization that prevents workers from being played off against each other. (2)
We love these tweets &lt;3 The European idea is the answer to the great challenges of the present and the future. They can only be solved together. We Social Democrats want Europe to finally translate its economic strength into political strength: (1/2)

What are you writing there? The attack on freedom of the press in Austria is more than obvious and what the conservatives are currently doing has to be named!

And that is our answer: https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/steuergerechtigkeit/…
The main thing is that people who work online have uniform standards. On every platform.
"And don&#39;t be angry with us, but we still have a few other comments to make. We will definitely see each other again here. Have a nice sunny May 1st. Friendship."
Of course not. But we are promoting a common path in Europe.

"For the time being, it&#39;s about standing by our beliefs and explaining them. Of course, to win people over with it. But just being elected is not an end in itself."
That is why we are also demanding reforms from the EU. It&#39;s not like we say that everything that comes from the EU is good. But basically we think we need a strong EU in a globalized world.
"Right of return part-time full-time, ban on cooperation, modernization of infrastructure, free education from daycare to university, price brake, minimum pension &amp; training allowance, minimum wage, parity KV contributions, housing construction ..."
It&#39;s good!
A little more enthusiasm! We also read all of your comments and those of others.
Because?
Is this your constructive contribution to the debate?
You can ring the bell and you will always receive a push message.
You asked what we did.
"Right to return part-time full-time, ban on cooperation, modernization of infrastructure, free education from daycare to university, price brake, training allowance, minimum wage, parity KV contributions, housing construction ..."
Where is it particularly painful?
That is your opinion.

Please read correctly: It is just a question of combining the climate goals with social equilibrium: &quot;Politicians must&quot; make sure that the socially disadvantaged do not pay the price &quot;.&quot;
Such comments are annoying. Do you have any arguments or do you just want to poison the climate of debate with wild claims? Here is a little something to read: https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/… https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert / ...

"And there is the next vague comment;) If you take a look at the debates here in the comments, it shows that we are discussing on an equal footing. What you do is disrupt the content"
And is that why your answer is a party that uses illegal party donations?
"The reason is in the last paragraph: It is not the intention to harm the restaurant, but the AfD meetings will not be left uncommented, but will be answered with demonstrations."
"Oh Peter, everyone can see that you are not ready to discuss, but to hide behind vague and vague statements and want to disturb them. Have you got nothing better to do on such a nice day?"
We want a European minimum wage that is based on the average wage in the respective country. In Germany that would be € 12. LG
Are you sure you&#39;d better get away from there?
Didn&#39;t we have these discussions before the introduction of the minimum wage in Germany? And what is now?
"No, rather: go to the polling station!"

Could you express your criticism of the letter? A youth organization campaigns against forces that want to abolish our open society and call on other citizens to participate. Sounds a lot like defensive democracy 💪💪

"Huh, sure! Have a look: https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/…"

"It was just in the debate about consumer protection and food, we reject the uncontrolled release of genetically manipulated plants, it is here: https://www.spdfraktion.de/themen/gr%C3%BCne-gentechnik ..."
"No, that&#39;s nonsense."
"Not correct! The point is that the conservatives show mild resistance to the right, that their European politicians have long since ceased to be in good shape and that a strong social democracy is therefore needed #Europe is the answer"
"Hm, that&#39;s a bit difficult for us now, what exactly do you mean? For example, we want a minimum wage law for the EU where D would come to € 12. That&#39;s great, isn&#39;t it?"
Born...
What are you writing there? An economy that benefits people is the only one we need in Europe #Europe is the answer https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/…

"With all due respect, inviting these activists is not a laughing stock."
"🙄🙄 Are you now interested in finding democratic solutions? Here is a small list from 2019 fyi: right of return part-time full-time, ban on cooperation. Minimum wage, parity KV contributions, model declaratory action https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/…"
But @katarinabarley does a really good job in consumer protection and also in tenant protection. What exactly have you wished for over the past few years that have been so bitterly disappointed?
@ gulbi56 @luisamneubauer @volksentscheid We are currently inviting a non-partisan movement 😉 To the referendums at federal level: We are clearly committed to parliamentary democracy. But there is room for movements like #fff
"Real climate protection, yes, and this has to be put into law. But the devil is often in the details. That is why it is the right first step to meet and clarify possible pitfalls."
Why do you let yourself be lulled by such slogans? How do you make sure that nothing happens? A lot is happening right now.
"The bigger the majority, the more blatant the law and the beginning is the talk :)"
"The answer is very clear: the SPD is a party and thus active as a social actor. Accordingly, our positions are partisan."
This is a very important part of our European program: &quot;Europe is aiming for a seat on the United Nations Security Council (UN)&quot; (p. 62) https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anantwort/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf ...
We&#39;ll be happy to return that;) And now look for another place to clumsily disturb.
"Aha, and your arguments about it? Have a look here: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was-sich-2019-aendert/…"
On it: https://www.vorwaerts.de/artikel/spd-ag-fordert-mehr-menschen-behinderung-parlamente …
What are you writing there?
And we also tackled a lot and made progress in all political fields. And the debate about Agenda 2010 - which you are probably interested in - has since been heavily discussed in the party. But now it&#39;s about the future
Now don&#39;t pretend that this is something mysterious ... These foundations have existed since the 1950s https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parteinahe_Stiftung ...
"Well, that&#39;s not true: We negotiated the climate goals in Paris, increased the values of the CO emissions to be reduced against great resistance in the EP and, unlike some other parties, we stand by our goals even if we are in the government"
But that&#39;s the first step in a democracy;) That&#39;s why it&#39;s very important and right.
", 🤔 So here in Berlin the activists from #FFF have been to @spdrlp several times, the position is no different. Have you ever contacted the national association directly?"
"And as a junior partner, we did a lot. But this is how a democracy works: You need democratic majorities, for example, to leave Hartz IV behind with the new welfare state concept."
Hach facts and arguments ... that would be something ... but nice that you also tweeted something about it
"Do we somehow agree? It cannot be that we can make billions loose for banks and have no money for investments and social issues. 100% approval: p. 17, p.21, p.28, https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anonse/SPD_Europaprogramm_2019.pdf…"
And how do you imagine that in a democracy where the aim is to find solutions through talks? We have clearly positioned ourselves on #FFF and want to protect the climate in a democratic way
Or you take a closer look at the debate and find out: There are good arguments for Nordstream 2: &quot;Anyone who questions Nord Stream 2 is dependent on American fracking gas or wants to revive nuclear power&quot; https: //www.zeit. en / politics / international / 2019-04 / gaspipeline-nord-stream-2-spd-manfred-weber…
"The rent brake is just the beginning, but an important step., Does not replace housing construction, but is still correct: http://bit.ly/2XJHdLs Minimum wage is no joke! It has to be higher, yes, that&#39;s why want 12 € in Germany"
"We need more investments, that costs money, but we need fair taxation: https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/steuergerechtigkeit/… No! The right to return full time is a really big and important thing! Especially for young parents and especially mothers (1/2)"

"Phew ... you&#39;re not here to argue, are you?"
What shoud that? Do you also have an argument or just wanted to unload a bit of anger?
"- Nordstream is 2 for energy supply - Union&#39;s zigzag course: Economy says yes to Nordstream, foreign policy says no, what&#39;s the course now? Where are you missing the debate now?"
"Yes, it is being implemented."
and over 90% say no to the AfD. Do you want to conduct political debates here or spread your pictures with numbers games?
What the government is doing there is very questionable in many areas ... We have learned from experience and say: We must finally leave Hartz IV behind.

Ne. What is this comment about?
It is obvious that Hartz IV is from yesterday and we finally need a new solution that is future-proof. Therefore our answer is: A new welfare state for the FRG with a basic pension without a means test. https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/detail/news/neuer-sozialstaat/10/02/2019/…

Hopefully your racist rubbish will get boring at some point.
Do you also have something constructive to contribute or just want to unload frustration here?
"There are similar problems across Europe, so there is more to it than finding common solutions."

The conservatives do not oppose the impending rightward shift in #Europe. We cannot rely on them to save Europe. It depends on us. The whole story in @larsklingbeil | s thread and his article in @welt - #EuropaistdieAnantwort
But our concept anyway is that there are enough waffles for everyone.
But they taste sooooooo good 🥺
We hope to be able to win you back.
One is currently stopped. We will keep the waffles for now 😉 https://www.zeit.de/politik/2019-03/bundesregierung-verlaengert-ruestungsexportstopp-fuer-saudi-arabien…
"European minimum wage, common tax policy based on majority principle and taxation of internet giants, promotion of European. Youth, investment. The? https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/…"
It would be a new minimum wage law at European level and therefore independent of D.
Helmut Schmidt was a really great chancellor and for us at least one of the top 3 chancellors in D 😉. Society and the world have changed in many ways. Yesterday&#39;s ideas are rarely the answers to tomorrow.
"🤔 € 12 minimum wage, EU foreign minister, EU parliamentary army, no privatization of public services, fair taxation of internet giants. and many more, have a look here: https://www.spd.de/europa-ist-die-antwort/unsere-ziel/…"
Are you talking about it? What do you think is bad about reducing the number of traffic fatalities? https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/verkehr/isa-automatisches-tempolimit-ab-2022/…

@buttnerbjorn @larsklingbeil @welt But it is also illusory to believe that we implement an entire election program with 20%.
"Then an increase from the minimum wage to € 12, as we ask him in the European elections, is a start."
We stop.
"Yes, that&#39;s the SPD. We are proud of it. If this is your problem, call the #BorisPalmer, who is sure to be happy to hear from you ..."
"That was a rhetorical question, wasn&#39;t it? You don&#39;t want an answer now, from us, what we&#39;re doing and why we think we&#39;re doing the right thing, mh?"
"Yes, and you no more than &quot;brainless, senseless, bullshit🤢&quot;. It&#39;s not fun for us either, so let&#39;s just leave it. Have a good time"
But do you accept that the idea is cool? 🤓
Our main theme is social justice. Have a look at our topic page: https://www.spd.de/standpunkte/
"But even in this tweet you cannot avoid defaming us several times. That is not a factual discourse. And yes, of course we didn&#39;t do everything right, that&#39;s why we renew ourselves."
"Climate policy is important because the impacts affect poor people first. In addition, we must not leave it to those who do not want to pursue socially responsible climate policy."
"Who are we defaming? Just because we don&#39;t allow ourselves to be mobbed without arguments? In addition, we do not want to abolish D, but think that in a globalizing world we need a stronger answer than the nation state."
In the past few weeks we have decided to move away from Hartz IV and have presented a concept for long-term care and retirement. And also in European politics we focus on a social Europe.
In case you are wondering what our campaign manager is doing over the weekend. #Waffles are the answer https://twitter.com/MichaelRueter/status/1121867339736109056…
"And unlike some others, you also know where they come from;)"
"no, they are delicious;)"
We ask again: arguments?
What are you writing there?
"That sounds very general now, look what we managed to do in 2019 alone: right of return part-time full-time, ban on cooperation, minimum pension &amp; training allowance, parity KV contributions, model declaratory action https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/was- changes-2019 / ..."

Are you crazy?! What nonsense are you spreading here?
Are you crazy? What nonsense are you spreading here?
Thank you for this contribution!
We never said that men are fundamentally against women.
"You comment here under a tweet from the party executive of the SPD. Unfortunately, we cannot discuss any events with you about public holidays in Lower Saxony."
We are not alone in the government and therefore cannot rule alone. Choose from the CDU and then be surprised or annoyed when Union manuscripts remain in compromises ?!
So we actually made sure that the arms embargo against Saudi Arabia continues.
Please thank the Union for this.
"We can understand that. Also how frustrating it is. After all, the SPD did not vote unanimously for a GroKo. Dissolving a government is anything but a trifle and has very far-reaching consequences."
"We understand your anger. We also voted against and clearly positioned ourselves against upload filters at our party convention. Leaving the GroKo would unfortunately no longer change the voting result, it would only destabilize the country."
"As I said, the SPD voted against upload filters in the EU Parliament. However, we are only a small part and do not have sole authority to make decisions. Thank the Union, who voted for it with 32 votes. These are more places than we have."
"What kind of nonsense are you talking about? Obviously you don&#39;t understand how parliamentary processes work. As part of a parliamentary group in Parliament, we do not have sole decision-making powers."
"have not been involved in legislative processes and political events, and still do so in large numbers. It is much more complicated than you represent. There is a clear power gap due to the disadvantage of women. (2/2)"
"In a society in which women do most of the poorly paid precarious work, most of the unpaid care work, with far worse pensions, very well. Women have only been able to vote for 100 years, before (1/2)"
"You also noticed that Airbnb is a platform and we therefore need an EU-wide solution, right?"
"This is Tiemo Wölken, who sits for us in the EU Parliament: https://twitter.com/woelken/status/1113928918690598914…"
"Hi, I am also an atheist and I feel very comfortable here."
But that&#39;s a cheeky claim. Would you have a timeline for us? We would be particularly interested in the Nazi era. How could we have invested in a good future there? Or generally outside of the government.
"No, that makes sense in patriarchal relationships."
Here for example: https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ruestungsexporte-spd-saudi-arabien-1.4388302…
"Yes, the situation in the GroKo is unfavorable and nothing that we have previously striven for. The situation is very different in the EU Parliament. ;)"
"We would like to disagree considerably! As Minister of Justice, Katarina has done great things on the way: https://www.bmjv.de/SiteGlobals/Forms/Search/Mediatheksuche_Formular.html?queryResultId=null&amp;pageNo=0&amp;topid=11477470…"
What do you mean?
Please what?
Because?
"Wow, we made you change! Even with asterisks! :O"
"There was no one who sits for the SPD in the EU Parliament and voted for Article 13. How did we not listen to the population? Take a look at Tiemo Wölken, who has always campaigned against upload filters: https://twitter.com/woelken/status/1113928918690598914…"
"With your ridiculous constellation reversal, you will not impress anyone here. Obviously you are not aware of what the word &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;National Socialism&quot; mean. Spam somewhere else."
You are poorly informed. Read the second sentence: &quot;(2) Men and women have equal rights. The state promotes the effective enforcement of equal rights for women and men and works to eliminate existing disadvantages.&quot;
"Funny what you are writing here, because who is telling you that the person you are talking to has always voted for the SPD and did not perhaps consciously decide at a later point in time to choose and join our party?"
This is still not a substantive reasoning that you provide here.
"We can understand that you are not enjoying this back and forth. But solidarity cannot matter, least of all when we see what a mess Brexit has led to in the UK."
"Um, no. ;) https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article188331023/Hartz-IV-weg-Wie-Andrea-Nahles-den-Sozialstaat-veraendern-will.html… And we are also committed to our European election program social Europe without an agenda policy."
Do you have anything to add or are you just here to discredit without foundation?
"Hi, stack! What nonsense you&#39;re spreading here. The establishment of equality, inter alia through quotas, is anchored in Article 3 of the Basic Law."
"Yes, we take it seriously. In the EU we are not in any group with the Union. There we voted against upload filters in parliament, quite differently than the Union;) Our Tiemo Wölken has always campaigned against upload filters. https://twitter.com/woelken"
"What nonsense are you spreading here? Election advertising can be seen by all parties before elections. And here, too, real SPDers will answer you."

"3 financing measures: 1. In the civic care insurance, private and statutory insurance are combined. 2. Care that is necessary due to illness is covered by health insurance. 3. Subsidy from the federal budget, no new contributions."
That is exactly what we do not want to allow. Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil plans to implement nationwide wages in nursing this year. The wage dumping of some carriers would finally come to an end.
"To achieve this, Labor Minister Hubertus Heil plans to implement nationwide wages in nursing this year. We hope that we can convince you in the end."
"It would also be funded through a shift in health insurance. Care that becomes necessary due to an illness must be paid for by the health insurance company. For example, costs for those in need of care are reduced."
Less than fair working conditions for people whose job it is to give help to those in need ?! Do less about the fact that those in need of care and their families have to worry about slipping into poverty ?! No. There can be no less. That is the least.
"For us, the welfare state of the future includes good #care. We take care of both people who need help and those who need it. In @BILDamSONNTAG @AndreaNahlesSPD presented our care concept. More: https://link.spd.de/ANpflege pic.twitter.com/pxcGF1Sz4M"

Nobody cares about us.
now it is already half past two ...
Nobody is graded.
How can we regain your trust?
We can even get GIFs here - it&#39;s crazy! pic.twitter.com/aURxteVU51
Please what?
Nobody assumed you were stupid. We would also like to discuss and above all we want to get better. We are dependent on constructive criticism.
What is your idea
. @ larsklingbeil: &quot;Let us bring our future program east to the public together. We are the party that holds Germany together. The splitters find their most determined opponent in the SPD. We say that clearly here in Erfurt &amp; at every other point. &quot;
. @ larsklingbeil: &quot;SPD and @dgb_news are side by side with the #Grundrente.&quot; Now support the signature campaign of the DGB ➡️ https://link.spd.de/Grundrente Now # JetztIstUnsereZeit

"We listened to the people, discussed the topic at the party convention and found a common position. Do you want to accuse us of that now?"
Wouldn&#39;t you rather get involved constructively and tell us what you think we should change?
We have always taken both the online debate and the street protests seriously. @woelken campaigned in D for the rejection of the upload filter. Nobody from the SPD has approved in parliament. We are not CDU
. @ ManuelaSchwesig: &quot;We need comprehensive 5G expansion. At every milk can.&quot; #JetztIstUnsereZeit
We can understand that and we are very sorry. We are currently in a major renewal process. Please keep interfering and look us over the fingers. This is the only way we can improve - with constructive criticism.
That is our aim.
"Yes, we give everything, but not out of despair, but out of conviction."
"OK then! Don&#39;t be fooled by the tricks of the agitators, a society that has overcome the patriarchy benefits everyone. Incl. Men;) #Now is our time"

. @ WTiefensee makes it clear: we want to give everyone in Thuringia a basic security. For this we also need the # basic pension. #JetztIstUnsereZeit
. @ MartinDulig: &quot;We live in times of great change. We have to give security. That is the central task of the SPD. In Saxony. In the east and in all of Germany.&quot; #JetztIstUnsereZeit

That is why we renew ourselves and present new concepts. For example overcoming Hartz IV: https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article188331023/Hartz-IV-weg-Wie-Andrea-Nahles-den-Sozialstaat-veraendern-will.html…

Who is talking nice here? We want a new EU policy that works against it.
"Yes, but then name them and don&#39;t just throw things like that around you."
"So we are happy to return the compliment;) So be careful: it is about a Europe in which the fruits of the economy reach people, or a Europe that is dictated by the markets. not that complicated, is it?"

"It is already clear to them that this is about whether the fruits of the economy are well received and the EU invests in its citizens, or whether the EU is dictated by markets. That is the real decision we are facing"
Can you say more about this? A bit unspecific
"Umm, what&#39;s the point? Do you have any arguments?"
"Tell me, is it still possible? We want a Europe in which the fruits of the economy reach people and you tweet about it? Is it still possible?"
Ahja ... thanks for the good debate
"They didn&#39;t even look at what we were suggesting, or;) It&#39;s not about &quot;more of it&quot;, it&#39;s about a social Europe in which the economy benefits people, and we tackle the big problems of the time together."

Nobody wants to get rid of the economy. It is only a question of economic success also reaching citizens and not just corporations.
But that&#39;s exactly what we want to do?
Because we want the EU&#39;s economic success to reach the citizens too?
And we want to change that!
Climate protection is one of the greatest tasks of our time and we must finally find ways and means of how we can meet this.
"It&#39;s just about who reaps the fruits of economic success. We believe that the economy is not an end in itself, but that something has to be received by the citizens."
"Phew, you make it pretty easy for yourself. So that you can sleep peacefully again, we would like to say to you: No, we certainly don&#39;t want to."
Again: 🤨 How do you make your sharepics and tiles for Twitter on Facebook? Are these printed papers and proposals?
🤨 You say things that are not correct: the comparison in the original tweet is exactly about: an EU that serves the citizens or one that serves the markets. An EU dictated by markets is not there for its citizens
"It&#39;s easy: you don&#39;t have to agree with us, but what you download here has nothing to do with debate. For haten without arguments, please look for another place"
"No, read again &quot;It is a choice of direction. On the one hand there is a #Europe of the economy. On the other hand there is our vision of a social Europe for the citizens. #Europe is the answer&quot;"
Was?
Do you prefer corporate Europe?
"Symbolic for the SPD: The fruits of the economy should reach the citizens, the EU must not be dictated by markets."
The criticism of Hartz IV is absolutely justified. That is why we are working on leaving it behind: https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article181872366/Andrea-Nahles-verkuendet-Abkehr-von-Agenda-2010.html…
"The basic pension is only part of our concepts to improve the pensions. It is a first starting point, it has to take place somewhere. Of course, not everything is done with her alone. Our positions on the subject of pensions: https://www.spd.de/standpunkte/rente0/…"
"At this point it is about creating independence from the partner, since women in particular are precariously employed, but deserve their own fair pension. We couldn&#39;t take these women with a http://B.Pr exam."
Is it still possible to misinterpret the sound here?
"Do you also have something constructive to contribute? If you are not interested in our policy, you do not need to express yourself in such a tone."
Are you crazy? What kind of tone are you talking about here ?!
"What exactly is your argument? Yes, you think the basic pension is good, but you want it to be higher? Then work with us on the new welfare state for the FRG. This is the only way we can do it. https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/detail/news/neuer-sozialstaat/10/02/2019/…"

"Hm, we just have to ask: How do you imagine the whole thing? A radical shift from the health insurance principle? Abolition of pension? Or does she just want to be able to endure that many people cannot make a living from their pensions?"
We have to ask again what the reproach is here: We make politics for people who choose us? Or do we want to be elected for our politics? That&#39;s obvious.
"Hm, but what&#39;s the way to the future? We will leave Hartz IV behind if we can organize a majority for our welfare state concept. But that doesn&#39;t help many retirees. But we also want to show respect for their life&#39;s work."
?
"The criticism of the agenda is welcome, but equating it with anti-Semitism is simply tasteless. So please be careful not to mix the topics."
"Hm, may we ask what you mean exactly? We say: No, we don&#39;t make it underneath. Anti-Semitism has no place in Germany."
May we ask what you mean? The problem is that with a #NoDealBrexit there are no contracts to act.
@dirk_pietzsch What please? Are you crazy? Or just mob a little?
