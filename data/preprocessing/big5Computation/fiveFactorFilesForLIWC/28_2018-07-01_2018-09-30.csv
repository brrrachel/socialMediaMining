But it is undoubtedly quite far ahead.

"Ok, there is a clear position. Yes to the flight taxi!"
"Should the voter ask for content, one can put him off for the future. Hence future party!"
"One should be careful with superlatives. Military dictatorships in Spain, Portugal, Greece, colonial conflicts with sometimes fatal consequences to this day through France and the UK ..."
So now nothing can stop the Union. Content has finally been overcome. https://twitter.com/HendrikWuest/status/1042852970252124161…
So generally the press within the AfD is considered even more valuable than the SPD.

If that&#39;s what you make of it ... good night!

Höcke had said that not all NPD members were anti-constitutional. Politically incredible idiotic. Objectively but unassailable and therefore not legally vulnerable. The right knockers came from him later. And then you could go against it.
That is nothing compared to Nahles.
Impeachment of the state presidency against the group leader. Lucke&#39;s hot economic program for his protégé from 2014.

I don&#39;t have the feeling that the SPD is ready for any kind of royal discipline.
But voters are interested in that. It just has to be differentiated at last. Ladig is the biggest profiteer of unbridled AfD bashing.
I do not mean that. What happens after the Thuringia election?
Yes bad. The bottom is reached when people comment on mirror commentators.
@KuehniKev threatens that the SPD can no longer simply work in the #groko! So I ask naively: What have they worked on so far?
@MartinSchulz is currently receiving thanks from two sides. From the AfD and from particularly stupid Social Democrats.
Schulz fights the AfD with verbal abuse and I read counter-suggestions like: &quot;when they go low ...&quot; There is something that works even worse than Schulz: moral arrogance! Hillary Clinton has done more harm to this attitude than insults could have done.
"By the way, moral arrogance is the only thing that is even less useful than insulting."
"Yes, I&#39;m always good. That&#39;s why everyone likes me here."
On the other hand
Fortunately not! God forbid!
"Sexism in the Left Group? Well, don&#39;t show off like that."
Nobody wants to conduct complex Nazi debates anymore.
"In 2013 Lucke used the word &quot;degenerate&quot;. Democracy had to be saved immediately. Nazi shouting everywhere ... In between there was a lot. And now explain in two sentences why Gedeon is anti-Semite. You lose this debate, although it would be important."
What? Naturally! There was never any serious doubt about that.
"And one thing is clear: Heise knows Landolf Ladig, with which Landolf Ladig can be blackmailed by Heise."

Then it&#39;s changed.
The girl was raped. It didn&#39;t have &quot;sex&quot;.
Someone is happy that he is not a Jew. But those who proudly take photos together with Palli activists are probably ticking that way.
Media: The heart attack was not the result of the attack. Prosecutor applies for death warrant for arrest. Sounds logical.
"If the death is not caused by the physical injury, then why is the arrest warrant for KV resulting in death?"
That
"Otherwise, there would be no need for an arrest warrant for bodily harm resulting in death."
Why do you think I point out extremism and link the decision of the OVG MV?
"And the raped woman was wearing a short skirt ... The victim was kicked to death. A pacemaker does not change this, nor does the Nazi brother."
The best way to get to our events. The pension system is not reformed in a tweet.
Right. That is why it is interesting how media convey facts.
And you spread my tweet with your comments. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Apparently only you.
"In this case, I am concerned with the victim, to which it is also emphasized that his brother is a Nazi. It is pitiful."
And I forget to mention the Nazi brother because Twitter is pretty limited.
Conceivable
Two Nazis enter Afghans and the latter dies. Can anyone imagine that all media would immediately emphasize that this was due to their pacemaker? There is no need to say more about this unworthy reporting today.
Have you ever seen Jewish parents who would ask for this?
"If he has no evidence, he has to resign. So it says."

Great! 10year organ donor then gives a free kidney transplant or liver on the action days in summer. Sounds consistent.
