It is fair to quickly reject rejected asylum seekers to their countries of origin so that we can help them. have a protective ground
"Anyone who criticizes this, like SPD general secretary Barley, stands for blatant injustice. #Strobl"
"Extension of detention pending deportation for asylum seekers, reduction of benefits and return center in North Africa are sensible suggestions"
"This brings us significantly closer to the goal of better control, order and limitation of immigration. If you don&#39;t have the right to stay, you have to go!"
"Strobl&#39;s move is correct: From the CSU&#39;s point of view, the Union is on the right track. Interior Ministers &amp; CDU should follow the suggestions."
Political Islam is not part of Germany! #Klartext
RT @CSU: Thanks for your question! #fragCSU https://t.co/R8WtM2U5gR
"If the Dutch can ban burqas, we can too. Courage and determination! #Burka"
RT @CSU: Our Secretary General @AndiScheuer wishes you a happy holiday! https://t.co/oOmFrxeeLx
"We need strong state power now, and this is what the people expect."
"Politicians now expect us to act. The point is that we put everything to the test, readjust &amp; improve."
RT @CSU: We mourn the deaths of #Berlin. Our thoughts are with the injured and the relatives of the victims! https://t.co/f2Y...
"Apparently at the end of the year, the @ SPD boss starts with good intentions. In the new year we can solve the issue together right away."
How often have we at @sigmargabriel experienced the political style &quot;big mouth behind&quot;. #Kindergeld
"For almost three years, the topic &quot;no # child benefit transfer to # EU abroad&quot; has been one of the core demands of the CSU against #social abuse."
"@robinalexander_ on the initiative of Minister of State Huber, it was newly installed - in addition to the cross, which has always hung in the entrance hall"
. @ robinalexander_ in the Bavarian State Representation in Berlin crosses are hung up and not as elsewhere
Anyone wishing to acquire German citizenship as a child of foreign parents should clearly show that they are committed to our values.
The German passport is not a junk item to take with you. # cdupt16
The expansion of dual citizenship was a bitter compromise that has not worked. # cdupt16
It is a good decision of the CDU party conference to want to reintroduce the option to exercise citizenship law. # cdupt16
The planned Q&amp;A unfortunately has to be canceled today. Let&#39;s catch up soon! #fragCSU
Tomorrow there will be another Q&amp;A: I look forward to your questions over there on the CSU Facebook page from 4:30 p.m. #fragCSU
The #PKWMaut comes and no German pays more than before! #Toll https://t.co/i8pJA4Dvdg
"Our Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt pushed through what all doubters, grumblers and critics did not think possible."
Justice has finally ruled Germany&#39;s streets. #Toll
"Compliant with European law, without additional burden for domestic vehicles, important additional revenue for our infrastructure. #Toll"
Promised - kept! The CSU lives up to the election promise: the #Toll is coming!
The #Burka is the uniform of Islamism and in enlightened Europe one shows one&#39;s face. #BurkaNeinDanke
A ban on full veiling must now also come in Germany. #Netherlands #Burka
"RT @morgenmagazin: Decisions by #Groko on #Rente are a good signal for the future, according to @AndiScheuer, #CSU, in #ZDFmoma https: //…"
Logical consequence: termination of the EU accession talks. # Turkey #EU
"For us, #human rights and #democracy are very valuable. # Turkey #EU"
"If # Turkey moves towards the #dictatorship, it has nothing to do with our European family. #EU"
ARD today at 10:45 p.m. @maischberger - new format with public debate. https://t.co/4cW6Iv1gdY
Good morning from the # CSU regional leadership. I immediately joined via Skype at @ Bild-Livetalk on https://t.co/Az0GMKhNd3. https://t.co/z5H4K0LOUa
This threatens the whole of Germany if the left front has something to say after # btw17. We have to prevent that! It&#39;s all about it!
Rejected asylum seekers should be able to stay in the country according to the will of the left-wing alliance. It is an invitation to abuse asylum.
"Berlin becomes a mecca for asylum abuse under # r2g. @spdde, @Die_Gruenen and @dieLinke override the law. #AsylMekka"
"Even if the @spdde moves towards the #Leftfront, it doesn&#39;t get any stronger in surveys! # r2g"
The SPD shadow chancellor candidate @MartinSchulz has spoken in favor of # r2g - he wants to take power in federal politics at all costs.
The #CSU today adopts a new policy program. Have fun with our # 360Video about #dieOrdnung https://t.co/X40bPqEgUg
RT @CSU: In a few hours the # CSUPT16 starts with a clear edge against a left turn in Germany and political Islam. https: // t ...
RT @CSU: Looking forward to the # CSUPT16. The final preparations are underway. https://t.co/84UQuGvm9C
Ms. Özoguz&#39;s behavior is shameful and absolutely unworthy for an integration officer of the federal government. #Kinderehe
"Again, SPD politician Aydan Özoguz is an exclusion officer instead of an integration officer. #Kinderehe"
Integration officer Özoguz rejects a general ban on child marriage and actively prevents integration into our values.
Young girls belong to school - not in front of the altar. The CSU makes this very clear in the key proposals for the party conference. # csupt16
We have to formulate with self-confidence what holds our society together and make our #cultural culture the yardstick of open society
