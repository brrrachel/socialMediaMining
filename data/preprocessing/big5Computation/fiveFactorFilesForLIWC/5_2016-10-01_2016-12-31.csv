Your double pass decision is aimed almost exclusively at Germans with Turkish roots. This is Roland Koch 2.0

"In my view, it is a clear political scandal"
That&#39;s the point. 90% of your decision is made only by young Germans with Turkish parents or grandparents. What a signal!
"By the way: You cannot give up Brazilian citizenship either, so the example was correct"
You do not have to. Thank you for admitting that the CDU decision is only directed against certain countries
Example Marroko: does not release anyone from citizenship. So before 2014 D also accepted dual citizenship
"Cheap, colleague. Then deliver here"
"Not correct! In both cases (same rent or current increase), the rent can be increased to exactly the same amount when the tenant changes."
"Of course not! #Rental brake sets absolute limit, which does not change even after previous increases #Factscheck"
Let&#39;s say that you want to deny Germans with Turkish parents what Germans with Brazilian parents are allowed to do?
Is that all for a decision that is a vote of no confidence against German young people and integration goes back years? #Doppelpass

Most of the scientific claims made by proponents of genetic engineering have turned out to be false. Consequence: none

Repeating a mantra is of no use. No right to collect and pass on non-dedicated personal (!) Data
. @ NadineSchoen criticizes my data economy plea and then only mentions the use of anonymized data. That&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s about!
Policy competence vis-à-vis the coalition partner is only on paper. But true: you didn&#39;t prevent it :-P

Dear colleague @Andreas_Schwab: Didn&#39;t you just agree to the General Data Protection Regulation with the principle of data minimization? So what!
Both will be ready before the groundbreaking ceremony for Südtangente could take place. detectable
Better accessibility by train relieves Reuterstraße. Better connection by cable car and powerful A59 too
Extension A565 and A59 and stop Rheinweg and Rhein-Ruhr-Express and cable car and electrification S23
Something happens. From 2018/19 widening of the existing highways. Construction of further tracks. Südtangente start of construction in 2030 (!)
Anyone who previously said that the CDU #Bonn was for southern Tangente was dubbed the &quot;baron of lies&quot; or dismissed as &quot;some only hear what they want&quot;
The affected CDU local associations are right: What the CDU #Bonn does with the &quot;Südtangente&quot; is electoral fraud http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/Es-brauch-mehr-Visionen- article3393649.html…

"2. Total move 2.5 - 5 billion (!) €, interest and price increases not even included"
"1. Spending on the division of labor € 7.5 million per year, incidentally decreasing and not counting savings (faster to Brussels)"
But let me give you a figure: expenditure on division of labor € 7.5 million per year. Total move € 2.5 - 5 billion

Twice as good taste: SPD and Bonn :-)
Excellent! A demand: Bottrop or Bonn? Because of the beautiful profile picture :-)
Mainly because the package is only an emergency reaction to the SPD proposal for a federal government package of 9 billion for schools :-)

2017 already eAutos at mid-range price with 400km range. And you think 2025/2030 is too early?
On what basis do you say that? Counter example: eBuses of the city of Bonn
Why?
Where did you learn democratic discourse?
Are you firmly convinced that a new car with an electric drive will be more expensive in 2025/2030 than with a &quot;clean&quot; fossil drive?
"But. It&#39;s also about feasibility. But if there is an alternative, no more right to continue harmful technology"
I did it in April. This is a strengthening of the argument
From Article 2 GG there follows an obligation for Aus for fossil drives and energy production. Alternatives exist that do not harm the atmosphere
April: My suggestion to make a binding end for emitting drives. Good thing that debate is gaining momentum http://www.ulrich-kelber.de/service/infobrief/artikel/index.html?id=2555…
