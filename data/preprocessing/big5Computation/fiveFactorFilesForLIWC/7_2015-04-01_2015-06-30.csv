"If, contrary to expectations, it is different, it is not the fault of the SPD!"

"Dear Union, clarification in the matter also helps you in the end if - as you say (Mr. Pofalla) - everything went according to the law!"
@Heiner_Garg üòá
"Anyone who endangers or even sacrifices in the struggle for the security of a democracy, justice and freedom ultimately loses security and freedom!"
"Because secret services do important work in counter-terrorism that must remain secret, strict parliamentary control is necessary!"
"The United States is also a democracy, and Congress would never let the government deny education and hold lists!"
"If the Union considers it a threat to the coalition that we call for clarification in the NSA / BND affair, that speaks for a guilty conscience!"
"Call for clarification of the BND / NSA affair is not anti-Americanism! Joint counter-terrorism, yes, never break the law or the constitution!"
SPD claims that the fight against international terrorism clearly contradicts the work of the secret services beyond the law!
"@Heiner_Garg suggest that Freiburg win at the end of the season in Hanover, HSV Schalke beat + draw from Stuttgart in Paderborn."
"@Heiner_Garg we can easily take it, right? üòâ"
I also like @Heiner_Garg!
wishes everyone a nice Sunday ;-)
"In the secret service affair, the SPD is not about party tactics (would also be questionable, topic not popular), but about trust in democracy!"

"When I take the Rhein-Haardt Bahn from Mannheim through Oggersheim and Maxdorf to Bad D√ºrkheim tomorrow, it wakes up childhood memories."
Thumbs also for the Friesenheim owls from Ludwigshafen that they stay in the handball Bundesliga. Friesenheim was also a family.
"Keep your fingers crossed for the Lauterern that they are promoted to the 1st division, because that&#39;s where they belong."
Worschtmarkt is not in Bad D√ºrkheim tomorrow but it is a fair.
"Trottwa and crumberry are rarely heard in the far north as the butter or the brook, but it was like that: On the red devils on the Betze ...."

@HugoMuellerVogg @thehartmael Is that so? I did not yet recognize that.
"@HugoMuellerVogg Praise from the right is almost always poisoned. For the rest, I was very critical of the effect of the turnout"
Jens B√∂hrnsen&#39;s resignation draws attention after the somewhat bitter victory for Rotgr√ºn in Bremen to the main cause of low turnout!
"I regret Jens B√∂hrnsen&#39;s resignation. He is a fine and noble social democrat, to whom not only the Bremen SPD owes a lot."

In the afternoon back to SH with appointments in Oststeinbek and Geesthacht. Happy Monday everyone ;-)
For me it starts shortly after 7 a.m. with an interview at Deutschlandfunk. Then later various talk and media appointments in Berlin.
Good morning from Berlin.Bremer election brought black eye for red-green with creepy poor turnout - that must be our main topic!
"Super tension in the relegation battle of the Bundesliga, tension until the end in the 2nd and 3rd leagues!"

"@jensspahn Missing topic: Good reasons for working with the United States. I&#39;m against anti-Americanism, what about Pofalla &amp; Co. German law applies!"
@jensspahn Less. They distract from information about BND in the committee of inquiry and political responsibility for the chancellery!
@jensspahn Interesting interpretation of what is going public in Berlin.
"Here is the right link to my blog about BND, NSA and everything that has to do with secret services. https://www.facebook.com/ralf.stegner/posts/876743482391856‚Ä¶"
"On the subject of BND, NSA and secret services: https://www.facebook.com/ralf.stegner/posts/876743482391856‚Ä¶"
In Neum√ºnster there are three candidates in the center-right spectrum for the OB election and our SPD candidate Elke Christina Roeder center-left!
"When old and new Nazis get cheeky again on May 1st, it only shows that a clear edge is necessary against everything that comes from the right!"
Nazis raid DGB May Day rally in Weimar. Only right-wing and united resistance helps against right-wing populists and right-wing extremists!
"The outgoing mayor of Neum√ºnster, Mr. Tauras has to listen to a lot at the DGB rally because of the negative attitude of the CDU to good work."
Together with SPD-OB candidate Elke Christina Roeder and Kirsten Eickhoff at the May Day rally of the DGB in Neum√ºnster.
125 years of Labor Day. Good and combative Mairede by DGB colleague Stefan K√∂rzell at the May Day rally in Neum√ºnster.
So now on to the Maidemo in Neum√ºnster!
Pofalla lied when he said that data protection was 100% complied with by BND and declared this NDA / BND affair to be over!
"At the latest after the Snowden revelations (USA does not complain of betrayal of secrecy!), The Chancellery had to act actively in a supervisory manner."
Cover-up and downplaying must come to an end! No more BND fairy tale lesson in the Bundestag committee! Cards on the table!
The list with the NSA search criteria used by the BND must be immediately handed over to the Bundestag investigation committee!
"Why is the Chancellery called Chancellery? Political responsibility lies with the Chancellor and her chancellor heads Altmeier, Pofalla, de Mazi√®re!"
"NSU Nazi murder series shows in dismaying ways that secret services fail. In Hessen, although a murder witness, a secret service agent does not have to testify!"
"If secret services develop their own lives + political supervision fails, democracy is endangered! Chancellery is responsible for supervision!"
"Unionsmann Schmidbauer criticizes intelligence at intelligence agencies. Are you crazy? Necessary for security, but essential democratic control!"
Happy May Day everyone ;-)
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today at the DGB Maidemo in Neum√ºnster. With minimum wages, pension package, etc., we have achieved a lot for good work!"

Minimum wage: displeasure in the Union after coalition summit
"The anti-minimum wage nest failed miserably. OK then! Pacta sunt servanda, would have been said by his Latin predecessor FJS!"
"Sometimes even &quot;one-armed bandits&quot; have a parliamentary arm: In SH, the gambler lobby has reliable friends in parliament üòâ"

"No changes to the minimum wage, even if the Bavarian lion roars! Promised contents! #SPD +++"

"Landesrechnungshof SH demands tuition fees. It&#39;s a good thing that the LRH is not responsible for politics, but only for invoice control."
Consistent clarification of all matters relating to the BND is absolutely necessary!
BND stands for &quot;Almost Still Democratic&quot; (controlled?) If everything that can be read and heard now applies.
"If this is true with the BND and would have no political + personnel consequences, we should never speak of a banana republic anywhere else."
What is currently coming through the BND as daylight does not work in a democratic constitutional state and must have consequences!
@tsghessen Did Pofalla not just finish the topic? There was something!
"With or without a handle: unemployment for Germany (AFD) Lucke, Adam, Gauland, Petry &amp; Co. is and remains an unsavory right-wing populist club!"

I think it&#39;s strange that so many right-wing idiots are romping around on my pages and think that they cause something but pity.
"@ArminLaschet Nonsense: We make energy transition and take care of jobs, unlike you did at Schwarzgelb."
Raising intolerance + fears of refugees leads directly to political responsibility for acts of violence. NO to anti-refugee baiting!
"If you want to fish in the right swamp, your hands get as dirty as the right-wing populists from AFD, PEGIDA &amp; CO. or the NPD Nazis."

wishes everyone a good start to the week ;-)
In the evening at the Otto Suhr Institute of the Free University of Berlin it was my turn to take my part in the lecture series on the digitization of politics and journalism.
I will later head the Domestic Policy Forum - afterwards there will be a press conference in the Willy-Brandt-Haus.
Good morning from Berlin. Today full of appointments with the executive bodies of the SPD and certainly many current topics.

"@MGrosseBroemer @petertauber you finally understood me, you made my day ;-)"
@christiansoeder @macava Nix da - secret services must be allowed to keep their work secret - but legal and strictly controlled in democracy!
"@SteinkeCDU @ARD_BaB @jensspahn US Congress would never let his government go through this. Friendship yes, CDU obedience no!"
@ARD_BaB @jensspahn Nonsense: Anyone who advocates democratic control of the secret services is not anti-American. On the contrary!

Homophobia is just goofy. Conservatives tell people how they should be l (i). We could help them as l (i) as they want!
"Interesting self-therapy: To speak courageously on all channels for three days, accompanied by anglicisms. Does it work ?!"
"@bilkayoeney That was certainly worthy of criticism, but was overcome. The United States never chose Hitler fascism - not even after the crisis!"
@EnricoTokar @ArminLaschet Who declares the need for clarification of the BND / NSA affair to &quot;party political antics&quot; of the SPD must dress warmly!
Anyone who believes in the German state of authority means American. To impress friends with submissiveness. Democracy demands education!
"No country has more understanding of tough parliamentary control than the United States. There was never fascism there, Nixon had to resign etc."
Would never give myself up to clumsy anti-Americanism. CDU submissiveness (Angela Merkel once campaigned for the Bush war in Washington) wrong!
"@christiansoeder @macava Obviously they were + lied to! Public statements by Pofalla &amp; Co. speak for themselves, US mails too!"
@ZDFWATCH @spdde @CDU Work secretly - yes! Work legally - necessary! Non-public parliamentary control is mandatory! Capisce?

"Union whistles in the forest. Markus Wehner oracles in FAS, topic is of no use to the SPD. It&#39;s not about party tactics. NSA / BND is about attitude!"
"@MGrosseBroemer Hardly. It said that German citizens and companies should not be spied on. After Snowden, Pofalla failed!"
@quovadisschland I have absolutely no interest in anti-Americanism! But I am very well for law and law and against Bush&#39;s Iraq war!
Pofalla &amp; Co. behaved submissively towards the USA (we already know from Angela Merkel in Bush&#39;s Iraq war): &quot;No spy&quot; lies in the election campaign!
Nobody endangers internal security if he insists that German secret services must abide by the law.
Now it&#39;s getting colorful: CDU parliamentary group leader Volker Kauder attacks Manuela Schwesig in the WAMS because she is consistently fighting the right.

"If there is no political control over secret services, democracy is damaged. NSU murder series, BND / NSA scandal, Heckler &amp; Koch-MAD etc. etc ....."
"Secret services have important roles in the fight against terrorism. But if you lie, trick, or act illegally, there is a danger!"
"Merkel&#39;s chancellor, Roland Pofalla, has apparently lied to the German public about the so-called &quot;no spy&quot; agreement with the United States."
"@petertauber @MGrosseBroemer BND-NSA scandal, tried G 36 MAD media spying in the BMVG, foreseeable childcare money failure at BVG also #CDU"
Either way: Political responsibility in the Ministry of Defense seems to overwhelm Frau von der Leyen # Committee of Inquiry
"If Frau von der Leyen does not notice anything when her ministerial office receives explosive information, then control has completely slipped away."
It is hardly believable that Frau von der Leyen found out nothing about the scandalous Heckler &amp; Koch + BMVG media spying attempt via MAD known to her office.
