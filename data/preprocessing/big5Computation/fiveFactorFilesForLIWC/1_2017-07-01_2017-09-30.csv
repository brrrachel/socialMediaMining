I am delighted that I was reelected with a big lead in my constituency (297)! With a majority in all municipalities! Thank you!
"In 2013, however, the postal voters were much lower. Therefore, turnout is probably higher in the result."
Today @JunckerEU made an important &amp; great speech about Europe: It must be the starting point for a committed debate!

They make good tweets. But that&#39;s nonsense. We have an incompatibility decision and we will never coalition with AfD.
Thank you. We&#39;ll see!
It&#39;s not that bad either :-)! But it&#39;s great that you are politically active! Greetings to the Jusos!

@Alex_gauland&#39;s attack on @oezoguz was disgusting and racist. We stand by our fellow citizens. AfD has unmasked itself.

You have to ask the journalist. who wrote the article. That would probably have also been written by the SPD Foreign Minister.

"@ARD_BaB @brigitteonline No, it is out of the question as far as I can see and think. Neither now nor after the election."
@BILDamSONNTAG But something like this: Digital citizens&#39; portal decided on a CDU proposal since December 2016!
I worked as Minister for the Environment and I also work in the Chancellery. Paris climate agreement must remain unchanged
Thank you!
Read my interview at taz online. Since I have justified and differentiated.
"No &quot;destroyed objects&quot;, but Molotov cocktails / stones against police officers, burning cars / barricades in residential areas"
Can happen in the heat of the moment!
Also Vice Chancellor and Chancellor Candidate (&quot;Mordbrenner&quot;)
"Molotov cocktails, burning cars / barricades could have killed people if the police / fire department had not acted"
It was really nice at your place! All the best!
There were many through the RAF; there would have been many now if the fire of the burning cars / barricades had gotten out of control.
"I expressly do not compare it to NSU murders, but there is, for example, extreme right-wing violence against accommodation and residents."
SPD boss even speaks of murderers ....
"&quot;Black Block&quot; is extreme left-wing violence against people: Molotov cocktails against the police, burning cars / barricades in the residential area"
I am reassured.
"By the way, the SPD chairman spoke of &quot;murderers&quot; - how is that to be categorized?"
I am very tolerant. But there is no difference between good and bad violence against people.
Throwing Molotov cocktails / stones at police officers and setting fire to cars / barricades in the residential area endangers life.
"@HoneckerMargot There are 3 Saarland celebrities: Der franz. Marshal Ney has Frankr. Ruined in Waterloo, Erich the GDR and Oscar the SPD! :-)"

@JoanaCotar This is probably the reason why so few people are interested in me and follow me on Twitter ...
@ARD_BaB @brigitteonline So that it is very clear: not now and not for the foreseeable future. The agreements are clear.
Police officers seriously injured by Molotov cocktails and stones. Anyone who lights cars / barricades in residential areas endangers lives
Good article. We need more apartments in total (over 4 years: 1.5 million) and we have to get work done! https://twitter.com/sz/status/883669877566971904‚Ä¶
"Throwing Molotov cocktails and stones at police officers, lighting barricades and cars in residential areas puts people&#39;s lives at risk."
Left-wing extremist terror in Hamburg was disgusting and as bad as terror from right-wing extremists and Islamists. Thanks police. Thanks Hamburg.
"That is my constituency! I know everyone, people, really now! :-) Thanks for your efforts!"

Many thanks to all police officers and security guards who protect our freedom and security at G20 in Hamburg!

#Pulse of Europe has helped pull Europe out of resignation. Now we have put a memorial to you in the CDU / CSU program!
