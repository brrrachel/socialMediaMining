@flueke i thought it is now about green exclamation marks!
does anyone here seriously believe that de maizière knew nothing about the drone&#39;s approval problems?
@TSmithRV?
"@DoroBaer @SvenLKoch how is that supposed to work? doro, have you made a public apology for the stuff?"
train delay if you need it! thank you @db_bahn
@bauerzwitschert I&#39;m just at gatzer.
@TiloJung I think that was not true. @sixtus
"@j_nb I don&#39;t see it that way. nevertheless, both must go."
@habichthorn you are so cultureless!
@fraeulein_tessa stuttgart!
@j_nb wer?
@TiloYoung yes! great guy.
"@TiloJung nee, he is actively involved. good group leader!"
"the @peersteinbrueck again in plain text on merkel &amp; nsa: http://mobil.fr-online.de/cms/meinung/gastbeitrag-von-peer-steinbrueck-wer-regiert-dieses-land-,4355678,23847616,view, asFitMl.html…"
@ Doppelgeist60 thanks for the hint :) good comment!
&quot;schily doesn&#39;t matter anymore.&quot; http://m.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/a-913564.html…
@HButzen @Bundestalker_s I thought so too.
@heiko not directly what. but there is a photo. I think there is the answer.
read current mirror. terrific interview. with gernot hassknecht!
@henningtillmann congratulations
@ oliver reporter i&#39;m generally a happy person :)
@neina_hh I have no overview of it
"@neina_hh nope, Munich SPD is there, for example."
@DoroBaer where now? are you standing in front of it
@ fgsd182 @spdbt surveillance state not start surveillance!
the sentence: &quot;a federal government that knows what people want&quot; has also taken on a whole new dimension. #nsa #bnd #prism
let&#39;s start a silly quarrel for a soli to distract from this basic rights.
@ victor5679 oh that&#39;s nervous propaganda from the height. takes place at the invitation of @ThomasOppermann. we clarify!
@victor5679 hah????
hey @mathiasrichel was the @kritikkultur so sensitive as a child?
"finally got to know the idol of my youth, @TiloJung. and forgot to give the @DennyRamone its ice cream."
@peterpiksa @spd_stefan didn&#39;t he really say?
reporting for de maziere today is rather suboptimal #eurohawk
would you be only half as interested in your basic rights as in this baby ...
"oh, kate was pregnant?"
"@RakRaksen yes, but I&#39;m not sitting in one"
@p_faltermann pete
was pofalla in line and has resigned?
@ victor5679 gähn.
"@DoroBaer no, create security. friedrich gives it up!"
@alvar_f would only be a farmer victim.
@DoroBaer prefer to see that you catch your arsonists again. public security suffers with you.
@mlle_krawall the misfortune must be fought back.
@mlle_krawall he actually won! #bewegungfetzt
@ walli5 you&#39;d better hope it never comes out :)
"@ victor5679 we can clarify directly after it is clear what the current government, which is responsible today, knew."
tomorrow&#39;s mirror seems to be exciting. merkel found out about prism from the press? curious if the statement is correct. #nsa #bnd
&quot;Freedom of communication is the civil rights question of the 21st century&quot; - @GescheJoost and @ThomasOppermann http://m.faz.net/aktuell/nsa-abhoeraffaere-totalueberüberwachung-deutschlands-stoppen-12288292.html…
@KalleNeukoelln @senSATZionell rather so head&gt; table
"@senSATZionell @KalleNeukoelln ey, only people with football taste may mob me!"
@henrikMSL wanted to send Merkel troops to Iraq.
i have real respect that merkel doesn&#39;t have to laugh out loud when he says &quot;most successful government&quot;. #bpk
"@maxschmidt Greetings to Garrett, Pia and the rest!"
Wait for @ victor5679.
@andreas_lenz I&#39;ve been campaigning for this for a long time. here is a current article: http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2013-07/prism-klingbeil…
@ victor5679 fundamental rights = dumbing down? blatant and that of them.
"Chancellor, I have a few questions about our fundamental rights: http://blogs.spdfraktion.de/netzpolitik/2013/07/18/prism-und-kein-ende/… #prism #nsa"
"@ migrate89 ha. who was yours? circulated on the net. praise, recognition and respect!"
the great thing about the internet: even @nico gets work. congratulation!
tomorrow morning - about 7.10am - I am at radio21 for prism / NSA and Merkel&#39;s &quot;clearing up&quot;
"do you actually get this cucumber of the day really handed out, dear @tazgezwitscher?"
@ AndreasOlschew2 @Bundestalker_s @saschalobo you have to ask #illner
@saschalobo explains the whole CSU to politics #illner
@habichthorn the tie from the CSU ler is nice.
@habichthorn one has a funny hairstyle. and the @saschalobo is there too.
I can roughly imagine Friedrich&#39;s &quot;plaintext&quot; in the USA: &quot;I want that too!&quot;
the chancellor justifies the wiretapping and says everything is ok. I can not believe it! #nsa #prism #new land
"@spdmuenster oh, everything relaxes here. there are funny places and internet."
