. @ mainwasser @_Tulkas_ I remember poll numbers that did not support your claim. Also: which left are you talking about?
". @ mainwasser This opposition exists. CSU, parts of the CDU and the SPD. Or do you think it takes Nazis in the Bundestag?"
. @ _ Tulkas_ @mainwasser This is where the AfD faction speaks within the security authorities. AfD has 7% in the survey &amp; they act as if it were popular will.
. @ _ Tulkas_ @mainwasser What does it mean: the &quot;imported security problems&quot; due to the &quot;resulting reactions on the part of the German population&quot;?
You don&#39;t have to go that far. ;-) But a clear emphasis on arguments instead of anti-TTIP hysteria is helpful. https://twitter.com/sixtus/status/658284559721697280…
. @ mainwasser Don&#39;t you think that you should check your priorities again?
. @ mainwasser I criticize that anonymous &quot;security authorities&quot; show understanding for violent refugees in advance &amp; you complain &quot;black-green&quot;?
The fact that @welt celebrates this &quot;security authorities&quot; filth uncritically because it fits into their anti-Merkel campaign goes a little too far.
