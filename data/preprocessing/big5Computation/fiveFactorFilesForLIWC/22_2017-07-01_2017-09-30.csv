1. Didn&#39;t hear anything at Juncker that I have to argue with fundamentally. 2. Many points of agreement. 3. Eco but too short. #SOTEU
#Juncker made 1 very good speech because he dared to do something. Has also taken positions that are uncomfortable for many. #SOTEU
Juncker on the British right: &quot;We will always regret Brexit. And you will soon regret it.&quot; #SOTEU
"#SOTEU: It would be better if there was only one presidency, says Juncker. For the merger of your office with that of Tusk."
Juncker advocates transnational lists for European elections. Only partial applause in the plenary. Wants to be top candidates again. #SOTEU
#SOTEU Announcement of a Subsidiarity Task Force to report back within 1 year.
Juncker&#39;s clear rejection of the Euro Parliament and the Eurozone budget. #SOTEU
"In the future, Junker wants majority decisions on corporate tax bases, VAT, digital taxation, financial transaction tax. #SOTEU"
"&quot;There must be a credible prospect of accession for the Western Balkans.&quot; Turkey, on the other hand, is moving away from Europe. #SOTEU"
Juncker calls for European Union social standards. #SOTEU
&quot;Those who cannot compromise are not capable of democracy and are not compatible with Europe.&quot; (Juncker)
Juncker: Why is there banking supervision but no supervision that ensures fairness on the job market? We&#39;ll do it. #SOTEU
"&quot;My personal 6th future scenario&quot;: 3 basic principles are freedom, equality and the rule of law. #SOTEU"
Juncker is now coming to the White Paper on the Future of the EU. &quot;You cannot decree this future from above. It has to be democratic.&quot; #SOTEU
"Juncker: In 2016, the EU accepted three times as many refugees as US / CAN / AUS combined. Promises legal immigration proposal. #SOTEU"
Digitization and refugee policy / migration complete Juncker&#39;s priorities. Praise Italy&#39;s role in receiving refugees. #SOTEU
2. Priority is a new industrial strategy for Europe. Juncker criticizes the auto industry. 3rd point: climate perspective. #SOTEU
Juncker addresses investment screening. Applause. The Commission has already agreed on a balanced proposal. #SOTEU

Schulz is even sharper against Trump than against Erdogan. Now the question of Putin and the SPD answer are still missing. #tvduell
"What has been left unmentioned so far: foreign policy, social policy, climate policy, education policy, agriculture, economic policy. #tvduell"
It is not possible that the candidates simply fall into the argument with #tvduell moderators. Arrogance of the journalists.
"In distinction from Erdogan&#39;s Turkey, Schulz scores. He shows 1 high level of determination; Merkel remains moderate in style. #tvduell"
Does Merkel really want the &quot;clergy of Islam&quot; to emphasize even more that terrorist attacks have nothing to do with Islam? #tvduell
Stupid that Schulz Merkel gives the opportunity to praise both sides of their # refugee policy. It centers itself like this. #tvduell
Unbelievable &amp; wrong that Martin Schulz Merkel puts the responsibility for the hostile behavior of HUN &amp; POL on refugees. #tvduell
"Merkel: &quot;In the past two years we have learned that we have to fight the causes of flight.&quot; Oh, you couldn&#39;t have known that before? #tvduell"

"#TVDuell: As a green player, I would definitely be for 1 second such duel. So that everyone can see where the future is not. But as a citizen? Just not!"
The four moderators of #tvduell were also weak. The range of topics of their questions was as one-sided as the topics of their talk shows.

Merkel acted tired as if #tvduell thought she was an imposition. Perhaps Schulz should have stayed with the allegation of democracy.
It is remarkable that Merkel only found her final word for half a minute on the subject of &quot;future&quot;. #tvduell
