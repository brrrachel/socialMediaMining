"@LaermMachtDoof And: Of course, retrofitting also begins to reduce noise immediately"
"@LaermMachtDoof That&#39;s right. But with trains, speed reduction immediately reduces the amount of goods to be transported"
@YoungSocialist No! Black and yellow decision wants more noise protection only for new routes that are planned from 2018 !!!
"Good Morning. Today, among other things, work breakfast with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, panel discussion on &quot;Green Trade&quot; and animal welfare law in the plenum"
"@ 2718Jupiter No, but if I don&#39;t have the experience of life myself, I don&#39;t blame the political opponent, do I?"

"@Netzunartig Explanation: So far, rail traffic has been allowed to make 5 decibels more noise than cars (bonus). Abolished correctly, but 1% of the problem"
"No additional cent for noise protection, zero European initiative, no help on existing routes. Only newly planned routes from 2018 #fail"
"@bridgerdier K-sole approved, but 8000 euros per wagon. LL sole approved, but only 2000 euros"
"Ludwigsburg CDU-MP also celebrates &quot;abolition of the rail noise bonus&quot;. However, this also does not apply to the rail expansion in his constituency"
From 2020 wagons that have not been converted will be banned in the EU 2/2
Sometimes it&#39;s easy. A freight car has to be inspected every eight years. So allow the quiet brake sole by 2013. 1.2
"For a billion euros, rail noise across Europe could be halved within eight years. Refitting the old wagons!"
"CDU / CSU / FDP deputies do not understand their own rail noise application. Claim that this makes the Rhine Valley quieter. Wrong, not for inventory"
Rail noise must finally be consistently reduced. The black and yellow coalition only wants 3 decibels less on new lines

Merkel does not know the debt limit: regulation is 0.35% dependent (!) On the economy. That&#39;s why the Bundesbank says the government is breaking the debt ceiling
Merkel has been talking for 20 minutes. Nothing specific about how to proceed in Europe. Nothing about domestic politics ...
