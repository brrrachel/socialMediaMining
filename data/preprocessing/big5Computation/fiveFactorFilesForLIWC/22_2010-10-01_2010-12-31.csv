@AntjeHermenau value system? I think that&#39;s #Merkel&#39;s weak side. It has a vague &quot;freedom&quot; agenda. But otherwise value pudding.
Richling: &quot;Politics in Germany is now only a man-made natural disaster.&quot;
My thesis: We are experiencing the birth of the fourth #Merkel. First Kohl&#39;s girl. Then neoliberal. Then in the middle. Now try to #conservative profile.
That conservatives criticize #Wulff because of. # Islam statements - expected. That #Merkel attaches importance to setting other accents - interesting.
@_tillwe_ Congrats!
FDP Minister #Goll calls S21 protesters &quot;wealthy&quot;. Does #FDP really no longer want to go to the state parliament in March?

"Big production in Bremen: brownies nibble away the wall + behind it is the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of German democracy."
Wulff: Germans should remain the engine of Europe. Europe is our future. Good commitment and no edge. Better than nothing. But not good.
"Wulff: His subtext means: If everyone makes an effort, it will. Does he know something that would not be a win-win solution?"
Wulff: &quot;The strength of consensus is Germany.&quot; Then where does Mappus belong?
Wulff: Islam is now also part of Germany. Calls on Goethe. No applause.
Wulff: &quot;We are a people&quot; understand today as an invitation to everyone who lives here. I&#39;m also the president of German Muslims.
"Wulff: appreciate diversity, close cracks in our society! No applause."
"Wulff: Living environments in Germany tend to drift apart, including that of the people and representatives of the people."
It is good that Wulff places the turn in the context of European freedom movements.
After all! Wulff has been talking about the turn of 1990 for 4-5 minutes and has not yet mentioned Kohl.
"Bundes-Wulff: Worship was good today. Oh, did I miss something? ;-)"
"At the unity celebration in Bremen, Bremen&#39;s Börnsen gives a small, humble welcome speech. Then they sing Hallaluja."

. @ davidblnde I have nothing to do with you stealing at me. should follow. May be anonymous higher reason. ;-) Do it anyway.
Good advice on the way to #unity celebration in HB: &quot;Be careful with any criticism of the # Wulff speech. Presidents are so sensitive.&quot;
@reuterstrasse We will go crazy afterwards when we have realized THAT. Promised! ;-)
@SkaKeller Eben! That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing it!

"In ZDF, cowardly #Mappus shifts responsibility for yesterday&#39;s escalation at # S21 to local police leadership. Otherwise, he talks about it."
Mappus loses a lot of votes with Marietta Slomka on ZDF due to his stubbornness: &quot;We don&#39;t need demonstrations.&quot;
