@caechter I personally (@Haetscher) see a higher value in something in which I invest. Take membership seriously
@ caechter You shouldn&#39;t say that general. And this is certainly not a real scientific evaluation here.
"@caechter There are always two sides. You could also ask, how do you get party to open up to interested parties?"
"@caechter There will surely be clever diploma theses soon, which we find difficult to anticipate from our internal perspective. ;)"
@caechter no problem.
"@caechter As already written: the idea is not new, it just hasn&#39;t got through organizationally. Until now."
@caechter And there are no members because they have no voting rights in contrast to full and guest members.
"@caechter The opportunity to become a supporter has only existed since July 1st, so we don&#39;t have any statistics yet."
@caechter doesn&#39;t matter. It is always a question of time before ideas become established in practice. More on this in the Frankfurt issues v 2001
@caechter It&#39;s not like the pirates reinvented the wheel. We already had the concept of the supporter party SPD in 2001.
