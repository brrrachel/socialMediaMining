The Union will ensure that little remains of the SPD election program.
"Dear SPD members, be sovereign + vote as you like! If you see it as I do, you can&#39;t really agree #GroKo"
It will be a standstill coalition. Compromising standstill is never a good thing. #GroKo

@jonas_media 256 643 of the 474 820 SPD members with voting rights voted for the coalition agreement with the Union. That is 54 percent.
The approval of 54% of the membership is not a license for future SPD ministers to support Merkel&#39;s course too obediently. #GroKo
The SPD leadership would do well to enforce as much social democracy as possible in the coalition with the Union in the real sense. #GroKo
@SonMathieu Bundestag + Bundesregierung should make applications for a ban as constitutional organs. Here is our application: http://t.co/i2XhvUpCrA
Mandela&#39;s answer to oppression was not revenge. The world admired + adored him for it. So far she has followed his example too rarely
Nelson Mandela&#39;s greatest achievement is to have led the black majority in South Africa to reconcile with the white minority
We need a dominance of democracy over the banks and not a dominance of the banks over democracy.
"The punishment hurts the banks, but not enough. They have to be scaled down + publicly designed like savings banks. #Libor"
The EU fine is an overdue signal to the criminal minds who think they are safe from control in the financial markets. #Libor
"The political + social examination of neo-fascism, racism + anti-Semitism must be conducted with even greater determination."
"But one thing must also be clear: if the ban on the NPD succeeds, the Nazis will not simply vanish into thin air."
A society has to endure many parties. But the NPD is crossing the line. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in favor of banning the NPD.
I do not want to participate in speculation about secret additional agreements to the coalition agreement. But you are not surprised.

@ Government4tel No.
The international community must lay down the ban on nuclear weapons in its charter. The UN veto powers should make significant progress.
The nuclear threat to our civilization will only be averted if all 8 nuclear powers renounce this status together.
And it deeply shakes me that there are still politicians who find justifications for killing.
It deeply shakes me that today TV and internet killing is a daily guest in our living rooms.
I don&#39;t understand why the national trauma that triggered Kennedy&#39;s assassination in the United States didn&#39;t turn away from violence.
@ t4paulchen Ja.
Union + SPD leave policyholders completely alone with the risks of premium development + the rising costs of medical progress.
The SPD also sacrifices the basic idea of citizens&#39; insurance for the coalition.

"CDU / CSU / SPD / FDP have been united in a grand coalition of arms exporters since 2005, which allows business with the dead from D. to be granted."

The risk is great that 4 years with Merkel + Seehofer will not change the social injustice + leave a traumatized SPD.
"Late, almost too late: Sigmar Gabriel is unable to explain why he previously helped Merkel with another four years as chancellor."
The SPD is ready to talk to us in 2017. I welcome the fact that the SPD is announcing a step towards political + European normality.
@ThomasOccupy (mi) Unfortunately Gregor Gysi has to make other appointments on these days. The @Leftfraktion is also there this year.
An agreement with Iran would give a historic push for efforts to find a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
Iran should take an example from the Federal Republic of Germany as a nuclear phase-out in terms of energy policy.
"Until the nuclear negotiations with Iran resume on November 20, Europe will have to find a common line that has so far been lacking."
"Unfortunately there was no association later, only an accession. New problems have arisen. There is something new to do, but nothing less."
"The opening of the border with the Federal Republic on November 9, 1989 was the beginning of the end of the GDR + the Cold War. There were many opportunities"
We can only find a new beginning in the 21st century together.
"Anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia are phenomena of the Middle Ages that also shaped the 20th century."
"The new federal government must unconditionally, reliably + adequately promote initiatives against right-wing extremism, racism, anti-Semitism"

All 64 members of the @Left faction must bring their full competence to show government errors + clear alternatives.
"Not the SPD election promise, but rather the less ambitious Chancellor Merkel will shape the policy of the federal government."

It is not enough to commemorate the Jews persecuted and murdered by the Nazis on the 75th anniversary of the Reich&#39;s program night.
The new federal government must bundle massive investments with the EU Parliament + Commission to boost the economy + social-ecological restructuring
"Europe needs a Marshall Plan, which three months ago, alongside LEFT and trade unions, also demanded from an SPD candidate for chancellor."
"For apparently robust Germany, sooner or later the markets that it is still flooding with its exports will sooner or later break away."
"Merkel&#39;s cutbacks + fixed economy damage sustained economic development, domestic demand + social peace in Europe."

@SempreLallo The federal government must provide intensive information until the special session and provide the Bundestag with comprehensive information.
