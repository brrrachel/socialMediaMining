I support the struggle of Iranian women for their right to self-determination. Nobody is allowed to determine what to wear or not. The only exception: Carnival-themed party.
But that would be civil or criminal proceedings before a court. Then who is the defendant? The network. Then it is also the duty to remove illegal content.

Simply read both sentences again in peace.
The Berlin constitutional protection report p.75ff. leads the NBS under &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot; (MB) / IGD &quot;and continues to monitor the NBS in 2017. Just sweep that under the table.
"Yes, you are right with pure symbols: https://causa.tagesspiegel.de/politik/muslimische-organisation-wie-stark-ist-der-einfluss-von-aussen/rise-als-chance-die-deutsche-islampolitik- needs-a-restart.html…"
what a nonsensical question.
"But that&#39;s conservative, progressive would be dice or let a TED decide."
Then give away your newspapers. Just because you&#39;ve always taken money to stick with it is something old fashioned.
Eben and the judgments of the @BVerfG lead to a clear conclusion: neutrality law in the bin.
"Some criticize when you ask questions in Islamist contexts, others criticize when you defend the religious practice of Muslims. For some you become an Islam critic, for others you understand Islamism. Dare more Basic Law!"
But religion is never just private. You shouldn&#39;t put the light under the bushel.
?
"But without religion is not neutral, it is without religion according to the secular worldview."
"No, &quot;visible religious or ideological symbols&quot; are cross, star of David, Shahada. There are no religious regulations to wear them: https://causa.tagesspiegel.de/politik/muslimische-organisation-wie-stark-ist-der-einfluss-von-aussen/rise-als-chance-die-deutsche-islampolitik -needs-a-restart.html…"
What privileges do you mean?
I quote you: no one thinks retweets are endorsements.
"Adhering to religious clothing regulations is first of all an exercise of faith, at most it is only made symbolic by others."
"No, the ban on symbols is presumably permissible. It is not the blanket ban on adhering to religious clothing regulations. That is judged."
Did I say Matar is an Islamist? I don&#39;t know that. There are a few statements that need explanation.
&quot;I would like to know what Mr. Matar thinks about Israel if he assumes that the Israeli military will shoot a woman on the street.&quot; Https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article171893178/Breitscheidplatz-in- Berlin-Who-is-Mohamed-Matar-at-the-commemoration-prayers.html…

We need clearer integration measures and engagement with Islamic associations and the involvement of migrant self-organizations.
But that is only for the public prosecutor and not part of religious policy
Secularism refers to a worldview that is limited to the immanence and secularization of society and does not address religious questions that go beyond this.
"Secularism is a worldview, it must not be made the official church or state religion."
"the UETD operates mosques in Austria? With us @UETD only acts as AKP Germany, Erdogan&#39;s jubilant Persian."
the story has such a beard http://www.bento.de/queer/lgbt-dieses-modelabel-entwirft-kopftuecher-in-regenbogen-farben-1827197/…
"Read the Basic Law. In Germany there is freedom of religion, equal rights for all (un) believers and there is no state religion or official church. Amen."
Where do you live?
"Since when have freedom rights been something private? Freedom of expression only in the quiet closet. This is for dictatorships, not democracies."
"so now just read again. Then you will learn to differentiate between Islamist and Islamic. I will. Just read more slowly than tweet, then understanding will work."
Politics must change from the condemnation mode to the action mode. The problem does not diminish from incantations. https://twitter.com/welt/status/946686022989041664…
The @BVerfG has sufficiently committed itself to this.
"No, freedom from religion is not strictly neutral, but a specific worldview position."
The Berlin Neutrality Act confuses exile from religion with neutrality. This fundamentalist secularism violates religious freedom and thus the Basic Law. https://twitter.com/rbbabendschau/status/942469834499117057…
No.
"Is there an American airline that doesn&#39;t transport Muslims? From Paris to Berlin, for example?"
I currently only know about Kuwait
No matter what they corrected. The calls were loud and there were threats and calls for murder against Jews. What do you want to talk down and play down?
The Air Traffic Act is clear: Air carriers have a non-discriminatory obligation to transport. Anyone who does not meet these requirements is not reliable &amp; the Federal Minister of Transport can withdraw his start and landing rights. Christian Schmidt Go for it =&gt; @KuwaitAirways https://twitter.com/volker_beck/status/946663590278418432…
To what extent does the tweet &quot;denounce&quot; whom? To what extent is anti-Semitism named and criticized betrayal or blackening?

You are spreading the claim that there were no anti-Semitic calls. What kind of mission are you doing?
"And as far as I know, that&#39;s not true. I have witnesses who gave me the calls before it was in the newspaper."
Almost there.
"If you don&#39;t even show them what&#39;s going wrong, they won&#39;t change it at all."

"Israel has learned that if it does not pay attention to its security, it is no longer there. This won&#39;t be solved with a circle of chairs."
I only fictionally switch symbols and groups from the demonstrations. And you realize how absurd that was.
Where does something from Jews appear in the course?
"where is what you write in my tweet? Exactly, nowhere."
"But why should no Jews live in Hebron, at Abraham&#39;s grave? Until the 1929 massacre, Jews always lived there. That could and should be possible under Palestinian security, right?"
"I also criticize the settlement construction. The evacuation of the settlements in Gaza, unlike Sinai, was thanked with tens of thousands of rockets."
But the financing of terror through @palestine (“martyr&#39;s pensions”) is a systematic aggression. You don&#39;t even have to talk about Hamas&#39; terror against its people and Israel.
Arresting criminals is not annihilation. Border crossings by the security forces are punished by the Israeli judiciary. And a lot is not perfect there.
Israel does not murder and distribute. Victory in a defense war legitimizes the occupation of the opposing territory up to a peace settlement of the conflicting parties.
Do you read what they write to you? Respectful discussions start with the perception of the other position.
Guantanamo really has nothing to do with Israel http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/014/1701421.pdf…
The wars of the Arab States in 1948 and 1967 aimed to wipe out Israel. Iran and Hamas etc. have repeatedly declared the destruction of Israel as their goal.
why have the Christian Palestinians almost completely and increasingly left Gaza and not Israel?
"No, the other way around: it&#39;s because of the will to destroy against Israel &amp; anti-Israeli anti-Semitism."

Mutilation is also rightly forbidden. Circumcision of the male child is permitted under the conditions of § 1631 d BGB and has nothing to do with it.

The #KRM comments on a (foreign policy) topic in connection with which there are anti-Semitic riots in Germany and is silent about the riots - this is clearly a failure.
With 40% of anti-Israeli anti-Semitism it is necessary and self-evident that the Central Council also raises its voice when it comes to double standards or Israel&#39;s existence.
"The Central Council has been on hand for years when (other) minorities are attacked. And these are not attacked by Jews. Still, he never hesitates to speak out for her."
"It is a pity that only anti-Semites are ready to criminalize the Jewish religion. Well, anti-Semites don&#39;t want to be called anti-Semites."

You could read my TL for review ....
"can you say where I came from critics of Trump&#39;s decision, generally or otherwise with suspected anti-Semitism? You can certainly prove this claim. PS: by the way, I criticized them myself."
"I&#39;m not the Israeli government either, so your Bible quote is wrong. And what do the Jews of Gothenburg and Berlin have to do with Mr. Liebermann. Exactly, nothing."
Because an article by me appeared there. Would you be able to see in the free table of contents.

"Discontinued because the main suspects are not available abroad, not because of a lack of guilt"
No.
The 1948 war was waged against this proposal by the Arab side. Then came the Egyptian march on Sinai and the Jordanian attack on Israel in 1967.
because it is staged as a trump card and is not part of an overall strategy. So you can&#39;t really act sensibly as a world power.
"Dear @aimanMazyek, what do the wars against Israel rely on, if not the right of the stronger? What was it like for Jews to access their holy sites under Jordanian occupation? How did the Jewish quarter fare then? https://twitter.com/aimanmazyek/status/938391775168942080…"
it just has nothing to do with the two-state solution itself.
it&#39;s the question of what it&#39;s all about. Each country decides on its capital and not abroad.
that is the decision of the deputies - free and not bound by orders and instructions - the love of the party and the voters cannot and does not want to guarantee the constitution.
I am not one to decide. But the highest Jewish sanctuary is unlikely to be under foreign control. You have to put yourself in the minds of the parties.
what is BIG about this coalition?
"Which votes are secret in the Bundestag? No. Only elections are secret. Many votes are by name, all public."
"Yes, and a conscience decision must take into account losing the party&#39;s support. You are free for a legislature. Reelection is never guaranteed. The backbone comes at a price."
"The annoying thing about Trump&#39;s push is that he is not embedded in any strategy for the conflict, and is purely domestic motivated. But the idea that the Western Wall &amp; Jewish Quarter should be part of a Palestinian state is at least strange."
"Anyone who speaks like this has forgotten that parties are not an end in themselves, but means for the purpose of representative democracy. First the country, then the party sounds pathetic, you can replace country with content. https://twitter.com/LennartPfahler/status/933696994220142592…"
"The status of East Jerusalem, which was occupied by Jordan until 1967, must be contractually regulated between Israel &amp; the Palestinians or Israel&#39;s neighbors. But I don&#39;t think the Western Wall &amp; the Jewish Quarter will come back under Palestinian control."
"What Trump doesn&#39;t do is wise. But Germany in fact also recognizes that Jerusalem is Israel&#39;s capital when German government officials and federal presidents receive military honors from the president, prime minister and in the Knesset."
