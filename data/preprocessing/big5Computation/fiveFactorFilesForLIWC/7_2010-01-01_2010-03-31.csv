The center-right coalition in Berlin + Kiel is fighting minimum wages and wants flat rates and less participation! # CDUFDP = Antisocial
Westerwelle fishes on the right by allegedly standing up for normal workers and rushing like low-income workers and poor people like Koch!
The TAZ headlines: &quot;The idiot of the nation: Guido Westerwelle&quot;. Not true: It is dangerous. Spelled FDP = Liberal-Market-Radical-Anti-Social!

@ DerBruesseler many have made voluntary reports. Even if no evidence is useful!
@DerBruesseler No-was just a problem for V-people in management positions not for urgently needed V-people information about security against Nazis!
@politeiahilton No - but double standards of the so-called &quot;elites&quot; is significant!
@danielas thought she has!
"RT @pottblog: RT @macava: Lindner (Gen. Sec. FDP NRW + Bund) said that the CDU and FDP in NRW don&#39;t have to be taken seriously. #fb Unfortunately, yes"
Anyone who degrades citizens to taxpayers should not be surprised: black yellow = self-interest before the common good.
"It&#39;s not about law-abiding empires, but wealthy criminals. White collar crime worse than missteps by teenagers!"
@ManuelBusch it&#39;s not that simple!
"According to the law, it still has to be done!"
There is also finder&#39;s reward and leniency policy! Some crimes can not be solved with kid gloves - see V-people deployment etc!
@DerBruesseler schwarzgelb protects rich friends and donors! Tax evasion is crime against the community. + Reward!
@danielasgedanke is more specialized in wine queens = wrong target group!
@macava Rüttgers is a fake social democrat and fights for dumping wages + transfer company instead of good work that you can live on!
Back from the neighborhood visit to the Hamburg SPD in the traditional town hall. SPD is needed more urgently than ever! # Wasp coalition--

@aristokitten Happy Birthday!
Today faction: current hour requests to CDU proposal to delete non-contributory Kita year. Tax gifts + HSH bonuses instead of money for children
RT @tsghessen: #FDP Linder donation has nothing to do with positioning. And the earth is a disc. Lobbyists coalition!
"@dieGoerelived with life, snow or happiness and success?"
@LeaMaria and the just end for the wolf: I thought something when comparing!
"Kubicki says lobbyist party FDP represents employee interests in Hamburg evening paper, then the wolf represents interests of Rotkäppchen!"
Morning greeting with slush from Bordesholm. Music tip today: &quot;In the ghetto&quot; by Elvis Presley. Happy Tuesday everyone!

@Truck__Driver that&#39;s okay- every private hour spent is good for SH!
@Truck__Driver there is more to learn about it than one would like. Motto: SH = CDU = SH.
"(2) Carstensen calls the model Duke Adolf, who was the army leader of the emperor and built castles in SH-today rather air castles in SH."
"Consul Knudsen treats MP like a monarch, who suffered so badly in 2009, welcomes marriage and &quot;finally good government again&quot; (1)"
"Coming from the New Year&#39;s reception SH in Reinbek.Style as before 1988: embarrassing speeches, level underground, PHC regrets earthquake on &quot;Tahiti&quot; - cruel!"
"Even at FORSA, surveys signal that citizens are fed up with the chaos coalition of conservatives and selfish people!"
"@conum Let&#39;s go! Old dog owner saying fits PHC and Garg: They don&#39;t do anything, they just want to play (government), but they like each other-great!"
"RT @SwenWacker: Newspaper (KN, LN, SHZ) agree: No one rules in SH, there is no courage to make decisions. They do nothing - they just want to play (government)!"
@danielahutter nice morning quote!
"Today the country&#39;s New Year&#39;s reception in Reinbek, then political talks in Luebeck and panel discussion at the Luebeck Chamber of Commerce, at the MP pinches."

First meeting of the parliamentary group in the new year today. Evening reception of the SPD in Kiel&#39;s dream factory! New year begins with a new fighting spirit!
"SPD wants people to be able to live properly from their work; the so-called worker leader Ruettgers, on the other hand, cemented starvation wages!"
"Ruettgers is a bogus social democrat: With his demand for more income for HartzIVE recipients, dumping wages are permanently supported!"
"Morning greeting from Bordesholm is white, smooth and cold - so be careful today in the real world! My music tip: Paul Simon &quot;You can call me Al&quot;."
Normal working week has started with a visit to the Northern Business Association and the press conference at the start of the year for the SPD regional association!
Monday morning brings greetings from the winter country of Schleswig-Holstein. For a sunny music tip: Ryan Adams &quot;Oh my sweet Carolina&quot;.
"@Tobias_B what nonsense: if you find snow beautiful, it says nothing more than unfortunate accidents that are possible in any weather"
Party rights are against the Chancellor and her non-line policy in the FAS. CDU / CSU / FDP can obviously do anything - except governing!
"After an exciting discussion at the Kocheler Kreis on social democratic financial policy, now from Tutzing to Muenchen on a winter train journey"
@ Edelschwarz Greetings back to the north!
Morning greetings from Kochel am See. Lecture and discuss fresh and lively about financial policy. Music tip today: Cat Stevens &quot;Can&#39;t keep it in&quot;.

Morning greeting from Bordesholm. Cold and white as permanent condition = winter - nice! Music tip today: Fleetwood Mac &quot;Go your own way&quot;. Nice day!
@nilskassube You seem to be reading different newspapers than most citizens!
"The anti-state attitude of the FDP has some trains that reveal the need for treatment. In democracy, state means = we are all!"
The &quot;intellectual-political turning point&quot; of politics à la Westerwelle must be a vision after too much enjoyment of intellectual beverages: tax gift hype
"Morning greetings from SH, where it&#39;s still cold and white. Music tip today: Rolling Stones &quot;Come on&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone!"
@CBVHKO that&#39;s true - but it&#39;s about government policy on combat troops for Afghanistan.
@AlexanderAltHL Kunduz attack = national defense? Strange understanding.
"@AlexanderAltHL we say Carstensen &amp; Kubicki did what they could, but as is well known, that is modest. # Paper tigers &amp; big mouth"

@Stecki the mind and the heart are and remain left for right the raspberry spirit must be enough or on the north beach it&#39;s probably coastal fog!
Daisy is still a bit lazy. Let it snow!
Elton John: Saturday night's alright for fighting!
"@Stecki at least: musically that&#39;s okay, but if you want to be conservative progressive, you have to have a few mental drinks too much!"
@Stecki actually no music for a conservative!
@FNagel and the contracts of Mr. Ulrich and the replacement of green party delegates in Saarland?
@bueti It was also a rather friendly birthday greeting and @bueti was always one of the reliable and predictable reasons!
"@bueti not so irritated.Bin not identified as a friend of large coalitions, social liberal was a long time ago.But HH = coal + study law SL = felt"
"@_tillwe_ Well, Jamaica is an expensive holiday address for the better off and trips to it are rarely done by bike or train! Social = different"
Still the most exciting of our rival parties and still the largest pool of agreement and common ground!
"Have personally good experiences from reliable coalitions, but also see some contemporary appearance that is not progressive"
Happy city-country-river games at the ICE table next door. Shortly before Hanover I read the Greens and what has become of them for over 30 years.
The criticism of Bishop Kaesmann is hypocritical! It&#39;s good that there are courageous church representatives. Whether that black and yellow fits or not
"@AlexanderAltHL Who believes ... In truth, the Bundesliga = Merkel has pulled the fur over the ears of the amateurs Carstensen &amp; Kubicki!"
@AlexanderAltHL do you mean in the Federal Council has agreed to the nonsense ?!
"@aristokitten i where, not even half time!"

Morning greeting from Bordesholm. Music tip today: Chi Coltrane &quot;Who ever told you&quot;. Have a nice Thursday!
@RasmusAndresen I do not know what that refers to. Some of your basics quite correspond to our previous definitions (taxes)
@RasmusAndresen what are you referring to? Which press release?
@RasmusAndresen Hymns of praise from the head of government for part of the opposition - just like in the WORLD - are rather undesirable from an SPD perspective
"@RasmusAndresen I did not criticize the Greens at all, but said that the SPD developed its own concepts without squinting at others"
"@RasmusAndresen, for example, with the proposals for the complete municipalization of the job centers - no one wants, nobody can!"
Today&#39;s music tip: Deep purple &quot;Smoke on the water&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone!
