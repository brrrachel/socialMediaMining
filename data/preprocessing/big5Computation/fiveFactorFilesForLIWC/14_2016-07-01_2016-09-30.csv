"#CSU sets a clear course: we need a #ceiling, faster returns, expansion of safe countries of origin and better integration."
"After the dramatic election result at #ltwmvp, the Berlin Republic must finally make the necessary decisions."
One cannot simply go to fate and see how a protest party benefits from the deficits of the Berlin Republic.
"When good framework data of a #Groko in MV hardly count, but mainly. via Bundespol. clear signal must arrive in Berlin."
The @CSU sets a clear course.
All parties represented in the LT have lost. Now all parties in the Bundestag and Bundesrat must swivel to politics of reason.
Threats and ultimatums - the new style of # Erdogan Turkey.
"However, freedom of demonstration does not mean importing domestic conflicts into Germany, and we will closely monitor Cologne."
One thing is clear: freedom of expression and demonstration is a valuable asset. Erdogan # Turkey should take this as an example.
Turkish domestic politics has no business on German soil.
Each individual refugee has to be heard personally by the authorities and carefully checked to prevent general suspicion.
We need a registration revision of all refugees who have come to Germany. Self-disclosure is not sufficient.
The protection of the population must be the top priority in all considerations.
"A person who has become conspicuous must be deported or, if this is not possible, immediately placed under control."
"One thing is clear: Anyone who has come to Germany, becomes conspicuous and abuses the right of hospitality, must not run around freely."
#Berlin must not sink into the leftist chaos of violence. The left parties completely fail to fight rioters + stonemasons.
# Germany against France / Italy!
"Wow, Germany is playing against France AND Italy today. # Germany-France / Italy"
"When searching for a candidate, the crucial question is whether @SPDde aims at civic orientation or tries to turn completely to the left."
"The @spdde does well that it does not play games, also no games with left flashing. # President."
Deliberate intensification during the conversation in the Press Club Regensburg https://t.co/jTbsJZDfN1
"Yesterday @MartinSchulz, today Steinmeier: The #SPD is kowtowing in front of the Bosphorus, that is a serious foreign policy mistake."
"# Armenia resolution applies! Steinmeier must respect the parliamentary resolution 100%, anything else would be gross disregard for the Bundestag."
At the latest now @MartinSchulz must be clear: abort the accession negotiations and rejection of the visa-free regime. Now.
@MartinSchulz Erdogan is still waiting while purges are in progress in Turkey. Success of the visit to the Turkish court equal to 0.
The evaluation of @MartinSchulz&#39;s #Turkey excursion can only be: Anyone who goes there gives a fatal signal.
It is shameful that the #SPD wants to prohibit that we claim loyalty to our country from Turks with a German passport.
For us it is clear that those who have a German passport must also be loyal to our country. #Integration
Minister of State @oezoguz is out of place as a member of the government in the Chancellery.
"It is a declaration of bankruptcy that the # SPD politician @oezoguz, the integration officer in the Chancellery, is currently the subject of an objection."
The Chancellor is absolutely right when she demands loyalty to Germany from Turkish people in our country. #Integration
"For us it is clear: First comes the integration, then the passport."
"Completely besides, @Die_Gruenen demands to give every child born in Germany a German passport, regardless of whether parents live in Germany for 1 day or 10 years."
The German passport is not a junk item that you take with you as a second pass.
Only immigrants who have integrated well and are clearly committed to our values can obtain German citizenship.
"The #double pass is becoming more and more the norm, we don&#39;t want that, so we have to go back to the old citizenship law."
Dual citizenship can only be an absolute exception if the parents are of different nationalities.
"You can&#39;t have loyalty to two states, if you don&#39;t get it, you&#39;re a blue-eyed multiculturalist. I expect insight &amp; reason from @spdde!"
It cannot be that #Erdogan wakes up and Turks with German passports wave the red #Turkey flags in Germany.
Dual citizenship should be abolished. We have to go back to the tried and tested old citizenship law.
"Turkish domestic politics has lost nothing on German soil. If you want to get involved, go back @Straubing https://t.co/gTWfkd0PUd"
#Visa freedom for # Turkey is completely excluded in the current situation.
We are not in the Turkish bazaar to meet the 72 criteria for # visa freedom.
# Turkey requires the EU to implement # visa freedom for its citizens by October. Completely unacceptable!

"For @CSU, victim protection against perpetrator protection applies. We thank the police for their efforts to prevent further bloodshed. #Wuerzburg"
The Afghan ax attack is terrible and deeply condemned. @RenateKuenast takes the side of the perpetrator. It is perverted.
"In this situation, visa-free travel to Turkey is completely out of the question and accession negotiations must be stopped. #TuerkeiPutsch"
The generals&#39; attempted coup is just as unacceptable as Erdogan&#39;s announcement of purges. #TuerkeiPutsch
Turkey must not now slide from the coup into oppression. #TuerkeiPutsch
"It is precisely this know-it-all mentality à la Schulz that annoys citizens. With such a SPD European politician, the #EU will not get any better. #Brexit"
How the British put together a government does not concern the European Parliament President Schulz at all! #Brexit #BorisJohnson
. @ MartinSchulz embodies the &quot;EU from above&quot;. Just shut up when it comes to a purely national decision! #Brexit
#CSU media night from 6.30 p.m. Participants tweet #Roboterjournalism under #Media Night. #media #lasttweet
"Are you a bot? Then retweet us. If you are human, then follow our #Media Night to #Robot Journalism #Media Night"
State must show strength + must not be fooled around. Therefore: full solidarity with the Berlin #Polizei.
Inviting arsonists and car flarers to discussions is a political declaration of bankruptcy.
