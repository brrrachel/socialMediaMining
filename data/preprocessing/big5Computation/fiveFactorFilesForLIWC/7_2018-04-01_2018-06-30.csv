"Today various appointments in the federal capital. Discussion of the situation with the SPD state group from Schleswig-Holstein. In addition, the reception for the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival in the state representation."
"The political situation in Germany also remains unpleasant, because disputes between the Union parties continue to prevent sensible government work, regardless of the more moderate language. The CSU is whistling for national and European stability and is on the right course."
"&quot;Without words&quot; - this is the headline of major newspapers after the disgraceful elimination of the German team in the preliminary round of the World Cup in Russia. With this achievement, progress was not possible and was also not earned."

"Incidentally, I find points 13, 27 and 51 in Seehofer&#39;s ‚Äúdisaster plan‚Äù (or something similar) super, points 6, 41 and 65 debatable and points 11, 33 and 67 completely wrong. Remember yourself, what? S #Seehoferschmarrn #CSUQuark"
"The fact that seasoned Union politicians publicly declare 99.5% agreement with a so-called ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù from Mr. Seehofer, which, according to him, only the Chancellor knows, is an unprecedented testimony of poverty and a donkey among coalition partners. üëé"
Anyone who reads Horst Seehofer&#39;s interview in the &quot;Passauer Neue Presse&quot; must get the impression that the CSU leader did not take part in the coalition negotiations and did not read the coalition agreement signed by him or suffered from political amnesia.
"Miraculous change from Saul to Paul: Before the SH election, &quot;deportation TV&quot; and pork were mandatory for German canteens, today CDU Prime Minister G√ºnther on Deutschlandfunk CSU warns to avoid right-wing populist escapades before the Bavarian election. He is right üòâ"
Egomanian destruction course of the Bavarian regional party continues unabated. We have seen a party that flew out of the Bundestag with a consistently selfish profile. It is worse this time because of the national and European collateral damage.
"Today a very decent article (including the same comment) with a lurid and completely misleading heading on the front page of the regional newspaper. Always wonder why something like this has to be, especially since it discredits serious politics."

I don&#39;t know what is formal about the SPD&#39;s commitment to the coalition agreement in terms of common European politics. It is a passionate plea for European values against nationalism and right-wing populism and with clear goals for practical politics. https://twitter.com/fbanaszak/status/1008589286520819712‚Ä¶
"To accuse Malu Dreyer of all things like that is downright absurd.

Pacta sunt servanda! https://mobile.twitter.com/fbanaszak/status/1008436869699391488‚Ä¶"
The likelihood that Seehofer&#39;s so-called ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù (which still nobody knows !!!) contains further harassment beyond + outside the measures agreed in the coalition agreement is extremely high. Especially since we know enough of the CSU&#39;s blind rage with the AFD.
"In this respect, it will certainly be an exciting week - on the green lawn and elsewhere üòé"
It is also unclear what separate Union meetings in Berlin and Munich produce today. SPD leadership also advises in the afternoon. Does the CSU put the ax on European cooperation and the coalition agreement? Regional party with an exclusively tactical calculation or federal party?
It was an uneasy weekend. Unusual and well-deserved defeat of the German team against Mexico at the World Cup in Russia. They will have to increase enormously if they want to progress.
Reports that the ultimatum within the Union parties was allegedly extended by 14 days. Absurd idea that a policy of ultimatums and threats could produce acceptable results.
"Not correct. The coalition agreement clearly describes the European questions and answers. The SPD signed it after the approval of our members and Merkel, Seehofer, S√∂der and Dobrindt too! Pacta sunt servanda! https://mobile.twitter.com/aniesmann/status/1008106469236137986‚Ä¶"
"The fact that the way Donald Trump does politics, i.e. a mixture of egomania, irrationality, half-strength and unconditional will to power, is copied by German regional party princes in miniature without any moderation is terrifying."
Sunday newspapers are full of cabal between Union parties and some language pictures are more reminiscent of wars between hostile family clans. The stupid thing is that in this European and global political situation instability in the largest European country is irresponsible!

"Coalition agreement with agreement on European politics is 4 months old and bears the signatures of Alexander Dobrindt, Horst Seehofer and Markus S√∂der. The CSU provides Merkel with a public ultimatum. Donald Trump has tweeted G7 agreement from Canada on the return flight. ü§î"
Bavarian regional party takes pleasure in Trump&#39;s political style. S√∂der and Dobrindt treat Merkel like Trump Justin Trudeau. CSU and CDU fight bitterly - Lindner agrees with CSU and FDP wants Jamaica again. Habeck names CSU putschists and Greens want Jamaica again. ü§î
"In Berlin, the hardest clashes between the Union parties with high destruction potential of the Bavarian regional party. With the signature of S√∂der, Dobrindt and Seehofer, the coalition agreement stipulates everything there is to say about European politics."
"Passionate debate in the state parliament yesterday about the North German deportation prison planned by the Black Traffic Coalition in Gl√ºckstadt.

Disgusting political instrumentalization of a terrible act of violence by right-wing populists + some media reports without any consideration for the suffering of the family + friends of the victim. Nothing undoes the cruel deed and nothing justifies its political disempowerment.
The TSV Bordesholm has its second leg promotion at TuS Hartenholm. Fingers crossed!!!

In the afternoon back to the Kiel Landeshaus for the meeting of the entire parliamentary group. Prepare for the next plenary session.
Yesterday was the first day of our group board meeting here in Hohwacht. Good teamwork in the previous opposition task in the state parliament. Strategy discussion on political planning for the further legislative period.
"Today we&#39;re going back north. Closed meeting of the SPD faction board in Hohwacht. It is about the opposition work in the state parliament, which started well after the lost state parliament election, but of course can and should be continuously improved."
"The events in the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees make it clear that Angela Merkel&#39;s &quot;We can do it&quot; not only followed the humanitarian refugee policy supported by the SPD, but unfortunately also chaos and mismanagement among Union ministers of the interior and in the chancellery."
"Yesterday, after a discussion with the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Michael M√ºller, we agreed at the strategy discussion of the SPD Linken to take up his proposal of a &quot;solidary basic income&quot; and to develop a modern welfare state concept."

Special Olympics in Kiel are great advertising for the sport. The pro-Erdogan action by √ñzil and G√ºndogan is the opposite of that.
"√ñzil + G√ºndogan&#39;s propaganda campaign for campaigning Turkish rulers Erdogan are not a recommendation for the World Cup nomination. Privately, their political attitudes may be irrelevant, as a national player, the role model function would have suggested World Cup advertising with Frank Steinmeier."
"A worrying development in the Gaza Strip. Again violence, deaths and injuries and escalation of tensions instead of negotiations on security, economic prospects for all and peace. No pithy statements by the US President help either."
In the afternoon we visit the Red Vienna Museum and meet the regional chairman of the SP√ñ Michael Ludwig. Exciting day ahead.

Today the state executive of the SPD meets. The program includes an analysis of local elections and the consistent implementation of the party reforms that have been decided. Federal and state political framework conditions must be improved again - this demands the entire SPD.
"Difficult federal and state trend for our dedicated volunteer candidates in the local elections. After electoral defeats and GroKo debate, the wind came from the front. Overall disappointing result with regional light and shadow. Maintained lead in Kiel + L√ºbeck."

"Sometimes complicated things just have to be explained. So: As promised by the SPD, there will definitely be more public investments by the federal government in the next few years that are also urgently needed.

"Good public relations is important: As promised by the SPD, investments in education, infrastructure, affordable housing, digitization and childcare are increasing. Some things still lump sum in the budget of the finance minister or by tax redistribution to countries, constitutional changes necessary!"

Alan Posener raves in the WORLD on Sunday for US President Donald Trump and recommends his national selfishness to imitate. Wonderful - are the cold warriors setting the tone again? Have we learned nothing from European and especially German history?

Today it goes to the employee reception of the Steinburger SPD and to the anniversary of the local association in Schenefeld.

"Instead of exemplifying the freedom of religion of the Basic Law, the constitutional minister and CSU chief Seehofer split with unnecessary debates on Islam. And the new Bavarian Prime Minister S√∂der? He has nothing better in mind than to propagate campaign-motivated crusade of the CSU"
"In addition, we have initiated an internal party reform process in the state and federal SPD, in which, after extensive discussion, it should ultimately be decided whether and how we want to change internal democratic procedures and adapt the statutes."
"We do not know a presidential system here, but our delegates, who are democratically elected by local associations and district associations, elect board members as collegiate management bodies every two years at party conferences at district, state and federal level. That has proven itself."
"Newspaper reading with curiosities. Member participation in the North SPD is exemplary. Member vote for top candidate as mobilizing pre-election campaign 2011, determined also in 2021. Two member decisions on coalition question 2013 + 2018. Party convention elects 11 board members."
"Stephan Weil is right that we need a constructive relationship and ongoing dialogue with Russia. No uncritical Putin admiration √† la Left Party, and certainly no worship of authoritarian regimes √† la AFD. Communication + d√©tente policy remains German interest."
Tonight after the plenary session to the SPD district association in Flensburg. Discussion with the district board and the local associations before the local elections in the city.
"In addition, the black traffic light coalition makes it clear that with good work, employees and unions, apart from occasionally gracious words, it has as little in mind as with relieving families from the horrendous fees for early childhood education."
"Yesterday in the state parliament it became clear that the black traffic light coalition failed in wind energy planning, misled voters, and left the important industry and its employees in the rain."
Second plenary day today in the Kiel State House. This time it&#39;s about the sale of HSH Nordbank. Difficult chapter for business and politics in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein.

At HSH Nordbank there is pure opportunism and chaos in the government coalition. FDP makes big cheeks and insults the green finance minister. Aid from Brussels has been initiated with all the current consequences following decisions by the black and yellow coalition.
"Today plenary session of the state parliament in the Kiel State House. We are debating wind energy planning, there is literally dead trousers in the black traffic light coalition. Full-bodied election promises from G√ºnther &amp; Co. were broken, wind industry and citizens rocked."

Verbal attacks by CSU colleague Dobrindt once again show that he is one of those who have to count their fingers after shaking hands. Pacta sunt servanda. This also applies to a coalition agreement for family reunification of 1000 refugees per month + cases of hardship.

That is just the attitude of Mr. Spahn and the CSU. They also invite Mr. Orb√°n to their party conventions for edification. https://twitter.com/abaerbock/status/981836299706478592‚Ä¶
Very correct and worth reading! It is exactly like that! It&#39;s about good work and not a social transfer that means ‚Äúmanna‚Äù or ‚Äúunconditional basic income‚Äù. Most people do not want to be cared for and fed off but to be involved and well paid! https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1930743706938110&amp;id=100000074976655&amp;_rdr‚Ä¶

"Easter is a reason for interior ministers and the FDP to criticize churches because (in a few cases) they grant church asylum. That is a hard-hearted attitude for which there is no reasonable reason. Moreover, in my experience, the churches are very responsible with it."

On Easter Sunday yesterday snow and today the most beautiful sunny spring morning in the north.

&quot;Purges&quot; are part of dictatorships. Neoliberals have their own parties. Social democracy has basic values AND diversity of opinion. https://twitter.com/pgkroeger/status/980401967783702528‚Ä¶
What is self-laceration when you critically examine positions that are contrary to the basic convictions of social democracy? https://twitter.com/pgkroeger/status/980397596513636354‚Ä¶
"We have a wide range of opinions among the 460,000 members, a lively discussion culture, but also basic social democratic values and beliefs such as freedom, justice, solidarity, peace, good work, tolerance and diversity. https://twitter.com/xileffff/status/980392180828295168‚Ä¶"
Wolfgang Clement likes to call himself a &quot;social democrat without a party book&quot;. His rather neoliberal suada against the SPD and our ideas of good work in today&#39;s WELT AM SONNTAG shows that the former is not true and the latter is a good thing.
Where should that lead when the April Fools&#39; Day is becoming more and more realistic üòÇ https://twitter.com/derfreitag/status/980384547337658374‚Ä¶
"But that&#39;s a steep thesis. If you look at the performance of the black light in SH on the topics of good work or family relief in early childhood education or attitude to community schools, this will be a very daring assertion. Sentence 3 is correct. https://twitter.com/derbruesseler/status/980384529654386688‚Ä¶"

"In some debates, I am already wondering who is using all the ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù basis for themselves and their own interests. In all the necessary disputes, this is quite presumptuous (see, for example, the SPD membership vote!) And always applies to those who make politics full-time."
"It is said that hope dies last, but only a medium-sized miracle can help HSV."
A full house for the Easter weekend and that&#39;s a good thing.
The attitude of the xenophobic Lega Nord government towards the refugee boats is cruel and inhumane. No strategy justifies the cynicism of the fact that families with children drown miserably in the Mediterranean! We have to change that! https://twitter.com/am_klint/status/1011172559591788544‚Ä¶
"We are talking about the EU&#39;s external borders - not a return to turnpikes and national pre-Schengen border security.

"Today, the executive committee and party executive of the SPD meet to discuss the situation. Given the anti-European escalation of the refugee policy debate, there is much to talk about. In addition, various media events and discussions. In the evening a meeting of the state and district presidents."
"Nothing moves in the bitter dispute between the Union parties, while Europe around us, especially after Erdogan&#39;s election victory in Turkey, actually requires a stable and capable German government. Only the SPD is currently ensuring this."

Many made fun of my &quot;motivation tweet&quot; yesterday when I speculated about his substitution after Kroos&#39;s mistake at 0-1. üòÇ How many fans was pleased with my mistake that he of all people made the spectacular last minute goal. It&#39;s soccer ü§óü§óü§ó
