Thank you very much! CL
Yes;) TL
Thank you! TL
Thank you! TL
Thank you! TL
Nervous - how about reading the full interview tomorrow instead of reacting to excerpts? CL
Thank you! TL
Why are you spreading fake news? There has never been such a meeting that paper has nothing to do with the FDP. CL
Thank you! TL
"Thank you! But is not a launch, but has been established for a long time. See Facebook;) TL"
Sure - openness to technology. We focus more on ecological and social problems of e-mobility than others. CL
What do you mean by that? I drive an electric car myself! CL
The @rponline reporting is fictitious in every respect. CL

Thank you very much! CL
"Gladly, but it is not yet so far;) Choose to vote! TL"
What about the world&#39;s best education and digitization old FDP? TL
"Good sign, do you think? ;) TL"
It&#39;s not the most important thing at first. We take it with startup spirit! ;) TL

There it is: the new #Bundestag fraction. CL # btw17 @fdpbt pic.twitter.com/fx5f2rmTRm
Let&#39;s hope so. The voter decides! TL
"Thank you, we are very happy! TL"
Just keep an eye on us;) TL
It&#39;s a shame that you see it that way. The opposite is the case: nothing is as important to us as education and career opportunities! TL
Thank you! TL

Very nice and greetings to your employees! TL

What a crap. When was the last time you listened to a speech by CL? TL
"Both important. Second vote chooses party, first vote is on site for the candidate. TL"
And how was it? ;) TL
Thank you! TL
Because Germany needs an update. TL
"Thank you! But don&#39;t just keep your fingers crossed, also go vote, please;) TL"
We are all the more pleased about that. We have learned our lesson. TL
"Cool, thanks! TL"
"Thank you, dear Mr. Pinkwart! TL"
Top! Good color;) TL
Why shouldn&#39;t it be real? TL
That&#39;s what we are doing! TL
Percentage point more or less for union? No difference! But a percentage point in the battle for 3rd place #AfD vs. #FDP: changes everything! CL # BTW17
Thanks for the second vote. We would have to talk about the first voice again;) TL
Thanks! TL
Thank you! TL
Thank you! TL
Thank you! TL

Have you slept in the state parliament for the past two years? ;-) We have made requests ... CL
I was asked and explain our program. What is there to calculate? CL
Another aspect for you: We have been saying this for two years. Every speech. Election program. Parliament requests. But only noticed with BILD. CL
The AfD is a folk-collectivist and thus anti-liberal force that does not even create a clear separation from hatred of the Jews. CL
Read reference to Quran? Different from legal residence in the 90s? Some only read what they want to read. ;-) CL
There are fundamental differences in posture and position. Bad downplaying the AfD if you lump it together. CL
"If you refer to international law, government policies of the 1990s and Canada, are you right in Germany? Joke cookies! :-) CL"
ðŸ˜‚ But you have a simple worldview. CL

Exactly. Like the French president. ðŸ˜‚ CL
You have to ask the editors;) TL
Oh well. The French president has no idea. Now understood. ;-) CL
Why doesn&#39;t anyone stand alongside Macron in #TVDuell who wants to close the Mediterranean Sea and arrange entry via Africa? CL

Why does nobody explain in #TVDuell that integration is first the expectation of a liberal society and not its achievement. CL

Then we basically have no dissent. CL
Aha? The SPD always wanted flexibility in the process when it came to sanctions. Why are you denying that now? Election campaign what? ;-) CL

Nobody wants. Bugbear. See BILD tomorrow. CL
"I have less against the Greens than you against us. Ecology? Yes! Ways? Dissent. Unfortunately, you cannot discuss this. Your Beer. CL"
Without context: I work with the principle of interpretive goodwill. It&#39;s the opposite of: Turn the word in your mouth. ;-) CL
The truth? CL

Crimea? The FDP participated in the iron curtain falling. There you protested in Bonn meadows against the NATO double decision. CL
"If the interview refutes the election program, I hereby solemnly declare: the election program applies, not my interviews! :-) CL"
Have we got involved? Or have you? Or do you just need a clumsy enemy image because you are bored? Hmmm. ðŸ¤” CL
Perhaps (!) According to the North Cyprus model that you have never criticized to my knowledge - just hopefully not for so long. CL
Aha. Please give details of where we release the individual from liability at the expense of the collective. Take care of correction immediately! CL
"Who relativizes violations of international law? But some conflicts have to be frozen. At Springer, Kissinger goes in and out ... CL"
The passage in the election program for Russia refutes your thesis of the proximity of the FDP to Linker and AfD. CL
"Exactly ... ðŸ˜‚ If you think of us like this, you must immediately leave the governments in SH and RLP. Or confess your cynicism. CL"
There is no &quot;willingness to adapt&quot;. You can only come to the absurd assumption because you haven&#39;t dealt with us for years. CL
Which party wants the ban on state bank bailouts and compensation for diesel buyers at the expense of corporations rather than the state? CL
Who speaks of acceptance? It&#39;s about freezing a conflict to make movement possible elsewhere. It is an old recipe. CL
"But that is not liberalism, because freedom never releases from responsibility, liability or rules. That is his exciting punch line. CL"
"A wrong assumption. Germany is part of the West for the FDP, equidistance applies to the AfD and the Left. CL"
Quite simply: I remember my interesting interview. And that at that time with @berndulrich was naturally mentally exciting. CL
"You are no longer in the film, Bernd. In your texts, too, you are still working on Westerwelle. Come into the present! CL"
We&#39;re pleased. Do you just come to speak? TL
"So: # Loosen sanctions on progress, tighten on regression. Do not accept annexation # Crimea, but talk about other questions. CL pic.twitter.com/pmdHaCgmDU"
I am disappointed that BILD is commenting on this level after years in which the FDP is positioned as transatlantic as never before. ðŸ™ˆ CL
"No, nobody spoke of acceptance. But as with the CSCE process, some conflicts have to be frozen temporarily. CL"
Of course this is a violation of international law. Only some conflicts have to be temporarily frozen in order to achieve movement elsewhere. CL
Absolutely true: in the electoral program you read exactly the mechanism of tightening sanctions or gradually loosening them. CL
