1.45 p.m .: Gregor Gysi and Katja Kipping on the coalition agreement between Union and SPD immediately in the livestream: http://www.linksfraktion.de/livestream/
@microweblog We also don&#39;t like it. Our youth association has distanced itself from it. http://www.linksjugend-solid.de/2013/10/24/erklaerung-des-bundessprecher_innen-rates-vom-24-10-2013/…
@PeterRNeumann Oh. And then why monitoring Merkel and all other phone calls?
@PeterRNeumann But around ...?
"This is how Merkel becomes a terrorist: &quot;Without the information from the United States, there would have been terrorist attacks in Germany,&quot; said a # VS man to the world &quot;"
From about 18.10 livestream: Our series &quot;PRINTED&quot; - reading and discussion with Gregor Gysi and Gesine Lötzsch: http://www.die-linke.de/mediathek/livestream/…
@Mic_Ruby Only a small part because there is a limit (€ 1650). Companies cannot sell party donations.
"@ KingBronco69 No, our online editorial team will do it with Club Mate and #WoW."
"@jonathan_storz @neuwalker @Firstbescheid We see it that way too. However: only two boycotted, not everyone else."
@Sofareporter @GregorGysi Wrong. We do not voluntarily accept corporate donations.
@boell_stiftung @apabiz surprise ...
Incredible protection of the constitution: @PetraPauMaHe refuse to inspect files. &quot;Too much work&quot;. Dissolve the dirt shop. http://bit.ly/16UPdhv
@HomerJayJustin Thanks for the link. The question from them is a bit stupid. One can immediately ask &quot;Do you want a headache?&quot;
@julia_witt Greetings back. We are not jealous at all.
@HomerJayJustin Is that so? Then we will do more educational work and information.
@BenjaminHoff @berlinliebich @forum_ds We assume that.
@ theotherone73 @ Kalashnikitty22 @Piratenmaps Not only because of this - a year ago the surveys saw us at 5-6%. The rest is worked out.
@meckesgirl The comrades of our AG Christians also see it that way. Why not?
@_uta_ We submit the applications as soon as the Bundestag meets again. The SPD and Greens then only have to agree.
@ trading sheet nine. We don&#39;t do things by halves.
@Synelly We are for the removal of the blocking clauses. We think they are undemocratic because they endanger equal opportunities.
"@GrueneRostock @Piratenpartei @spdde @Die_Gruenen At your own general meeting, only 65.7% or what? tsstsstss"
