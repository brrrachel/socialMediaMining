"Good conversation with my predecessors as SPD state leader Günther Jansen, Gerd Walter and Claus Möller and ex-MP Björn Engholm."
Unfortunately Björn Höcke can hardly be &quot;deported&quot; because no democratic state would accept him. Shame for Germany.
Why do we ignore neo-Nazi baiting from Höcke &amp; Co. Not? Do we go AFD on the glue? No! Democrats must never tolerate brown spirit!
The idea that history teacher Höcke poisoned school brains with his Nazi propaganda is hardly less creepy than AFD political agitation.
Provocation - turmoil - semi-denial pseudo-distancing - this is how the right-wing man works even with Mr Höcke&#39;s disgusting agitation.
Not the Holocaust memorial in Berlin but Nazi propaganda by the AFD agitator Björn Höcke are a shame for Germany. #NieWiederRechts
