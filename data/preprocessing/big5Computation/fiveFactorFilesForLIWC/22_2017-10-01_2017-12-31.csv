May I read this replica in such a way that you already admit that Israeli politics does create problems for a negotiated peace? Then why shouldn&#39;t you criticize them?
You deliberately ignore the annexation? And your speech about the &quot;recognition of reality&quot; challenges questions: Who decides who has to recognize which reality? What about the &quot;reality&quot; of Jewish settlements in the West Bank? &quot;Recognize&quot;?
The question is demagogic. 1. What Israel does and whether other states formally recognize it are two different things. 2. How many states are there that extend their capital to annexed territory? 3. Do we want negotiation peace or not?
Did the President of the Central Council actually have any advice on how Europe should act to further expand settlement construction in the West Bank? https://twitter.com/tagesspiegel/status/944542705362833408…

Arsenij #Roginskij and his friends from Memorial have repeatedly convinced me of the European calling and future #Russia.

Arsenij #Roginskij has done a lot for Russian-Polish and Russian-German understanding. He kept the memory of the crimes of Stalinism alive and encouraged many young people to take a critical look at history.
"Now the funeral of Arsenij #Roginskij, the great and humble historian, political intellectual and human rights activist of #Memorial, is taking place in Moscow at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery. RIP"

"Don&#39;t you want to or can&#39;t understand that? The point is that the &quot;homeland&quot; term, contrary to @sebibrux, does not belong to the right."
Have already sensed elsewhere that we in the European Parliament will request a debate on the events for next week.
I cannot discuss home term in 140 characters. But they are enough to show that &quot;homeland&quot; does not belong to the right. That&#39;s why Bloch. https://twitter.com/MXPichl/status/914556493617385473…
@PatrickGensing&#39;s claim that one should understand &quot;home as a unique and immutable identity and origin&quot; is arbitrary.
"Do you have any further information on how the urban eye clearers see this? Polls, according to which only rural pomerania are susceptible to &quot;home&quot; or something?"

We Greens will bring up the events next week in the European Parliament.
"No, because Ströbele criticizes the Spanish government, which deserves this criticism, and does not take its mistakes as an occasion to base the EU."
Rushing is not a legitimate criticism. And don&#39;t lie either.
