@MLP_officiel Bravo! FN has an EU referendum in its program.
"@StriegSe (# Greens) convicted as a liar! I should have called for labor camps in the plenum, Striegel should listen and read the minutes!"

"Party speech Martin Schulz (SPD): little program, a lot of self-adulation and again National Socialism ... from the day before yesterday!"
Quade (#Linke) and Striegel (#Green) return the # AfD application &quot;Overcoming the Asylum Crisis&quot; with #National Socialism - pure left populism!
"# AfD demand for education: performance principle, without sweat no price; Lippmann (#Linke) railed against it in plenary. Typical left laziness?"
District meeting in #Naumburg in the #Burgenlandkreis - the connection to the municipality is important.
None of this but the clear statement that you have nothing to do with the left depraved and anti-German sentiment! https://twitter.com/oldnobody2015/status/825360023706546178…
"In the plenary session, Höppner (#Linke) said on horseback: animals cannot be used for this. 3000 years has humanity done everything wrong?"

Schulenburg (CDU) urges AfD to be more relaxed in the CDU style. Didn&#39;t that just let the CDU creep to the left?
Prime Minister Haseloff should follow his Saarland colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU) by banning Turkish election campaigns in LSA!
"Kolb-Janssen (SPD) again calls for a mandatory 50% quota of women in committees, what is this nonsense? Qualification instead of gender!"
"Current tensions between European countries and Turkey are of course not due to &quot;dual citizenship&quot; etc., right?"
"According to Pahl (#SPD) and Lüddemann (# Greens), the #AfD is to blame for the violent attack at the University of Magdeburg because its presence provokes."

Heirs (SPD) with criticism of state deputy Mittelstädt (AfD) failed in the Council of Elders. #SPD # Green #links have raised enough themselves.
"So, council of elders. SPD complains about the statement of the AfD &quot;Club Mafia&quot; in the plenum as worthy of order. Let&#39;s see what comes out."
"De Maizière: ankle restraints for endangered people, cell phone evaluation to determine origin - correct #AfD works!"
