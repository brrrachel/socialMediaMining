"In any case, I have not voted AGAINST your request!"
The physical weight ratios are right! :-)
Challenge &amp; deal accepted! I look forward to good cooperation! üéâüëç https://twitter.com/kuehnikev/status/1202203695179534341‚Ä¶
Honor to whom honor is due! Congratulation! https://twitter.com/GeorgMaringer/status/1201896483286667264‚Ä¶
"Congratulations, dear Jens, you and your colleagues!"
The result of the vote in the SPD was clear. Congratulations to @NowaboFM and @EskenSaskia. Respect for @OlafScholz and @klara_geywitz.
"Good news for Lusatia: With the implementation of the climate protection package, 150 new jobs will be created that we want to locate in Wei√üwasser / Saxony. Congratulations Lausitz, thank you Mdb&#39;s Thomas Jurk and Andreas Mattfeldt!"
"I always choose my words carefully: in both cases it was not a question of systems, but of the integrity of the data of German citizens. Large sections of the public were convinced of &quot;mass surveillance&quot; of US telecommunications. Which was wrong, by the way."
But you still know that I strongly defended the United States against such criticism back then ...
This is an absolute distortion of the facts: I then and now defended the United States as a democracy out of conviction against some left and Green voters.
Here we agree! https://twitter.com/Oliver_Krischer/status/1198198467832758272‚Ä¶
"We take these concerns very seriously. That is why we are leaving coal-fired power generation, why we are increasing the share of renewable energies, and why we are spending over 40,000,000,000 Epro on climate protection. https://twitter.com/deLinhuberin/status/1196713693381349376‚Ä¶"
Mr. @Oliver_Krischer obviously does not know his way around: There are surcharges for locations with less wind and discounts for locations with stronger winds. That is why the feed-in tariffs are very different! The industry knows all of this.
"On the contrary: by taking the concerns of millions of citizens seriously, we create the conditions for more wind farms to be approved and built again. It is disappointing that green Baden-W√ºrttemberg is realizing as few projects as other countries!"
"Indeed, it has been clear to every politician for decades that neither politicians from the opposition nor their own government are criticized from abroad ... https://twitter.com/drumheadberlin/status/1188066048421126144 ..."
"It is even genuinely ingenious: The Holy Grail was also often searched for, every time it was believed to have been found, but then it never met expectations, so the search continued undaunted ... https://twitter.com/erik_fluegge/status / 1188117872964440065‚Ä¶"
"Why are you arguing so wrongly?: During my tenure, more tenders for wind turbines were made than before. The expansion has collapsed because there are hardly any approved locations in the countries. My suggestions to change that are welcomed by the wind industry."
"Thomas De Maizi√®re has served our country and its liberal constitution for many decades. The blockade of his lecture in G√∂ttingen by the anti-fascist left is an outrageous disregard for right and person, which we cannot accept! https://twitter.com/HNA_online/status/1186391876053676033‚Ä¶"
"I too was elected to the Bundestag 25 years ago, together with others, for the first time! We were new, inexperienced and had no house power. But we were determined to fight and make a difference: for Europe and for Germany! https://twitter.com/ArminLaschet/status/1184411680647925760‚Ä¶"
"#Halle: Anti-Semitic agitation and terror have a new quality and scope. Together with Jewish organizations, we have to create protection and security, show respect and recognition. Without Jewish citizens, Germany would be different &amp; worse. You are part of us!"
"We take up your request to approve fewer wind turbines in the vicinity of residential buildings. In return, we want to speed up approval procedures at other locations. This is the only way the energy transition can succeed in a human-friendly manner."
"That&#39;s the way it is! A great reason for joy, recognition and confidence! https://twitter.com/BMWi_Bund/status/1194531204252475392‚Ä¶"
But that would be pretty much the first time that a sermon has been followed en masse! üòé (Of course I only mean sermons outside the pulpit!) Https://twitter.com/jwschoop/status/1180838555637211138‚Ä¶
"Unfortunately, this is fundamentally wrong: As early as 2012, when the expansion was at its highest (7,500 MW), the solar industry went to its knees because almost all people in Germany had the cheap Chinese panels made on the roof. By the way, they are made in China with German machines!"
"Congratulations, Mr. Enzensberger! You were one of the post-war bright spots of my school days, you gave a lot to our country, which you can still agree with today, but which you can also rub yourself against! Thank you very much and all the best! https://twitter.com/FAZ_Feuilleton/status/1193807705728864256‚Ä¶"
"We have been there for a long time: At the wind summit in my ministry, agreement was reached on necessary changes: the implementation plan is in place, now the federal states and federal ministries have to do their homework! https://twitter.com/HerethDominic/status/1192937645439143946‚Ä¶"
The 0.2% reduction in unemployment insurance contributions decided by the coalition committee is an important factor for more economic growth and jobs! This is a key requirement of the BMWi!
@MarcoBuschmann is more than right here: we have known for more than 40 years that socialism has never worked anywhere: it has made the rich poorer but not the poor. :-( https://twitter.com/MarcoBuschmann/status/1191433985496354816‚Ä¶
Postponing the coalition committee meeting is a good and correct decision: progress can only be made with solid and sustainable funding and clarity in the means test
Thank you! It&#39;s OK now!
Thank you! https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1189146993295269889‚Ä¶
"Thank you very much for the many good wishes! After the shock of my fall, I am treated very well by specialist staff at the Dortmund Clinic. Apart from bruises and lacerations, apparently nothing serious. Thanks to all! Peter Altmaier"
So! https://twitter.com/maxmueller6/status/1189038694650568709 ...
It was clear from the start that the coal exit law would be introduced in the Bundestag before the end of November. It stays that way.
"Your analysis of the real causes of poor election results is brilliant! The traditional parties have to reinvent themselves, otherwise they will not turn the tide! https://twitter.com/matthiasfuchs_/status/1188735345388654592‚Ä¶"
"Dear @MikeMohring, I keep my fingers crossed for you and your Thuringia for today! With a stable and responsible government with you at the top, Thuringia will have a bright future!"
