Various appointments together with our SPD Mayor candidate for Neumünster Elke Christina Roeder.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Only today in the Kiel office. Then I visited my constituency with my colleague Kirsten Eickhoff in Neumünster.

3rd regional conference of the SPD LANDTAGSFRATION &quot;Promised-Keeping&quot; in Bad Schwartau with Minister of Education Britta Ernst + good discussion.
"@ Bonds2trade @dgb_news @heuteshow said the actor, who also became US President thanks to &quot;Big Money&quot;."

On to the 2nd regional conference of the SPD parliamentary group &quot;Versürechen-Gehalten&quot;
"A personal commentary on the day&#39;s events, role models, mistakes and remorse. https://www.facebook.com/ralf.stegner/posts/845619605504244…"
"@SturmDaniel well (former) senators and deputies are already among the leaders who serve as role models, right?"
Calls to quit are what is now possible. Arbitration proceedings are carried out independently and according to formal criteria and rules.
"Social-democratic leaders must act as role models, which is why continuing party membership by Sarrazin or Edathy is harmful."
"No word for the victims, no insight or remorse + maximum political damage for our basic values-SPD wants to have nothing to do with it!"
"No insight or remorse, no wrongful awareness and maximum damage"
"Who justifies violence against children, which is not at all compatible with our basic values, has not understood anything and should leave SPD!"
Still very fit at 90 and a great club: that&#39;s the Friedrich Ebert Foundation!
"Congratulations from the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung + Chairman Kurt Beck on their 90th birthday! If they didn&#39;t exist, they would have to be invented!"
@dgb_news @heuteshow Strikes the current debate about the alleged bureaucracy in the minimum wage law better than some other post!
wishes everyone a good start to the week ;-)
Later back to SH. 2nd regional conference &quot;Promised-Keeping&quot; of the SPD parliamentary group in Bad Oldesloe. This time with Interior Minister Studt.
"Good morning from Berlin. Committee meetings at the Willy-Brandt Haus, as well as press talks and other appointments."

@ Doppelgeist60 She simply has the better arguments on her side. It&#39;s as simple as that. #Jauch
Black and yellow propaganda sayings have just been shown again: &quot;The minimum wage is GDR without a wall and costs 100 thousand jobs&quot; #Yes
@ Doppelgeist60 Tichy&#39;s macho comment disqualifies itself ;-)
So sans “@ Doppelgeist60: Bit strange that Ilse Aigner takes on the role of the opposition. The #CSU is still in the government. #Jauch &quot;
"@andreaspetzold well, do you seriously mean that government overrides working tariff autonomy ?!"
Anyone who campaigns for fair minimum wages for workers is attacked. This also shows the round at &quot;Jauch&quot;. Abuse is denied.
@_drsarkozy Cool. 18-20 just don&#39;t fit! Congratulations 😉
@GerdKotoll @Guggulu @RolandTichy Why is it not surprising that you can&#39;t do anything with this term ?!
"@Guggulu @GerdKotoll @RolandTichy No idea of democracy, there are some in your circles."
@MatthiasBannas something like this might be talkable if the effects of the law are reviewed after a reasonable amount of time.
"We have nothing against foreigners, but .... We are not against the minimum wage, but .... nobody understands us, but ..... Well, what noticed?"
"We are not against the minimum wage - i where - NO, we just do not want its compliance to be checked. Oh sooo. Ask?!"
"On this rainy Sunday, a lot of anti-minimum wage trolls were apparently online. In the long run it would be a bit too boring for me."
"Anti-minimum wage law troop is really excited if you reject the nonsense here. Quite lousy, this freedom of argument."
"Find with satisfaction that the whole deal against the minimum wage law will be without consequences, so feel free to work on me😉"
@ victor5679 @RolandTichy The anti-minimum wage roar + crying about working time documentation 2013 should be intellectual discourse? Armes D.
@dasstimmvieh @RolandTichy @spdde so if you take such nonsense you are &quot;the sovereign&quot; - imagination is also an education.
@JurgenPresser @RolandTichy Dream on ;-)
What should you fear from this nonsense ?! “@RolandTichy:. @ Ralf_Stegner ... and here are the texts that the SPD fears http://www.rolandtichy.de/meinungen/politikerinnen-ohne-betriebspraktikum/…”

"Incidentally, the Tichy polemicized against Nahles and Fahimi and loaded with clichés, but he doesn&#39;t get the minimum wage!"
"The Union type, which polemicized against Greek politicians in the Bundestag as a &quot;used car dealer&quot;, itself looked like a cone player!"

@KaiDiekmann I am very committed to arguing about the EU&#39;s Greece course; but then with an honest analysis of causes and effects
"Europe is not just an economic and monetary union, but a community of values that stands for social democracy, peace and freedom!"
@KaiDiekmann @spdde @FAZ_Wirtschaft this is really exactly the opposite of what I said or think is right!
"@KaiDiekmann You know, I am not part of the politicians&#39; club of pasters, but I also say my opinion when not everyone likes it"
@KaiDiekmann Barschel &amp; Co.?! I expressly share that! I am always for the truth! Just not everything that is said to be true!
"@KaiDiekmann @spdde that referred to your Prodi quote. Under certain conditions this may be the truth, one can doubt it!"

"In democracy, people vote out this kind of reforms - if you force them from outside, not democracy wins, but right-wingers!"

"@KaiDiekmann @RenateKuenast @BILD @FAZ_NET doesn&#39;t change the fact that a campaign against the Greek people may arrive, but is wrong!"
@KaiDiekmann @RenateKuenast @BILD @FAZ_NET
@KaiDiekmann @RenateKuenast @BILD The truth is such a thing - everything always depends on requirements. Growth instead of austerity!
@KaiDiekmann @RenateKuenast @BILD How about growth policy for Europe instead of &quot;reforms&quot; that only affect the &quot;little ones&quot; ?!
@FDPWoerrstadt @Metaliberal strange that my criticism of abuse is answered as if they are not a few black sheep!
"What kind of self-pitying reactions you get when you get a little virtual with conservatives, neoliberals &amp; consorts😉"
@RolandTichy Read the characterization of Andrea Nahles + Yasmin Fahimi in your article - you don&#39;t have to be so self-envious!
"When it comes to normal (lower class) crime, people call for toughness! With white collars, tax crime, etc. it is very different!"
"Incidentally, undeclared work has always been punishable - just like that!"
"People who have violated long-standing working hours law now fly up when the minimum wage is checked, that&#39;s a problem!"

Document working hours - how can you tackle this huge challenge in 2015 ?! Papua New Guinea? No Germany!
The whole disaster started when the socialists introduced the same right to vote. Employers have been harassed since 1919.
Employers know what is good for their workers. Why does the state interfere at all ?!
The fact that these workers also want money for their work should be happy to have a job. Controls? Socialism!
What there is ...... 😉 “@martinhabersaat: V for Varoufakis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afl9WFGJE0M…”

@ Doppelgeist60 where you can’t read anything today 😉
Fighting articles in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung against Hannelore Kraft and NRW SPD. Social Democratic line displeases conservatives!
It is simply terrible socialism if there is suddenly a lower wage limit that is also controlled by the state!
Mr. Tichy is in the WAMS against Andrea Nahles and Yasmin Fahimi- but above all against terrible bureaucracy? Where? Bingo: minimum wage!

"CDU opposition in SH completely from the role: Opposition leader with solos sometimes for, sometimes against and crime statistics in Fantasialand."
More Greens in country responsibility than Union governments and then Seehofer blocks energy transition and Union makes big cheeks.
"Union you might have to say that contracts apply to adults, that without a SPD it has no majority + is shrinking in size in countries."
"Want to eliminate solos and cold progression at the same time, against minimum wages, equality + rent brake - is union still possible?"
Absurd theater about planned wage dumping in Dithmarschen. Whenever regulations are in force - tariff loyalty law with minimum wage applies!

Good mood at the 1st regional conference of the SPD parliamentary group &quot;Promised-Keeping&quot; with Torsten Albig in Neumünster today.
Ms. Siems (WELT) calls minimum wages &quot;social policies that drive spending&quot;. When taxpayers increase dumping wages it means market economy!
That’s part of it! “@ Doppelgeist60: Now Gabriel is getting something from #TTIP and is promoting the continuation of the détente policy with #Russia.”
"The goal is prosperity for everyone, not wealth for the few. Political primacy must also have priority at TTIP and CETA! (Sigmar Gabriel)"
"If V-Mann knew beforehand what happened at the later crime scene, did nothing + remained silent, there is at least initial suspicion of aid."
Why is the public prosecutor&#39;s office not taking action after new publications on the involvement of the Hessian man in NSU murder.
Good start every week ;-)

@DrKissler @ArminLaschet Hardly.
@ArminLaschet @CDUNRW_Fraktion Rotgrün in NRW did not vote against the committee of inquiry!
@RasmusAndresen @SGFleHa Have fun doing it 😊
@ArminLaschet is a security officer suspected in NRW of having been involved in the murder? That is the case in Hessen.
It is bad enough that the black-green Hessian coalition shows zero interest in clarification in the NSU murder series. Victims don&#39;t deserve this!
"The Hessian NSU investigation committee, which was enforced against the will of Schwarzgrün, has plenty of educational work to do. What did Bouffier know?"
Such miserable crap! HSV has to accept compensation shortly before the end.

Practical problems with sports clubs etc. can and will be solved safely; the general attack on minimum wages only shows its correctness!
Those who have apparently disregarded the Working Hours Act for years are now caught because the working hours are documented with the minimum wage.
The permanent attacks against the supposedly excessive bureaucracy in the Minimum Wage Act show how important it was to enforce it!

Social democratic TTIP would create primacy of democratic politics for a free and fair organization of trade relations. (GS)
(2) Gesine Schwan and Gustav Horn wrote this in a worthwhile guest post about TTIP for the Frankfurter Rundschau today.
"TTIP must not abolish politically desired regulation for freedom, justice, solidarity in favor of private particular interests. (1)"
"Of course, no reasons for whining and nagging against alleged bureaucracy, which is rather aimed at minimum wages themselves. (3)"
There are no reasons for the general shouting and nagging of the employers against the minimum wage and its review! (2)
Certainly you have to check documentation requirements for the minimum wage after a reasonable time and clarify real problems (sports clubs etc.). (1)
One has to be surprised: the so-called &quot;Association of Taxpayers&quot; awards right-wing populist anti-euro and migration policy (in) sense.

"If Anke Spoorendonk made findings from investigative proceedings public, she would be punishable, but opposition wants that."
An oppressive understanding of the rule of law by Kubicki &amp; Günther: They complain of Minister Spoorendonk&#39;s disregard for the law and ask them to break the law.
The truth in the press release by the CDU opposition leader Günther on the JVA Lübeck can only be found in trace elements with a magnifying glass.

"@MGrosseBroemer By the way, you should explain this to your Thuringian party friend Mohring!"
@MGrosseBroemer I have criticized this clearly! No commonality with right-wing populists - neither in Greece nor in Germany!
"What to do? Prohibit violence of all provenance, live tolerance and diversity! Promote freedom of expression - stand up against those who stir up fears!"
What to do? Strengthen the common good! It is not the case that there are no alternatives in politics. &quot;Without alternative&quot; = non-word of this time.
What to do? Promote peace and détente policies instead of breaking military taboos! Fighting causes of flight instead of weapons export records!
"What to do? Finally understand that Germany, the exporting country, is only doing well in the long run if its southern neighbors also have prospects!"
What to do? Investing in education and the future instead of breeding ground for populists and right-wing extremists! Solidarity instead of arrogance!
What to do? Strengthen democracy instead of tolerating the primacy of the economy! Develop Europe as a community of values not only as a monetary union!
What to do: Ruin taxes for the super rich instead of communities! Corporations that pay taxes where profits are made! Dry out tax havens!
What to do: European growth instead of austerity policy! Investments instead of youth unemployment! Reforms that don&#39;t subjugate the population!

"One knows the behavior of captains who give sailing instructions from land. With pirates, core competence is less on land anyway ;-)"
The JVA debate showed that if proof was needed that opposition people should not be given government responsibility.

Somehow you get the impression that some are hyperventilating politically. Sober perspectives recognize Nazi nonsense without too much effort.
Sensational revelation: Hitler was a Nazi.Bachmann in a public Hitler pose is PEGIDA &amp; CO too much - before &quot;only&quot; Nazi sayings.

With the coastal coalition there will be no cuts in university budgets in SH! Promised - kept! That remains our principle!
What a hypocrisy when the CDU &amp; FDP in SH are now arguing against university cuts. We had to clear up educational policy shards!
@_drsarkozy Cool!

On the subject of stupidity and intellectual rubbish: https://www.facebook.com/ralf.stegner/posts/819901824742689…
Scheibner&#39;s quote about stupidity helps a bit to endure intellectual rubbish that is deposited on the right on Twitter and Facebook.
"Looking at right-wing populist demos and their leaders, Hans Scheibner said: &quot;How well you live with stupidity that you don&#39;t know about&quot;."
wishes everyone a nice weekend ;-)
"Encouraging expressions of solidarity everywhere against violence and for freedom, tolerance and diversity. Mourning with the relatives of the victims."

"Solving real problems, but there can be no understanding of what used to be called &quot;healthy people&#39;s feeling&quot;, only resolute resistance."
Talking about the Islamization of Saxony or Germany is only possible in the case of pronounced perceptual disorders - professional help is necessary!
"On the other hand, the clear majority of those who take to the streets for tolerance is encouraging. Adhering to PEGIDA (better IDIOTIGA) is wrong!"
I am surprised that some here believe they can successfully intervene in the Greek election campaign. That is arrogant and foolish.
Good morning from Bordesholm. First meetings and talks today in the Kiel State House. I wish everyone a nice day ;-)
Macy Gray - I Try (With lyric) This is my music tip for you today ;-) http://youtu.be/D-ixrjQRZIw

@Patrick_Kunkel @SWagenknecht jubilee tweets? Do you speak German?
I hear! #TatortKiel
@EnricoTokar and? Are contracts canceled? Is Hungary excluded from the EU due to abolition of press freedom? Dialogue instead of scaremongering!
What is at stake is the right of the Greeks to choose their own government in free democratic elections. The EU must respect that.
Also criticized right-wing populism in the Swiss referendum &quot;against mass immigration to Switzerland&quot;.
@ Doppelgeist60 It doesn&#39;t have to be me. 140 characters are scarce - my attitude is differentiated. But: All 10 tweets apply 😉
"But it is always clear to all of us that the SPD never commits itself to the agitation of foreigners and intolerance, racism and enemies of freedom!"
"As a politician, I conduct discussions with critical or concerned citizens constantly and everywhere - in citizen consultation hours and in public!"
In this discussion forum of neutral organizers or TV debates you have to expose AFD and other armed players from the right!
"Yasmin Fahimi aptly describes how obnoxious right-wing propaganda is, you can see, hear, smell it! http://mobil.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/spd-generalsekretaerin-yasmin-fahimi-zu-pegida-hass-und-hetze-nahm-zu,23785274,29651636.html…"
"With propaganda a la xenophobia, racism, intolerance or &quot;lying press&quot; there is no dialogue but only a clear rejection!"
No hysteria through security laws that remove our freedom what terrorists want. Clear commitment to tolerance and diversity!
"The SPD must never blink on the right like others. We always have to show that THE politics don&#39;t exist, that we can + solve problems."
"That means hard engagement with PEGIDA, AFD &amp; consortium, also in TV discussions, no pandering a la CSU: attitude instead of division!"
"The leaders of PEGIDA &amp; CO are something else: For right-wing populists and xenophobes, for neo-Nazis and frighteners, only distinction is possible!"
"Avoid any topic here: I always said that politicians take real concerns seriously, and that they have to face dialogue more with citizens!"
Take real concerns of people seriously and talk to you about them - politicians always have to face right-wing populists and xenophobes!
Press topics: Nagger choir against minimum wage meets with clear SPD rejection! Later you will evaluate implementing regulations - that&#39;s it!
Concerns about Kiel University Hospital due to multi-resistant germs. Unexplained deaths: Ex-Minister of Health Garg immediately scandalized on air.

Rod Stewart Live in Argentina 1989-Every beat of my heart This is my music tip for you today ;-) http://youtu.be/6gQScGP4Ff8
The first step is to prevent attempts to circumvent and abuse the Minimum Wage Act. SPD enforced minimum wages!
Andrea Nahles has presented a good law - this will be evaluated in implementing regulations after a reasonable time - that must be enough!
Rum oils about minimum wage law is getting annoying. 3 weeks after the entry into force there is nothing to correct! No change with the SPD!
Opposition press releases on the Fehmarnbelt link and nuclear waste debate show the desolate state of this fundamental opposition
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Start of the state conference today with debates on terrorist attack, justice and many other topics."

Uni Lübeck black and yellow has flattened university Today they play as saviors when coal is demanded that Haun hits the government
"Actually, one has to prescribe CDU &amp; FDP a term of penance not to say anything about statements about Uni Lübeck - like Ms. Schavan in the Vatican."
"&quot;What do I care about my chatter from yesterday&quot;, that is the philosophy of CDU &amp; FDP when it comes to the University of Lübeck."
"Inflagranti to be caught by hand in the cash register and &quot;keep calling the thief&quot;, that is the role of CDU &amp; FDP in the matter of Uni Lübeck."
The fact that the CDU &amp; FDP are brave enough to criticize our university policy after trying to flatten the University of Lübeck is brazen!
Moving transparency: &quot;Grandparents: guest workers. Parents: Turks. Me: German-Turkish. My child: Muslims. When will we finally be Germans?&quot;
"Heiko Maas is right if he not only shows a clear edge when it comes to PEGIDA &amp; CO, but also points out the legal situation when storing data."
That people of the Union suspect Ms. Merkel that Salafists + extremists will also speak if she appreciates Islam speaks volumes!

"Freedom, tolerance, cosmopolitanism, non-violence are the foundation of our democratic social order, which we must never reveal!"
"Terrorist violence is shameful without exception, never justifiable! Instrumentalization for xenophobic propaganda unacceptable!"
Disgusting attempts to politically abuse cruel assassinations in France for intolerance + racism have already begun in networks.
I wonder how long the IDIOTIGA (best abbreviation) hype will last. Because there are many more people who are committed to refugees!
Germany is colorful: everywhere in the country impressive demonstrations for solidarity with refugees and against right-wing populists + hollow heads!

"Ms. Merkel can ensure order in Union in 2015: Clear demarcation of AFD &amp; PEGIDA, not only in New Year&#39;s speeches but in practical politics!"
"The SPD has long been demanding that young refugees can finish their training here, and we can implement it quickly, CSU! We save the rest!"
"Classic division of tasks: Merkel is friendly about refugees, her Union is meanwhile pursuing a more consistent deportation policy!"
"In this respect, the Union should rather help the AFDists &amp; Co. To stand up to it, instead of leaving it to the SPD and pandering to the right!"
"PEGIDA AND AFD stand for resentment against refugees, against Europe, against tolerance and solidarity. You don&#39;t mess with that!"
Immediately afterwards demands from the Union for a rightward turn in asylum policy. It is clear that there is no such thing with the SPD in the coalition!
Today again the PEGIDA pimping at CSU Minister Müller. Unctuous words on dealing with refugees in Seehofer&#39;s New Year&#39;s speech.
