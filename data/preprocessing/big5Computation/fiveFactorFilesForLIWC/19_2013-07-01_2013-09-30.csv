"If Schäuble announces another Greece bailout package a month before the election, that should be only half the truth"
In our democracy there must be no governments + security apparatuses that take people into custody to intimidate critics
The anti-terror laws have also become an open threat to our democracy.
We cannot accept that in Europe a person can be bullied at 9 a.m. because his partner reported Snowden revelations.
Federal governments of the SPD / Greens (2002-05) + Union / SPD (2005-06) approved exports of 102 t of components of the nerve gas sarin to Syria.

"September 22: Sleep in, have breakfast, vote. @dielinke Photo: Jakob Huber http://t.co/Q7jrDQCrsy"
But Springer&#39;s commitment shows how nervous Merkel&#39;s backers in the boardroom are. And maybe they have a reason for that.
Parties and the media should let citizens vote undisturbed on election Sunday. In other countries this is regulated by law for a good reason.
The fact that @BILD prints a poll on election Sunday is an attempt to influence the risk of confusing the poll with the result
"I am curious when the BND will declare that it has not given advice that the chemicals in Syria are toothpaste, not poison gas"
"And as a modern form of slavery, temporary agency work should either be banned or regulated in France (110% of wages)."
An hourly wage of 8.50 euros is far below the low wage threshold and is not even enough for a pension equal to the basic security.
"East German agency workers are disadvantaged compared to West Germans in the 23rd year of unity, with the same cost structure."
Temporary workers are further disadvantaged compared to their permanent colleagues in the company in which they work.
The EU must aggressively call for Obama to have international control over all chemical weapons in #Syria + an arms embargo for the region.
(mi) #Gysi asks: How does #Merkel want to have checked whether the chemicals came into toothpaste or into deadly nerve gas? http://t.co/T98O1Owid9

I urge the current federal government to immediately stop all arms and arms exports.
"Germany is apparently complicit in the death of over 1400 children, women and men from the chemical weapons attack on August 21. in Damascus"

@ theskunk89 A ceasefire in the civil war must be reached through negotiations + so that the suffering of the civilian population can be stopped.
Merkel must now leave her role as a foreign policy spectator and take a position. #Syria
Everything must be done to ensure that those involved walk through the door to a diplomatic solution that Russia has opened #Syria
@wfmokadd Ja.
The Bundestag must immediately decide to withdraw the Bundeswehr including the Partiot rockets from Turkey immediately. #Syria

@JanJosefLiefers Nobody knows how Russia would behave in such a situation.
@JanJosefLiefers An invasion would lead to counter reactions from other countries + caused a conflagration including Lebanon + Jordan.
@JanJosefLiefers A short military strike does not kill and end the disaster.

"The most important thing is that all nuclear, biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction must be banned and destroyed."
Those responsible for this massacre must be convicted and brought before the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The government in Damascus must allow the UN weapons inspectors to work freely and to cooperate fully with them.
The background of the alleged poison gas attack in Irbin must be clarified on site by UN experts.
The U.S. Army is preparing to intervene in Syria. What would happen if Russia intervened? Such disasters must be avoided.
Not a single US war effort in the Middle East has made life there safer + least of all political stability.

"In 2007, the CDU / CSU + SPD abolished state electricity price supervision. Electricity prices rose by almost 40 percent. This is how the market regulates."
But Westerwelle is right in this regard: only one dialogue would have helped the Egyptians under Mursi. And that applies even more today
The federal government could have tried to prevent the tragedy in Egypt by not accepting the military coup.

How unbearable must the reality be for Seehofer that he gives parents in Bavaria pre-filled applications for childcare allowance?

I am not surprised that the people of the SPD and Steinbrück no longer trust the junior partnership in a coalition under Merkel
Steinbrück + I on the same page in the ARD # Germany trend: It makes me think that Merkel&#39;s challenger is bumbling in front of him.
That should probably have more chance of success than the action from the madhouse against Evo Morales now.
It could be that Merkel is also denied overflight rights if a tax evader is suspected in an economic delegation
