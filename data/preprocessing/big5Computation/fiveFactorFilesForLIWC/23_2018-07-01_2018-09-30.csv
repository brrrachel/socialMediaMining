Obviously missing here: @CSU and #Seehofer!

And is that what #Nahles has proudly announced for days? The buck is promoted to top gardener! # Maassen becomes State Secretary. Goodbye to #SPD.
And what does the #SPD pay?
I fear him.
Please take that for what it is: a warning
My question: will this be an acceptable or indecent deal? Between #Merkel #Seehofer #Nahles # Maassen Will this ultimately be a win for #Democracy or another #GroKo disaster
