"@OlafScholz: &quot;Most refugees are not in #Europe. We have to work to ensure that those who have found shelter in neighboring countries have access to homes, schools and work, and do not have to live in camps for decades.&quot; #Humboldtrede"
"@OlafScholz on parliamentary-controlled common European armed forces: &quot;Even if there are still many questions to be resolved, this step must come: The time is right.&quot; #Humboldtrede"
"@OlafScholz: &quot;#Europa has to strengthen the criteria for its trade policy in order to anchor it in free trade agreements with many countries: respect for the core labor standards of the ILO, environmental standards, and respect for human rights in the global supply chains as well.&quot; #Humboldtrede"
@OlafScholz on the French variant of the financial transaction tax: &quot;The income from this tax could flow to the EU and reduce the national contributions to the EU budget. This would make the tax interesting for countries that would hardly generate any income from it themselves.&quot;
"@OlafScholz on European tax policy: &quot;When dealing with large corporations and their tax avoidance strategies, the #EU is currently able to demonstrate how successful a common presence can be in a global economy.&quot; #Humboldtrede"
"@OlafScholz to the European public: &quot;We are dealing with 28 (soon to be 27) monologues about #Europe. It cannot stay that way. In the best case, European public means that national glasses play a smaller role.&quot; #Humboldtrede"
@OlafScholz: &quot;No single state in #Europe has the strength without the #EU to keep control over its own development in the future order of the world. Even Germany not with its 80 million inhabitants. Europe must be united and strong. &quot; #Humboldtrede
@OlafScholz: &quot;The #EU advocates peaceful coexistence on the European continent. But not only there. We also have the task of campaigning for a multilateral peace order in the world.&quot; #Humboldtrede
@OlafScholz: &quot;The European Union is not only held together by interests; it is a union of values. This term is important to me.&quot; #Humboldtrede

Work has to be worthwhile. We have to make sure that people with low incomes have more net in their wallets.
We need a functioning housing allowance. Nobody may be driven into basic security by exploding rents.
Children have to get out of social assistance. The experience of being a Hartz4 child shapes life.
We need citizen benefit as a basic security. Developed for those who need support and not designed from the perspective of the abuser.
A lot has been said about the future of our welfare state since our debate camp. Andrea Nahles has now fleshed out her idea:
"Questionable statement by @juhessen about the incident: That was just 50% politics, 50% party. 50% party - on the commemoration day of the #Reichspogromnacht?! With a Wehrmacht song and homophobic statements ?! What do @cdu_hessen and @CDU say? pic.twitter.com/4YPFrmnhFx"

üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ at our party congresses or the #dc it is always a blast! #spd
. @ larsklingbeil at #SPDDC: 3/4 of the program are the result of suggestions from the party. Thank you! You have determined the topics that we are discussing here. And I would also like to thank everyone else who is here today and who brings important impulses. Nice that you are all there!
"With them it&#39;s about illegal donations, man, you will .."
". @ LarsKlingbeil at #SPDDC: Peter Fox sings: &#39;What you don&#39;t like, do it again&#39;. This does not only apply to structures, communication and participation in the party. This also applies to our positions. We have to make decisions here. Make it clear what the SPD stands for."
. @ larsklingbeil at the #SPDDC: This #debate camp is a milestone in the realignment of the SPD. It is about making the SPD fit for the future. With new ideas and a new political style. pic.twitter.com/eBBu557TNT
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: Will create new basic security. From the perspective of the people who need it. The subsistence level must never be called into question.
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We will leave Hartz IV behind.
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We need a &quot;Social State Reform 2025&quot;. This includes: civil servants and the self-employed in pension insurance. We need citizen insurance. We need a right to further training.
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We need a reform of the system and not just reforms in the system. Without bans on thinking. We are here for this.
"Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: Or the topic of the welfare state. My message today is that we need a major, far-reaching reform of the welfare state. Only the further development and optimization of the existing is not enough."
Periscope is one offer among many. More watch it on facebook live and most on our website. #factscheck #spddc
"Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We also want to discuss this here. Some ideas are already on the table, like the proposal for a basic income year that @LarsKlingbeil made."
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: Time is a question of distribution and justice. There cannot be two classes! Between those who can afford time and those who are driven in their work. And that is the task of the SPD!
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: People rightly feel that they don&#39;t have enough time for their own lives. That&#39;s what many employee surveys say. Almost everyone in our country wants more time!
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: Or when it comes to time. Time issues are contested. Time is fought over. And the SPD is fighting for this time. To harmonize work and life.
"Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: socially just climate protection, that&#39;s what the SPD stands for!"
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: The question of power also has to be asked in relation to coping with climate change. The Paris climate agreement has decided a specific climate target. Now it&#39;s about implementing these goals.
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: The global digital corporations can no longer avoid appropriate taxation. We need fair digital taxation. Best international. If that doesn&#39;t work: European. pic.twitter.com/zLrRCaD8lc
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: How do we tame digital capitalism? I say: we have to break the data monopolies. The data treasures in the hands of a few must be accessible to everyone. And at the same time the personal data are protected.

Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: For that we will go to the European elections next year with @KatharinaBarley and @UdoBullmann at the top!
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We need investments in Europe. We need minimum social standards. Must ensure equivalent living conditions in Europe.
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We notice that Europe is drifting apart. But that&#39;s not because of the refugees. This is due to the social inequalities in Europe!
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: A Europe that works together is the answer. A Europe of solidarity is the answer. A strong Europe is the answer. Europe is the answer.
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: And we have to unite internationally. In Europe we have to stop being small-scale. And that means: voting foreign policy decisions in Europe by a majority! And we need a European army.
"Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: The SPD has to open up to new alliances. With NGOs, unions and social movements. Because the progressive forces all work for themselves. Nationalists are destroying our world order in step!"
Andrea #Nahles at #SPDdc: We meet at a time when our old world order is gradually dissolving. Liberal and democratic Europe is challenged. We accept this challenge!
"Andrea #Nahles at the #SPDdc: Today, here at our #Debattencamp, we are starting to shape the future and to steer it in better, more human, more solidarity paths."

Lars Klingbeil is making it clear everywhere that he wants and wants to enable debate. Debate camp is a place. The portal is another decentralized option.
"That is exactly what we are concerned with - and we find that Lars makes very clear and understandable proposals and opens up perspectives (including the welfare state, digitization, climate, etc.). We want to discuss all of this at the debate camp. Do you come too? üòä"
"Hey, but there is also the debate portal for that. There should be an explicit debate on these topics: https://debattenportal.spd.de/"

"At the same time, there are terms such as &#39;parity&#39; that put more complex relationships in one word - in this case: contributions to statutory health insurance are paid equally by employees. 2.2"
"This is a good objection: clear language in politics is not only very important for us - and not always easy to manufacture, especially when it comes to complex issues. We are always trying (and more and more) to use clearer language. 1.2"

What about Lars&#39; suggestions are too vague for you?
Because...? ü§î
Lars raised many points in his text. Which did not convince you?
But the article cited does not pose any substantive solutions either. What do you think of the substantive questions that Lars raises?
Lars is demanding more than just correcting individual adjustments. The article aims to show what we have to speak openly about; at the debate camp and on the debate portal.
"The question of what comes after HartzIV is openly discussed at the debate camp and also raised by Lars in the article. From our point of view, all wings, currents and opinions should contribute and find themselves in the renewal."
But that&#39;s exactly one of the key demands of the article: More debate! And that&#39;s exactly why Lars and Andrea started the debate camp. There should be open discussion. https://debattencamp.spd.de

We find that the article does raise questions. Then what the future welfare state should look like. What we can do about child poverty. How we can fairly involve society in digitization (keyword: machine tax) etc. Don&#39;t you think?
