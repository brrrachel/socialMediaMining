The next trick GroKo came up with was to prevent the loading of Snowden # NSA-PUA. Protection of the services obviously goes against education.

Expert Rieger in the # NSA-PUA: Secret services behave like mafia in a legal department
Expert Prof. Waidner explains in the # NSA-PUA the &quot;state of black art&quot; in the surveillance of the Internet and gives recommendations.
"In the # NSA-PUA, the opposition addresses late &amp; incomplete submissions. BND and BfV in particular need to make improvements."
"In the evening we go to the BND summer festival. Unfortunately without accompaniment. But with the density of secret services there, I certainly won&#39;t be alone for long."
"Now in the # NSA-PUA: Expert hearing on the technique of mass surveillance, before the opposition made another attempt to load Snowden."

@DanielLuecking We are again requesting that Snowden witness be properly summoned. Let&#39;s see what GroKo now has an excuse?
