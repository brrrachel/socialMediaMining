"@Doener None. You can only govern in democracy if you are ready to vote with your parliamentary group and party, except for conscience"

"@Doener Like almost all MdB, I only vote against my group on issues of conscience. Would be the case with grid locks, not with LSR in this form"

"@VQuaschning it depends: if old power plants are decommissioned, it is not a problem"
@NiklasSchinerl But others have already tried that! :-)
@orangesolar we already have a mechanism in law that will apply if the expansion is too slow
"@ProfKemfert @orangesolar Coal is also to blame, but in December the stock exchange was at 3.5 c&#39;t wg negative prices between Christmas and New Year"
"@orangesolar @vquaschning, please stay serious: 02/13 was almost at level 02/12 and in summer the expansion always goes through the roof"
@orangesolar Electricity is cheaper on the stock exchange because it often has to be launched when nobody needs it. We subsidize abroad
Thanks to @LutzSteffen for the encouragement. Just sit on the train and then you can
"@Biogasrat see me 100% confirmed! Expansion goals are achieved, criticism of a lack of coordination eg with network expansion: I have always complained"
@orangesolar @vquaschning again more expansion this year than by corridor. It&#39;s just stupid that almost all jobs are gone anyway
2/3 of the PV in Germany has been in the last 3 years: because of expansion brakes. Now we need electricity price brakes!
@orangesolar @vquaschning Talk from the strangle lid hurts me and excites me: 2/3 all PV in D built in the last 3 years. Expanding record!
@VQuaschning I am for that too and have said that many times
@ TheBug0815 @alemaotejano we will discuss everything
@DaGaula we will clarify this with those responsible: where there is a will there is a way!
"@alemaotejano well, and where do you think it should go? It&#39;s there ..."

"@kpEschert why? The law is now being passed. If the inquiry makes us more clever, it will be changed, I think that&#39;s ok"
@ mapro67 Chapter nuclear power in D is completed step by step. Chapter EE is just beginning. Therefore we have to avoid mistakes
@Journaille apparently I was able to make suggestions with these employees that convinced Sage rotgrün in Lower Saxony

"So far, above all, positive reactions to our proposal for a repository. If we can do this by consensus, it will have a great peaceful effect!"

@schroeder_k It was super nice with you. Even if it wasn&#39;t quite enough: thanks for your efforts!
"@UlrichKelber, of course, because fossil fuels can guarantee delivery at any time and in the long term, but PV and wind cannot"
@ haraldo1960 @ulrichkelber the falling prices come from the fact that the electricity is there at certain times and nobody wants it.

"@LongoFL No, because red-green had no plans for implementation (networks / storage / costs). When Gabriel left in 2009, there was still no concept"
@LongoFL That&#39;s the way it is: I only publicly mentioned the trillion once. The cry of red / green made her well known
"@nhbot @WWSPower Thank you. But nuclear fuel rods have already been taxed by Merkel / Schaubkle, unfortunately not by red / green"
@WWSPower There is only one problem: debt brake in the GG!
"@WWSPower Yes, but unfortunately the electricity is produced even when it is not needed: Negative electricity prices on the exchange."
"@erik_donner Yes, on the Internet. I have respect for him, but I am convinced that Helmut Müller can do it better."
@ thomasbraun18 the large corporations pay as much as the others. You only pay little if you are energy-intensive. I want to increase that
@ MeenzerJung1 Thank you!
"@WWSPower I listen to everyone and even answer you if I can. In the end, however, I have to do politics in such a way that EW succeeds overall."
"@WWSPower That&#39;s why I want to brake now and then reform with calm. If the SPD / Greens join in, the predictability is back."
@WWSPower The return on PV comes from self-consumption. And I can&#39;t do anything for the EU.
"@WWSPower In 2012 we had 2.4 GW of onshore wind, in 2013 it will be 3.0, and in 2014 even up to 5.0. Even with less growth would continue"
@WWSPower That banks have become more cautious comes from the great cries of crisis that the industry has made according to my suggestions
"@WWSPower Now you avoid: The nuclear waste does not come from me, but I try to store it safely"
@WWSPower @orangesolar My goal was that we install about 3000 MW PV per year and we will probably be significantly above that
@WWSPower @orangesolar how can you know that there will be no expansion in March when the month is just 1/3 over?
@spd_wor welcome as new followers. In a good democratic two-way relationship!
For the OB election today in Wiesbaden I keep my fingers crossed for Helmut Müller: He is the best candidate and was one of the first in the new BMU in 1987!
@Dscherid @zdf I&#39;m also excited
"@UlrichKelber what&#39;s that? I have expressed myself x-subject in interviews, but the responsibility for the department applies in papers"
@DieSolarGmbH they got it from the start
@UlrichKelber @dpomondi Logical: because as a minister you can only submit written proposals within the scope of your departmental responsibility
@ migrate89 SPD has since truthfully claimed that I would endanger industrial jobs and Greens have become strangely quiet
@ migrate89 were made for energy-intensive and at the same time suggested that price brakes should also be introduced for network charges.
"@ migrate89 before Christmas I announced review of all industry exceptions, on January 28th. I have a proposal to reduce the EEG"
@dpomondi @ulrichkelber I had in my electricity price PK on January 28th. explicitly said that I also apply brakes to network charges
@ migrate89 how did you come up with this brilliant idea?
@orangesolar that&#39;s why I want lignite to pay the EEG surcharge in the future. Hope GRÜNE and SPD are involved
"@orangesolar Own consumption from fossil fuels, industry exceptions are restricted, even with fossil electricity"
@orangesolar the profits of the Big 4 are taxed like others (RWE profit was &quot;before&quot; taxes. Price brake also applies to ... 1/2
"@orangesolar I will no longer answer if you say untruths: cuts affect industry, self-consumption also conventionally"
"@mzurhorst @zdf they already exist, but they are often in bad shape because coal has become so cheap and emissions trading is not working"
"@fdpweimar Well, the network operator. There are quite a lot if you take everything from transmission to distribution networks together"
@WWSPower not at all. At PV it hung up in February with 230 MW
@Machsweg flees do that big 4 you do not make so much profits
@germanpellets hope we can keep it
"@orangesolar @zdf they probably don&#39;t, because Vattenfall has just said it will cut 1,500 people"
"Together with @NadineSchoen, Annette Hübinger, Alex Funk and Marcus Uhl we are a strong team!"

"National Forum on Biodiversity with WWF, BDI, DIHK. New ways to preserve nature and the environment"
"@OekoErnst that&#39;s for sure. But also through the 3 organic government debt since 1969 vw profits have arisen, and yet they are to be blamed"
@Dunehopper the point is: until a few weeks ago @UlrichKelber wanted to make everyone believe that the EEG surcharge will decrease in autumn
@OekoErnst I attach great importance to the fact that my figures are factual
@ larsbakker2 You are right! But at least I wanted to show @ulrichkelber that I can refute his arguments
@UdoSieverding I gradually groped my way u take back little. I only gradually recognized the entire cost range
"Only then will we make the right decisions that are essential for success, @UlrichKelber"
"What @UlrichKelber doesn&#39;t understand: If you want the success of the energy transition, you have to talk honestly about cost and problems."
"@UlrichKelber in particular, I&#39;m flat that my predecessors left me a non-working ETS. Very bad. #fail"
"@UlrichKelber now I can: eg the offshore connections, the 3 HVDCs (total approx. 11 billion) and line reinforcements due to PV decentralized"
"@UlrichKelber You jump from one to the other. New power plants are also being built for backup, but they are not profitable."
@HeHoffmann Batteries for wind will unfortunately not be available that quickly. And power to gas will initially cost billions
"@HeHoffmann all previous bills assume rising electricity prices, instead they will decrease. Also because of oversupply"
"@ MichaelBrand15 that too, of course!"
"@Ryan_Politics, of course. I was nominated 4 weeks ago!"
@drmfuchs thank you!
@Rakkox thank you! We met and yet in the main station without me knowing it!
@martindelius Thank you! The Chancellor is second to none in every respect!
@ thobi75 @ulrichkelber that was definitely a serious mistake. We should learn from that
@UlrichKelber and on the basis is the exchange electricity price of 4.5 c&#39;t on average
"@UlrichKelber does more than just organic. Then there are costs for backup, EE-related network expansion, research, etc"
@UlrichKelber It&#39;s very simple: Remuneration already paid and still to be counted until 2042 based on current additions and applicable rates.
@ MichaelBrand15 but only because we have reduced the feed-in tariffs against the greatest resistance
"@UlrichKelber On the contrary, and word gets around more and more. I have exactly named the assumptions for the organic. It could get worse."
"@UlrichKelber Because you wanted to know the actual costs. I have now quantified cost risk, but not even the worst case"
@Elektronews Who could it be that represents neither the interests of the conventional nor of the EE?
"@FranziBr Because the whole world is watching us, we have to be damn good. Not like BER or Elbe Symphonie"
"@AHaardt was forecast to remain the same in 2012, in the end there was an increase of 50%"
@HOMEsphaere @franzalt are indispensable.
@AHaardt Only verifiable evidence for forecasts is the occurrence of reality. The increase in the EEG surcharge was always underestimated
@Dillerjohann Exactly: Always afterwards. But those who have been wrong often should be careful!
Many say that the cost of renewables will be lower than feared. They are the same whose forecasts have always been completely wrong!
"@IniOsterath ok, you are welcome to continue filling my TL, but you can also send a letter with your arguments!"

"Thanks for the great debate today. Even if I couldn&#39;t answer: it was exciting! We can do something, the energy transition succeeds!"
"@red_hardliner So it is, and therefore my draft law does not make fracking easier, it makes it more difficult!"
"@tobiasschloo Unfortunately not, because every position has its own view of fracking! I personally don&#39;t think it is safe in Germany at the moment."
"Dear @Oliver_Krischer, unfortunately fracking is not currently prohibited because red-green did nothing and neither did Sigmar Gabriel. #fail"
@bund_net The draft law is fully in line with the UBA from September that I have called out to. Nobody protested back then.
@DaGaula that&#39;s right.
@cdu_saar thank you very much! Greetings from Berlin!
@UlrichKelber Heard you would have been playing around in the DLF this morning ?!
For months I&#39;ve been promoting caution when it comes to fracking. Too bad that red / green want to prevent more environmental protection for election reasons
"Because the opposition fears that I could &quot;steal&quot; an issue from them, they are polemic against my proposals to limit fracking"
"@PenZiuM @acbrennergmbh Please count the number of requests for 1 day. If I answered all of them, I couldn&#39;t do anything else. #amtseid"
@orangesolar Exactly: Do you remember who was Minister of the Environment at the time?
@hatschutschu nothing is allowed what is prohibited
"@friendoftibet as long as we cannot guarantee it, it must not be done"
Shortly after 7:00 am I am in the morning magazine about fracking. The protection of people and the environment is paramount!
@SunTsu That can be good!
"@Einstueckkaese UVP is unfortunately not available. And that&#39;s why the UVP is new. In addition, a general ban in drinking water protection areas"
"@ f60_8 We put up signposts! But m, al honestly, should we leave everything as it is? Then fracking would be possible at any time!"
@andreasdotorg I helped that the coal industry was stopped because of the earthen planes (for me in the constituency)
@LongoFL @Elektronews I am sure that the Federal Council approves my fracking proposals. Otherwise it would be possible in general!
@Elektronews @lotilie Buy her new glasses! But then she sees you with different eyes! :-)
"@UlrichKelber it was not introduced by me, but as far as I know from red-green"
@UlrichKelber because everyone I ask answers that there is unfortunately no solution. The electricity has to be sold now!
"@UdoSieverding are, if nothing changes in the applicable legal situation. But turning is much, much more!"
"@UdoSieverding Well then, go. But unfortunately it is only the number of feed-in tariffs due for all plants built by 2022"
@UdoSieverding then tell us what you think the entire energy transition will cost until 2042! In the worst case!
"@TanteJay that weren&#39;t rule of law either, back then. :-) with us you can fight for it all democratically, see gay rights"
"@TanteJay that&#39;s the problem: everyone decides for himself what he thinks is civil disobedience and then doesn&#39;t pay taxes, for example"
"@IPKlaus @tiefseher @ tiger747 so far, all forecasts were pinkish optimistic. I was the first to give realistic numbers"
"@BergmannHB I had it through Stadtwerke München. Otherwise, we have an attentiveness until we have agreed, the faster ..."
"@TanteJay And how! Everyone can come, especially the stronger, richer, more powerful ones who can afford violence!"
"@GruegerS you are wrong. If the factory used to mess up a river, it was at the expense of the environment"
"@evelinelemke uncertainty comes from the fact that nobody knows exactly what is coming: the faster we agree, the faster it will be over!"
"@GruegerS @ mapro67 You have to separate total costs for the citizens from those for the environment, which are higher. But I don&#39;t slow down!"
@ mapro67 because the energy transition affects electricity &amp; heat &amp; transport equally and how the total costs must not lose sight!
@GarreltDuin @minister_remmel @ e4motion I am convinced of that. Looking forward to good conversations!
"@EnergieInsider no, everyone is doing good business! With yields around 5 or 6% it would still be nice. #sustainability"
"@EnergieInsider nonsense in cans! Why should a new wind turbine be uneconomical if you only get 30,000 leases instead of 50,000?"
@UdoSieverding farmers and tenants at Schalke
"@The_Freazer I&#39;m really sorry about this morning, but I have to go there too. You have - I think - somehow invited :-)"
"@FilipFatz @alexzeyer Greetings back, was just at the CDU Wuppertal for the New Year&#39;s reception!"
@Pausanias where did you invite me to? So tomorrow I&#39;m in Saarlouis and in Gersheim ...
@wahnsinn is because nobody knows whether and when the risks can be safely excluded.
"@ mampel2000 this is an insult and if it repeats, I will block you"
"@fassstaerke Yes, of course: because together with BMWi Rösler I opened the medium-sized company initiative to save energy"
"@haastrecht If you don&#39;t invite me, I can&#39;t come! :-)"
@ mapro67 I am very satisfied with the debate because awareness of problems is increasing everywhere. Many constructive suggestions
@ BDR_74 Thank you!
"@haastrecht No, not public."
@BjoernButh I came into office 9 months ago and sowed. Now comes the time when the fruits ripen. ! :-)
Now get me off the field. Important talks on electricity price brakes and ETS tomorrow. @peersteinbrueck is slowly in top form !!!
"@CDUBiblis Yes, see you soon in Biblis! Beautiful evening!"
"@ haraldo1960 @UlrichKelber if it were a matter of course, it could have been in the law long ago."
@new__energies rotgrün also did not ensure that EIAs came from coal mining. There were earthquakes in Saarland and red-green did nothing
@ sausage commission @ extra3 I don&#39;t understand. The best cabbage sausages are available from kale!
@JacoGeurts @maartenhajer How nice! I wish you all the best!
"@ChristophLieven we prescribe UVP for every fracking, regardless of whether for oil, gas, shale gas or geothermal energy"
@tobiasschloo Thank you!
"@MCJordanM Thank you, that was a very pleasant show!"
"@UdoSieverding because I&#39;m such an active guy. So far about 35 appointments in NRW, everything comes together here: coal, industry, RE,"
@LeBoeck but research is funded. We have several pilot plants and soon I will put a new one into operation in Lower Saxony
"Ultimately, @UdoSieverding called for a consensus between Rösler and Altmaier, and they got it! :-)"
@UdoSieverding it is normal and ok that it is discussed for a long time between departments. SPD / Greens have immediate
@UdoSieverding
@Minister_Remmel @ e4motion @garreltduin I am convinced that I can achieve a good result with NRW!
@Chotschn from me both!
@FFruit thanks!

"@ somuchwin_1 I can&#39;t always answer everyone, but sometimes it just fits"
"@JTrittin the other way around, shoes become: GREEN have been polemicizing against offshore wind power for months - now you&#39;ve got the salad"
"@JTrittin knows very well that such decisions are not made overnight, but are prepared over months."
"@ somuchwin_1 power to gas, CHP, storage promotion. That calculated until 2042"
"@ somuchwin_1 adds up to 666 bn. In addition, costs for networks (only EW part), offshore liability, backup, thermal insulation etc., e-mobility, power,"
"@ somuchwin_1 66 billion are already counted for EE, +250 billion for systems that are well installed. + at least 350 billion for new builders built by 2022."
@ Markussc07 And how! Greetings from Berlin !
"@Peter_Jelinek My line is clear from the start: I want the energy transition to be successful, but it has to be affordable. Unfortunately, not everyone likes it"
@ Zoido4Design @falkjan you can&#39;t say that in general: but it also occurs when it is not needed
"@ Zoido4Design @falkjan no I don&#39;t think so, but in the last 10 years they have been completely wrong and always said that it is rising strongly"
"@orangesolar @andidederichs 1. Thank you for being happy until then! :-) 2. the conversion may cost something, but it has to be affordable"
@HeHoffmann the accusation of lying is honorary and I ask you to take it back by tomorrow noon. Otherwise I have to block you
"@ Falkjan yes, of course, most of them have already been withdrawn. They correspond to the exchange electricity price"
"@bund_net and nobody, because financing was unsolved and all forecasts were so far blue-eyed"
@bund_net I can give you 200 pages of interviews where I have been taking advantage of the energy transition prices since May. But no agency is interested
@neumann_holger @bmu_de @bvmw_news @peersteinbrueck :-))
@neumann_holger @bmu_de @bvmw_news Not guaranteed for me! @Peersteinbrueck spoke in front of me
@ TheBug0815 you have not forgotten! - Great!
"@ TheBug0815 @kungler yes, but that was not an intention, it was because the 1std program was behind schedule and I had to go to my guests."
@WetzelMichael_ The problem with eco tax is that our pension insurance is financed.
"@OttoCarsten Merit order cannot be combated: if there is too much electricity, it cannot be used, but must be paid for at EE."
"@OttoCarsten They stay what they are. My suggestion is: Solos 1.5%, ie whoever gets 150 a month will only get 148 for 1 year"
"@daemonenwelt they will wean themselves off these sections, because nuclear power will in future be one of the most expensive energies."
"@HOMEsphaere @franzalt Returns in the double-digit range and leases of wind turbines, which are around 50,000 euros, for the success of EE"
@kaymar_de in total there are now 2 trillion and everyone has contributed to it
"If we hadn&#39;t taken the path of horrendous national debt completely irresponsibly since 1969, we would be much better off today"
@ Zoido4Design by 2 Bio is nowhere to speak. But 1bio is also very nice. Figures in the FAZ
@HeHoffmann @longofl @udosieverding that is demanded and supported by all red and yellow state governments
"@BuergerTK now you totally falsified my tweet: I said &quot;at a lower cost&quot;, ie I accept that there are costs"
@terveer is exactly part of the problem: you shouldn&#39;t first calculate yourself and then complain that everything is going wrong
@ bigbrother_25 @marlies_uken I thought switching would be so easy. I have it checked
@Rainer_Klute that&#39;s a word!
"@UdoSieverding read my interview in the FAZ, p. 11, there are exact numbers."
@LongoFL @udosieverding There have been industrial sectors since Trittin and offshore liability was explicitly requested by Rotgelb in countries
@LongoFL @udosieverding then let&#39;s talk about how we can relieve consumers and still create an energy transition!
". @ Marlies_Uken the argument is not serious: I am 100% for energy transition, but at a lower cost. No matter what it costs!"
"@UdoSieverding You should protect consumers. what is saved is the exchange price (costs for conv. electricity), which is deducted automatically"
"@RicoLoos can be seen like this, but then Hartz IV would be lower for us because we would have to co-finance higher rates in other countries ..."
@ Lincoln_1980 you&#39;re right. But anyone who wanted to blockade today would be surprised
How did you get that? The Federal Council is constructive and is not suitable for blocking!
"@MKreutzfeldt is his right, but I explained that what is questioned has to be compensated for by new suggestions."
@Piratenfrank thank you!
Today there is great support in the group for the concept of the electricity price brake. I am happy about the unity and encouragement of my colleagues!
Internalize @HOMEsphaere @franzalt. But the process has to be organized in such a way that it remains affordable. I can&#39;t see that
@HOMEsphaere @franzalt Of course we need the energy transition. And it is right that in future we will not externalize costs but rather
"@BergmannHB But that must be a problem for you, because I definitely didn&#39;t do anything! Have a nice evening!"
@OttoCarsten protest against? That the energy transition remains affordable?
"@RalphPittich Best regards from Berlin, that was a great black beer tapping. And it didn&#39;t even splash! :-)"
@BergmannHB I checked: I didn&#39;t block you. You can see that from the fact that I get your tweets and react to them
@BergmannHB I only block those who tweet outrageously insulting or obscene. And rightly so
@ mapro67 unfortunately that is priceless u everyone knows that. So we have to think about what we can pay and how to get a lot of EE for it
@ mapro67 Benefit for the environment and the climate would be greatest if we would switch the entire energy supply to RE in the next 5 years
@TWK_Karlsruhe we are negotiating about electricity price brakes. It must not be that the energy transition eats their children
@dani_brandt I&#39;m already being advised by my followers ...
@uteein that will change ... :-)
"@ TheBug0815 I&#39;m talking straight away, but maybe you&#39;ll get me to grab it"
@Cyrus_McDugan it eats time especially when you do it aimlessly and haphazardly
"@GermanPazifist Not really: permanent means that you always have the opportunity, non-stop means that you do it all the time"
"@ mapro67 we can differ in a lot of ways, but I don&#39;t like &quot;talking&quot; so much ..."
@ 59karli82 you have to decide for yourself what to do with it ...
". @ JSchmanck Yes, diversity of opinion in real time and participation in permanence!"
"The added value of #Twitter does not consist in the sheer number, but in the new quality of the dialogue - as long as you get involved!"
For two weeks now I have been asking what the maximum EEG surcharge may be. Unfortunately I have not yet received a single answer.
"If you want the energy transition, you have to be honest. Too often the forecasts were wrong and the critics triumphed."
"@mpucher So far, no green or red politician has answered the question of how high the EEG surcharge may be. What is your opinion?"
"@Hermann_Ott @Oliver_Krischer I do, but that&#39;s not an argument that the EC levy rises above all forecasts."
"@Oliver_Krischer coal prices are falling, gas is likely to follow suit. But just say: How high can the EEG surcharge be?"
"@bengie_d Since I&#39;m Minister of the Environment, it would be bad style if I tweeted about the responsibilities of other ministers. I have an opinion."
@ProfKemfert @felixmatthes That would be an idea. But then ETS is finally dead. That&#39;s why I&#39;m trying backloading.
@felixmatthes and do you accept liability for this? I am politically responsible when it happens. That is the difference. Unfortunately.
@felixmatthes I ask you quite specifically: Are you ready to guarantee that the EE elements + taxes make up less than 10% and
@felixmatthes I have now explained and substantiated it twice very precisely. They constantly attack me across the board and don&#39;t prove anything. Unfortunately.
@ProfKemfert @felixmatthes everyone thought possible. Unfortunately
@ProfKemfert @felixmatthes The problem is that only the green electricity components can be regulated. And have risen more than
@felixmatthes @ARD_BaB the opposite is the case. Unfortunately.
"@felixmatthes The main problem is that &quot;experts&quot; kept saying that the levy would not increase or would increase only moderately, and then it was"
@ProfKemfert @felixmatthes offshore goes up and unfortunately also self-consumption (especially by companies)
"@ProfKemfert @felixmatthes Yes, but the price was 3.5 in December and the summer with negative prices is still to come. Expansion wind"
@felixmatthes @ARD_BaB nente and it does not lower the electricity price.
@tdzblog I made suggestions ... cut 700 million
@LindaCulture congratulation and celebration! We go for it!
@oliverreporter we work ...
@oliverreporter Well watched! You will be helped here! :-)
@ mapro67 I have repeatedly defended the feed-in priority and it stays that way!
"@Biogasrat why? With PV, the energy transition (addition) continues briskly, even though the remuneration is very degressive!"
@solarfalke You should read my papers: the solar industry is the only one except for most cuts
@StefanLeifert I always knew that I was unique :-))!
"If the electricity price brake could be resolved quickly, we could concentrate more on the positive side of the energy transition"
"@UlrichKelber @ aotto1968_2 The Altmaier / rösler position is available, an SPD / green position is not yet. See today&#39;s mirror"
@ FritzReuter16 my forecasts were not wrong so far because I am based on facts and not on wishes
"@bennyheizer that can be good but until then we have a problem. In addition, world market coal becomes cheap because of fracking in the USA"
"@orangesolar, unfortunately, that&#39;s not true, because then there are still the costs for the new construction (currently 1.8 billion years)"
@orangesolar on the green proposal is a good thing. I&#39;m curious to see if they participate
Now get me off the field. Read you! Thanks for the discussion!
I now have about 100 replies and still have no answer to the question of where the limit for the EEG surcharge lies.
"Since October Trittin, Roth, H.Heil and many more have been campaigning with the increase in the levy. I was very disappointed."
"I want the energy transition to be successful, so I have to be serious and predictable."
Now we are at 5.277 ct and the 7 ct are coming into view. Therefore the question &quot;where is the limit&quot; is absolutely justified.
"If one had offered a surcharge of 5 ct as max in 2005, everyone would have happily accepted because EE supporters always said that it would never come to that."
"@lotilie yes, but does that mean that you can continue to burden the citizens as you wish? And if not: where do you think the limit is?"
@PiratenOS the comment is 2 weeks old: congratulations that you have already noticed! :-) #quick memory
"@ Lincoln_1980 @ meikel40474 not only depends on me, but I find it difficult to give"
"@ meikel40474 yes, keep your fingers crossed for me: I am also willing to compromise, but in the end the calculation has to be correct!"
@ meikel40474 I&#39;ve really made suggestions: # electricity price brake
Would I be interested to know if and what @peersteinbrueck would do for citizens and businesses against rising electricity prices? So far radio silence
@Bastian_Atzger @KapTrips Thank you very much for the kind words and the dialogue!
@mmmmelle I kept talking about saving in the 2nd half of the year - red / green accused me of ridiculing the citizens
"@ MajorTom1956 @LosLobbos I&#39;m following a few, but the more there are, the more confusing the TL becomes"
@Jan_Ellerbrock You are right. And that&#39;s why we should learn from mistakes!
"@LosLobbos So-so, the opposition can&#39;t think of anything, unfortunately I have already eaten my dinner and the weather is no help either!"
@Minister_Remmel Dear ma: I&#39;m delighted and also: in many things we are pulling in the same direction! And often in the same direction!
@Minister_Remmel Your wait a few days later! :-) but maybe we should do something neat together.
"@MBL_de You mustn&#39;t look at the questions, you have to look at the answers !!!"
@larsklingbeil you&#39;re wrong: I promised that for the first time 1 week ago and that should come true! :-)
@larsklingbeil now soon! Reinhard Grindel worked very successfully for it!
@BerndSchreiner I am very much in favor of dialogue and we not only want a ban in drinking water protection areas but also an EIA obligation everywhere else
"@DemokrateZ but now it goes ahead, we will make law"
@SenorNiceGuy if someone wants to fill it up: that would be really stupid and would impress me zero
@JoernPL Thank you!
@felixmatthes @ARD_BaB offshore liability cover is new and capped at 0.25ct. Switchable loads include power components
"@felixmatthes The other 5% come from taxes on levy (VAT, electricity), offshore liability (0.25ct) and load regulation that can be switched off"
"@felixmatthes So far, all increases have been extremely above the forecasts. 1.7 can happen if the exchange price is between 4.5 - 4.0."
@felixmatthes @ARD_BaB I would be happy to have these and other inaccurate allegations corrected by you to my address
"@ProfKemfert Yes, I know that the contribution will decrease. But I&#39;m not sure whether rising stock prices will not be passed on."
"@felixmatthes @ARD_BaB In addition, the electricity price is not currently at 30 ct, but still below, so that 10% are less."
"@felixmatthes @ARD_BaB Switchable loads etc. added. And then? Unfortunately, your very general statements do not match the facts."
"@felixmatthes Unfortunately, you are dubious: The surcharge can increase up to 1.7 ct. Then there is VAT and electricity tax, offshore levy"
"@ProfKemfert I am in favor of ETS, but you have to explain that to me: the surcharge would decrease, but the price of electricity would increase. 0 Total"
@orangesolar I really wonder why they argue so flatly: Solar / PV in particular get off very well with the Rösler / Altmaier paper
"@ostarido You can see that at PV: Automatic degression and expansion continues, because PV is now installed for your own consumption."
"@HeHoffmann The first question is whether we should stop. To express yourself, express yourself :-). Then clarify how we can achieve that"
"@HeHoffmann Wrong, CSU supports electricity price brakes, difference only in detail"
"@ Chris_Felix_030 How do you know? I have been dealing with ALL aspects of the energy transition for 9 months, do &quot;experts&quot; do not."
". @ ARD_BaB @daserste No no argument, we solve problems together. Looking forward to my appearance in report from Berlin, ARD, at 6.30 p.m."
@lotilie Can it be that you didn&#39;t answer my question? One would only expect such things from politicians. :-)
"@oschulzra There are town halls, for example in Soegel, where this happens with rainwater. Many new buildings too!"
"@NicoleMaisch That is not fair: I am the first to have examined it, with reports and workshops, and now we are tightening the law"
@WolfgangC that is the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. We definitely need it and hopefully we will have it soon
@WireCraftServer I&#39;ve been doing this for months with expert reports and conferences
@rgeddert anytime and gladly
To everyone who thinks that I&#39;m too careful about fracking: I don&#39;t know any city or municipality that would accept fracking
"@tonifischer that&#39;s exactly what I do: a policy that is based on problems. When doing nothing, electricity prices explode: about 10% every year"
"@KonstantinNotz congratulations, even if the CDU has to win it, of course!"
@viciarg wide awake!
"@wusel @Reizzentrum No, we are very strict with fracking, stricter than most countries in Europe"
"We are much stricter with fracking than with coal mining, although there have been earthquakes and mine damage there in the past."
"@ haraldo1960 how proposal 2 works, nobody has explained to me yet: if there is more electricity than is needed, nobody will buy it!"
"@ Monokel1 It does not come, but it has been there for a long time !!! :-)"

@kritischergeist to me personally
"@ WowbaggerXX7 I discuss with everyone, but I don&#39;t allow myself to be insulted. Therefore you are blocked from now on: and bye! : - (("

@henrikMSL Best regards to all participants: The future belongs to us!
"@ hekate15 Both are equally important. Incidentally, the SPD and Greens accuse me of only thinking about the electricity price calculation of the citizens"
@ Kyra2001 Thank you !!!
@UdoSieverding what do you specifically suggest with regard to the exchange price?
@ sord3 I agree. But do you have any idea how high the EEG surcharge may be?
"@tessarakt In the future, the market premium for new plants will no longer apply"
@UdoSieverding That&#39;s exactly what the tweet shows!
"@oliverdasgupta yes, because otherwise I would have had 141 characters: Flexibility is key!"
"Protection of legitimate expectations: Investors need certainty that the energy transition will continue, 80 million citizens need certainty that electricity will remain affordable"
"@ SvenFischer12 The biogas stream is the most expensive (apart from geothermal energy, which does not yet play a role), but also the only renewable energy source that does not fluctuate."
@RichterPletten We can talk about anything if the SPD and the Greens contribute constructively. In the end the price brake has to work!
@RichterPletten with my electricity price brake does not necessarily have to build fewer wind turbines if returns are reasonable.
Energy transition is going digital: the Federal Network Agency is now also on Twitter at @netzausbau! Welcome: You are well connected here!
@jensrowold unfortunately the electricity prices in Denmark are even higher than ours!
@JuliaKloeckner But your video in Isar-Oberstein also not!
"@huettemann well, the federal government is auto-legitimated, Brussels is not yet"
@JuliaKloeckner probably mean that I ate 5 herrings !!! :-)
@JuliaKloeckner Greetings from Isar-Oberstein!
@UdoSieverding or in other words: most of the things are only afterwards!
@UdoSieverding The criticism in detail is of course the salt in the soup! But you have to come up with some things for granted! :-)
"@UdoSieverding What do you say now: agreement with Rösler, working group with countries, the matter is getting going!"
"@MartinGuenthner well, my advertising at the Hanseatic League was in vain. But we can talk again"
@Gerdbillen I am determined! You can see that everyone is now under pressure to move.
@UdoSieverding that will not happen so quickly because the technical problems are big and the liability is capped
@GermanPazifist is excellent and shows that the expansion of renewable energy is possible without a subsidy
"@Leo_Kuntscher Seriously, I have made suggestions: 500 million! The SPD, on the other hand, is storming and the Greens are hitting the bushes again!"
@UdoSieverding that depends on what the negotiations show: in the end the brakes have to work
@orangesolar Adding the PV was at an incredible record level for 3 years - it didn&#39;t help German companies! Now sustainable path comes about 3-4GW
@MartinGuenthner somehow I remember that on Monday you urgently wanted to submit a joint rösler / Altmaier paper
@ mapro67 we are now at 700 million
@ Tolomir2 @stefan_birkner @philipproesler we suggest that too
"@ Bolto85 why? Was at events in Schwalbach and Trier yesterday, hence now from Saarbrücken to Berlin"

"@MateRaspovic In any case, the first large industrial country in this radical form!"

"@angerreich Yes, it was not easy. But we don&#39;t do it for pleasure. I have opinion leadership because I named real problem"

@ janosch007 Completely wrong: nothing is possible what was previously prohibited!
@einfranz Because essential questions still have to be clarified in order to be able to assess this
That is why we completely ban fracking in drinking water protection areas and for the first time require UVP.
@ vincentkiefer why: I have long believed that fracking has no place in drinking water protection areas.
"@Sandra__N It was a great event: despite the many participants, it was very disciplined and informative"

"@scanlines Quatic, carnival joke, worse: Fracking must be prohibited in water protection areas, otherwise permits are clearly tightened."
@thinkpolitical and a great audience!
@Hermann_L thank you for the friendly welcome!
@petertauber @local editor if that&#39;s supposed to be tomorrow when I&#39;m in the area: best with me
@balaver read interview today in Figaro
With my college @delphinebatho At the SER symposium in Paris: a strong signal of our Cooperation in the Energy Transition!
"@Bastian_Atzger Yes, Ramsauer will be happy! I always type myself, we don&#39;t want to let people type! :-)"
@renebloch an Audi A8
"@DavidVaulont I want to reduce the exemptions, but the SPD is currently walling up!"
"With a car over paving stones, the tweeting goes on its own !!! Alaaf, Allez-Hopp and Helau!"
@JosHessels Alaaf !!!!!
"@willimeck yes, think so. What have I done?"
I don&#39;t think anyone would want the costs of the energy transition to get out of control - acceptance would weaken greatly
I think
@ stuttgartwest5 @renebloch Ok for the car class
@ Doppelgeist60 :-))
"@KarlHeinzWeber yes, it was also a fair program with informative contributions"
"@ Doppelgeist60 yes, the BMWi sent it after 5 p.m. on Friday, but nobody was there anymore. It would not have been spilled with email"
"@renebloch I travel by train more often, but the car is also my office and here I can work and make calls without disturbing others"
"@renebloch @das_rotesofa Yes, amazing what you can learn in my old age! :-) Tweets started too quickly because I&#39;m in the car"
@piratharburg a tweet starts too early
@piratharburg I&#39;m sitting in the car in the back seat and get shaken
"@ Kyra2001 Nä, I was in, in Hülzweiler and in Saarwellingen: More carnival is not possible!"
"@ Kyra2001 Nä, I was at the Kostümsi"
"Thanks to Hinnerk Baumgarten and the whole @das_rotesofa team for a very pleasant, informative and well-researched show! Top!"
Thanks to Hinner
Thanks to Hinnerk Bau
"@OliverNeerfeld Thank you, that was also due to the good show!"
"@ schra7 it&#39;s not necessarily about that: if the feed-in tariff is very low, it makes self-consumption and thus saves a lot."
"@ romme1933 I can&#39;t know! Renewables are inexhaustible and clean, but they cost too! That is why saving makes a lot of sense"
@UdoSieverding my tasks are all so easy that it is pure joy!
"@CoFi_juwi @franzalt EigenV is ok, but if the EEG surcharge ceases, it increases for everyone else. For example if the group buys a power plant"

@freyafall small steps often have a good effect!
@Biogasrat and I think it&#39;s a shame that you&#39;re working on the minister instead of making suggestions so that the energy transition is affordable
@Biogasrat Thank you. I assume that. Good cooperation in the future
"@Biogasrat Instead of pounding around, maybe you should apologize for your false claims"
@Biogasrat They confirm that the 1st tweet was boldly wrong and add new boldness: I was there for 1 hour despite a severe cold
@ PhilMu7 what is sleep? :-)
"@SAARTEXT @HeikoMaas We already have: BK Merkel meets with MPs every 6 months, BMU with colleagues, EE and network platforms at civil service level"
"@orangesolar @pv_forum Unfortunately wrong calculation: increase surcharge larger, because new construction and base effect also have to be taken into account"
@pv_forum Completely agree that PV will not be the price driver in 2013. But lower stock exchange price and expansion of wind and biogas.
@piratenflotte Thank you!
". @ Biogasrat Of course @peteraltmaier was there, talked and then listened to the 1st podium. Just find this misinformation dubious."
@alexandraendres It is 4.6% for the lowest incomes and inflation and EEG increases eat up the whole increase for pensioners.
The energy transition can only succeed if it becomes a public project. It&#39;s great that my securing the price of electricity is being discussed so lively!
@Gerdbillen @sigmargabriel The #vzbv should definitely play a role because it is close to people&#39;s problems
"@KomZe_Behaglich Problem is that the variable goes through the roof. Therefore it has to be fixed, everything else follows from it."
@ schra7 We had 3 years of solar expansion records with very high costs and the expansion is still high.
@Smud broom @GabiKostorz That&#39;s how it should come if my suggestions go through.
"@knut_l thanks for the flowers, and: the MoMa in ZDF u ARD is at least as good as the Moma in NY"
@Volker_Beck @mgrossebroemer That&#39;s how it is with us: on a good predecessor always do better successors!

@mpucher The efficiency guideline has been passed and Germany has agreed !!!
"Fracking: This draft law makes fracking in Germany more difficult, not easier! Environment and nature have priority"
"@mpucher Did the round table &quot;Stromsparen&quot;, a campaign and a network platform, but that was criticized by red / green as an imposition"
@hubertus_heil It is currently in progress and the next logical step!
@ Monokel1 Who is CL?
"@HeHoffmann the other way round: we have advanced the expansion of renewable energies very quickly, which is why we now have to pay costs"
"@PrivacyManager yes, but also the taxes are not increased arbitrarily if there are holes in the cash register"
@NEngemaier EXACTLY THAT I suggested reading it
"@ Schulte93 not at all, but do you know of any other proposal that brings prices under control"
@glouki Not quite yet: I want to prevent costs from getting out of hand. There are few countries that are so attractive for inv. are
"@UlrichKelber are we going to start with verbal judgments now? Exchange electricity prices are the cost of fossil fuels, including power plants. In D a few more c&#39;t"
"@UlrichKelber that is also true, nobody can know the cost of waiving because it is Va. Intangible costs"
I am the only one who makes suggestions. SPD has a double strategy: @UlrichKelber drives up costs and @hubertus_heil complains about price increases
Shortly after 7:00 am I&#39;m in the MoMa and face the criticism of the electricity price brake. Electricity must remain affordable in the future!
@pv_forum how do they work and what do they bring? Link?
"@pv_forum no I want to limit the exemptions. But 1.5 billion new additions are not a cardboard stick, and fewer and fewer payers due to self-consumption"
"@pv_forum Main problem: if 1.5 billion new buildings are built each year, EEG will increase by 6 or 7%. If the stock exchange stays the same. But it sinks. Well"
". @ UdoSieverding Yes, there is a need for political debate among many citizens. If we take it seriously, it is a great opportunity!"
@ Eject button I want to reduce the exceptions greatly. But at the moment the SPD is getting in the way
"@erhardrenz @richterpletten If you consume your PV electricity yourself, you save 8 cents per kWh, more and more do that"
"@frankbhv If you don&#39;t know me, you will definitely get to know me! But the energy transition is the central project for me"
"Thanks @uwbefern, at least try! :-)"
@marlenemortler that should give you something to think about. You probably have yourself
@pv_forum @richterpletten I haven&#39;t done anything yet: PB reform was coordinated with the solar industry
@pv_forum I don&#39;t do any so far. P
"@AxelKostrzewa the question of costs is not stupid but central: if you cause costs first and then complain about the prices, that&#39;s nasty"
@MHFFMNN that will change with the new feed-in tariff for handmade speeches!
@marlenemortler @jtretin only so that he can hatch something decent!
Bad news for opponents of the energy transition: Has just been nominated for the Bundestag again with 100% of the valid votes cast! Thank you!
", @JTrittin has lost his bearings: first he wants to completely eliminate industrial exemption (4 billion), then he says it&#39;s about frying companies"
@Duesenberg_ @gordongniewosz think so. But you should inquire at the CDU Trier if it is public. There is herring to eat

@Hobbbes Alaaf!
The Cologne Fastelovend in the Gürzenich - Rio is nothing against it! @ArminLaschet rocks the hall! The energy transition succeeds !!!
@JL_Manheim that always makes them tactical. :-)
@pv_forum The SPD is currently in the way: #kraft #oppermann #heikomaas
@orangesolar The expansion of PV continues at a rapid pace: so appreciate the. 4000 MW. But V. A. For your own consumption
"@SAARTEXT @heikomaas My suggestions benefit Saarland, because we pay a lot into the EEG surcharge and get little out"
Just read that SPD oppermann and Hannel. Want to keep the privileges of energy-intensive companies in full. Total turn
@powerphil @jtretin Subsidies for PV are now automatically reduced and will expire as soon as 52 gigawatts are reached
@ FrankyB122 thanks for the support
@CNjeunou I want to limit and reduce the exemptions
@paulxxm What&#39;s in there?
"@UlrichKelber Since I have been a minister, I have been in constant conversation with my experts, listen, read their papers and learn. Always more."
@erhardrenz @ulrichkelber was Do you think how big the uncertainty will be if the prices rise drastically in autumn
"@orangesolar @ulrichkelber why is the data wrong? So far, all other data was always wrong!"
"Now get me off the field. It was nice again, but I gave three talks to over 1000 people + discussion and now I&#39;m all !!!"
@UlrichKelber that is leprich and my experts only say that it doesn&#39;t fly
@UlrichKelber Are you still betting that the EEG surcharge will fall in autumn? Then you could agree to the electricity price protection
@PHoicke @gegisa Thank you for an intensive discussion!
"@GabiKostorz The @MKreutzfeldt has already been praised by me, even if I don&#39;t agree with everything."
"@GabiKostorz The @SPIEGELONLINE is very positive and tries to find a few hairs in the soup, which does not really work."
"@JottEs @KarstenHerre I didn&#39;t invent it, but what do you want to put in place?"
"@PHoicke @gegisa Sorry: But I was talking about the EEG surcharge, and he pays it in full !!! Your previous tweet twisted that!"
"@saarheini If you hadn&#39;t done that, you&#39;d be paying a lot more now (like many of your neighbors)"
@kpEschert Alaaf &amp; Helau! But be alarmed: I work despite the carnival! :-)
@GruegerS @pv_forum I don&#39;t understand: the electricity costs have exploded because the exchange prices are so low. Not because of me.
. @ RichterPletten Just because I want the energy transition to remain affordable? Would the supposed supporters want it to become priceless?
@StephanDaub Thanks! I&#39;m at home with the Bollen!
@PHoicke @gegisa Please do not say anything wrong: not a single golf club is exempt from the EEG surcharge. This is simply unsafe.
@KarstenHerre I ask you: The costs have been rising steeply for years and so far there is no single proposal that could prevent this
@littlesundevil I can&#39;t disagree with you. I would also like to talk more about good solutions. That is why securing electricity prices
@ zimmi69 They can&#39;t do it that quickly. You need a broad back in the job :-)
@PHoicke :-)
"@bockerl the more people discuss it, the better it is!"
"@gegisa @phoicke we therefore have to get to the subsidies, but with a sense of proportion!"
"@gegisa @phoicke 4 billion euros, that might be just enough to prevent an impending increase, but then many jobs would be threatened"
"@PHoicke you haven&#39;t said a word yet how high the costs are and who should bear them: always the electricity child, no matter how high?"
@PHoicke what do you suggest how to cover the costs?
@BabatundeOgboru @ haraldo1 he only comes because I had to develop the solution first: there are no other useful suggestions
@OekoChick No slogans: how far should the price of electricity rise?
"The question is whether the electricity customer should pay the bill alone, no matter how high it is. Or whether there are limits. @ haraldo1"
Even if I see things differently: @MKreutzfeldt knows how to write pointed comments!
@JungeUnionSB the JU SB city is a great group! Good luck in the new year

"Wherever I have been in Germany, people are keeping their fingers crossed for David McAllister because he is a super guy with no natural enemies"
"@TuSEnsdorf because many (including the SPD, Greens) delayed any EEG reform in the past and now complain about rising costs with tears from the alligator"
