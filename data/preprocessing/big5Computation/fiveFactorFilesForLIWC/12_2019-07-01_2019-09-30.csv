"Why arrogant? As I said, this is not about CL itself, but how we manage to decouple our free life from C02. A plea for technology and creative solutions instead of one for bans. TL"
May one. But why not look for opportunities that have the same effect on the climate but rely on innovation instead of bans? TL
"Creative example, but we are not interested in not having to do without at any cost, but in finding the most creative and cheapest way to save C02. Why don&#39;t we try that first and rely on technology and innovation instead of bans? TL"
"Wrong, we want to find a way to reconcile our free lifestyle with climate friendliness. This has nothing to do with skimming or waiting. We rely on technology as a solution: set the C02 limit and see how we can save it at the cheapest price. TL"
Why hopeless? We have to set a good example in Germany and find a way to combine economic progress and a free lifestyle with climate friendliness or climate neutrality - no one else in the world will follow us. TL
Thanks for the support! TL
"What exactly does this have to do with the AfD? That is exactly the problem with our debate culture. We advocate openness to technology and innovation in climate protection, which has absolutely nothing to do with populism, which you accuse us of. TL"
"No, we don&#39;t mean. We want to set a limit on C02 and then see where we can save it in the most creative and economical way. We do not have to wait for miracle technology for this, but should trust in the innovative strengths of the market. TL"
"Cycling is a great alternative, but it&#39;s no longer a real innovation, is it? ;) Also not always an alternative for rural commuters. When thinking about innovation in connection with mobility, we think of hydrogen or synthetic fuels. TL"
"Of course, we are committed to dealing with future generations. But why don&#39;t we focus on innovation and technology instead of doing without? We want to give C02 a limit and see how we can save it in the most creative and economical way. TL"
"Yes, but that&#39;s exactly why we say yes: we have to see how to combine free living with climate friendliness. However, we do not believe that this can only be achieved with bans, but instead rely on innovation and an expanded certificate trade. TL"

We&#39;ll keep trying anyway. We really want to create sustainable solutions that don&#39;t exclude anyone and still allow us to achieve the climate goals! TL
"For example, synthetic fuels have been around for a long time! Politics shouldn&#39;t get in the way! CL itself now drives a car powered by hydrogen. Because he does not want to do without and at the same time protect the climate. We make too little of existing innovations! TL"
"There are already many approaches, such as. synthetic fuels. The electricity grids have to be expanded so that the green electricity can also be transported away and European solutions for storage plants can be found. The storage facilities already exist, you just have to find agreements! TL"
"So you see for yourself that it is not possible for everyone to do without? Climate protection does not end at German borders, so we should rely on solutions that other countries can also follow. This will not be done without, but technology and research will. TL"
Please remain factual. TL

"That&#39;s what we demand: Introduce clever emissions trading with a secure CO2 limit using limited certificates (this can be done within 7 months) and at the same time massively advance research, for example on synthetic fuels and alternative drives. TL"
"No. It says: We have to introduce a clever emissions trading system with a safe CO2 limit using limited certificates (this can be done within 7 months) and at the same time massively advance research, for example on synthetic fuels and alternative drives. TL"
"The world would not follow us on a ban path. Instead: Introduce clever emissions trading with a secure CO2 limit using limited certificates (this can be done within 7 months) and at the same time promote research, for example on synthetic fuels."
"However, other countries will not follow this path of renunciation. We have to find international solutions and not just work with us with small-small. TL"
Other countries will not follow us on the waiver path. Because some of them have nothing to do without. That is why we have to achieve the goal of climate protection by means of innovation. TL
H√∂? That is exactly what he says here that one should use the innovative power of the economy! üí° TL
That was different üòâ TL
We are not waiting. We want to actively promote the technologies. TL
But that&#39;s not what it says ... TL
"No, he doesn&#39;t say that. He only suggests that the &quot;how&quot; should not be banned by politicians, but that we should focus on innovations. TL"
Where do you read this? The only question is what is the right way. TL
"No? Where do you read this? It&#39;s just about the way. The goal of climate protection, we agree on that. TL"
"To prevent this, we need innovations. TL"

"Dear Ms. Mariniƒá, my position is that of #Macron and also the #Bundesregierung: https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/1150708776728707072‚Ä¶. #Sea rescue CL"
We would also like to add that the request for disembarkation platforms / &quot;Safe Places&quot; in North Africa and the Sahel region is the official position of the # federal government (see master plan # migration) and has also been initiated by previous federal governments. TL
"Unfortunately, everything goes with us: Everyone who comes to Europe by sea is referred to as a # refugee. We have to face the truth that there are also untracked economic migrants who have no legal residence. &quot;"
Then it will also be possible to fairly distribute those seeking legal protection in Europe.
"Incidentally, this is a #AfD voter procurement program in circles of the #Bundespolizei, as I know from personal discussions. The key is to change Germany&#39;s #emigration policy - and reduce illegal migration."
"There is still no common # refugee policy in Europe. The disagreement goes back very strongly to #Germany, because the government has given the impression of an unlimited willingness to accept - and has so far made no rejection at the German borders."
"And we need a #sea rescue in state hands, which does not bring migrants to Europe, but first to the starting point of the respective trip. We must not make the #Tugger business easier."
The solution has to be that with the United Nations Refugee Agency in North Africa we are creating decent accommodation and legal escape routes to #Europe.
"&quot;It is a civilizational and legal obligation not to let people drown. Failure to provide assistance cannot be justified. On the other hand, there must be no aid to smuggling criminals among economic migrants."
Taxpayer day in June instead of July - and now we are accused of putting everything above the invisible hand of the market. Interesting. TL
Read Tweet correctly: Taxpayer day in June instead of July. TL
"Certain tasks - right. A deadline in July, by which the citizens only work for the state, is not necessary for this. TL"
What exactly is bothering you? TL
"Not one day, no. The cut-off date means that up to this day the year is completely (!) Worked for the state. So we say: a little less tax so that the cut-off date shifts from July to June would make sense. TL"
So members of the Bundestag must not criticize tax expenditure? Interesting ... TL
"These are not the party&#39;s debts, but the former parliamentary group. Since the new BTF is not the legal successor to the old one, it cannot stand up for it. It&#39;s a little more complicated than an article suggests. TL"

CL has always welcomed young people&#39;s commitment. For him it is very clear: Limiting global warming is a human task. The demonstrating young people have a legitimate concern when they point out the importance of effective climate protection. TL
It was just a #servicetweet from TL on the situation. TL
There is no political group position yet. Perhaps you would like to wait for a future update on the topic and start the weekend relaxed. üòâ TL

Do we. This morning we @fdpbt held a press conference in #Berlin and (again) promoted our emissions trading model. Have a look and give us a feedback: https://twitter.com/fdpbt/status/1146328009269551104‚Ä¶. TL

"That you accuse us of forming a judgment, even though we have never spoken to those affected, says a lot. In fact, we had these conversations. It is a pity that you deny us this without knowing us - and unnecessary. TL"
"We are committed to the social market economy, is very clear in our basic program (!). And: The problems for African farms, for example, have nothing to do with prosperity in Europe - but with the fact that Europe seals them off from prosperity through protectionism. TL"
In the Bundestag we have already made a request to the Federal Government to put pressure on the fight against the causes of flight. TL
Our MEPs in the European Parliament will work for this! TL
üòÇ The opposite is the case. The European Parliament wants more citizen participation! It is the government representatives who act in this way - denying them democratic legitimation is somehow not appropriate! TL
"Combating the causes of flight is a priority, of course! TL"
"I wish the EU more commitment in the areas of border control, # sea rescue and protection zones. CL (2/2)"
"You can&#39;t let people drown. At the same time, illegal economic migration cannot be approved. So there should be legal routes to Europe for qualified and those seeking protection - and protection zones in North Africa where everyone else can find security. (1/2)"
"Personal poker at #EUGipfel shows that we still have a lot to do when it comes to citizen participation. Instead of content, it is about personnel - now the losing candidate is to become President of the Commission. I haven&#39;t heard any arguments about the content. CL"
"In the event that the #Soli is actually only partially abolished, we will sue in #Karlsruhe because the constitution provides for the complete abolition by the end of 2020. TL"
We were also ... say &quot;very surprised&quot;. TL

"Thank you for your approval, we are happy! TL"
"Indeed, we stand up for it - and stand firmly against the image recently conveyed by @spdbt that mobile work would be lazy. üë®‚Äçüíª TL"

Which of our positions do you not like? TL
"Thank you, we&#39;re happy! TL"
"Please don&#39;t forget self-employed people either. The fact is: the bottom line is that a considerable part of the working middle class must continue to pay the #Soli, although relief would be urgently needed here. But the @spdbt suggests that the issue is ineffective income. TL"

Good thing that the #Education Monitor shows a comparison of the countries. But the crucial question is where we stand internationally. And none of the 16 countries can compete there. Time for a basic #education reform! CL

"In classes with many children without knowledge of German there are problems in everyday life. #Linnemann has the wrong solution. Instead of doing without #enrollment, separate preparatory classes should be set up, which initially only support #German. CL"
"Almost half of the Bundeswehr pilots are too rarely in the air. @akk needs to improve. Because if other pilots quit, the #Bundeswehr will be left behind even more in international comparison. CL"
We can definitely confirm that - with Team Lindner a Nutella ban is impossible anyway üòâ TL
Have fun on the #CSDHamburg. Show everyone how much fun diversity is! #hamburgpride
There is never absolute security (under liberal conditions). But yes: more police personnel strengthen security. TL
We can deny that at this point. üòâ TL
"Now you have to explain that to us, at which point we would defend ourselves &quot;with all our might against technical progress&quot; ... TL"
Could it be that you have not yet looked at our positions and initiatives and are therefore quick to judge? You can find them here and we look forward to your feedback: https://www.fdpbt.de/fraktion/initektiven‚Ä¶. TL
Thank you for the refreshing #ff! TL
"Then we will do it this way: We will inform you closely (including here) about what we are doing. And if you finally (again) decide to have a cross with us, we look forward to it! TL"
"We know that by aborting the explorations at the time, we also created opponents. Nevertheless, the decision remains correct and has nothing to do with &quot;crouching away&quot;. TL"
Every day. Promised. TL
We see it that way. TL
"One shouldn&#39;t rule out the other. Here, by the way, we make specific suggestions for improving the education system for everyone (whether wealthy or socially weak): http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/070/1907031.pdf‚Ä¶. TL"
The one does not exclude the other. Of course we are also for higher investments in education. TL
Exactly - you can find the podcast on several relevant platforms. We are looking forward to your feedback! TL
Our speech ... TL
Thank you for your suggestions! What do the proponents say? TL
We are pleased that you are taking the opportunity to hear several episodes. We wish you save travels! TL
"Ministry employees still fly back and forth between #Bonn and #Berlin. In 2019, the location should no longer be a challenge. Video conferences and online tools make moving unnecessary. When will the #digitalization be lived in Bonn and Berlin? CL"
"The trip to #Hongkong was a matter close to my heart. We not only pursue economic interests, we are equally concerned with liberal and democratic values. It is therefore difficult to prescribe travel routes and discussion partners seriously. CL https://twitter.com/SeverinWeiland/status/1153329934259105793‚Ä¶"
"Thank you for your approval, we are happy! TL"
"Thank you, we&#39;re happy! TL"
That is not right. Our parliamentary group has not yet taken a decision on the #banning ban. TL
Thank you for your approval! TL
"Thank you very much, we are happy! TL"
Thanks for the hint! You may also be interested in the #Bahn matter that we recently submitted an application to the #Bundestag demanding higher compensation for delays: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/099/1909927.pdf .... TL
Only 20 minutes were planned for the interview - specifically you can find our initiatives here: https://www.fdpbt.de/fraktion/initektiven‚Ä¶. Feedback very welcome! TL
What @Johnny_Mauser says. TL
The interview is available online here. Feel free to take a look and get your own picture instead of just relying on #Twitter. üòâ TL
"We find the comparison amusing üòÇ But seriously: Yes, opposition means controlling the government instead of governing yourself. We made a conscious decision to do so because #Jamaika did not have sufficient common ground. TL"
What do you mean by &quot;untapped potential&quot;? Do you think that we are under-covering these issues? TL
We are against a CO2 tax. TL
"At that time, we did not enter into coalition negotiations because there was no common ground with black and green. This was our prerequisite - so it didn&#39;t work out last time. TL"
Honestly: How do you fix that? TL
Thank you and all the best to you! TL
"At that time, all the parties leaned back too much, yes, that was a mistake. Doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t do better now. TL"
Exactly. We always mark this so that our followers always know exactly who they are writing with. TL
"Right, they have to be created. TL"

Anyone who is persecuted should of course continue to come as a # refugee without a visa. That is completely out of the question. TL
But: https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/1150708776728707072‚Ä¶. TL
Do you stick to your hard words after reading what was really said? https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/1150708776728707072‚Ä¶ TL
Are you already at work today? üòâ TL
"Moin Mr. Isler, this is about positions that are also represented by Macron and the Federal Government. It goes without saying that such measures must be in line with the Geneva Refugee Convention. TL"
"The part in quotes is definitely straight from him. At #Twitter, we want to offer good service and respond quickly, and that&#39;s best done as a team. TL"
We rely on #teamwork for both. üòÄ TL
"In this case, the @c_lindner social media team, abbreviated: TL. TL"
"&quot;These proposals&quot; were made both by the federal government, as well as by previous federal governments, and by Macron and were widely discussed at EU level. All laypersons for you? TL"
Thank you! TL
Where did &quot;Herr Lindner&quot; say that? Are looking forward to the source ... üòâ TL
Thanks for your approval! TL
"@Faznet quoted @c_lindner at the weekend about #Seeno rescue. For the sake of completeness, his entire statement to the FAZ, which contains the answers to some questions &amp; comments here at #Twitter: #thread. üëá"
Reading the linked content helps - but of course we still accept the criticism. TL
"He didn&#39;t talk about Libya, but about Africa - and about the UNHCR. TL"
It is necessary to set up reception centers in cooperation with @UNHCR_de and @IOMGermany in #North Africa and the Sahel region. TL
"I did not speak of #Libyen, but of #Africa - and of @UNHCR_de. CL"
"Dear @ARegenauer, this is not a new proposal, but has long been one of the # federal government (see p. 8 in the migration master plan, keyword &quot;safe places&quot; or disembarkation platforms): https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs /downloads/DE/veroeffst√§ndigungen/themen/migration/masterplan-migration.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=7‚Ä¶.

"We are happy to answer, what was your question? TL"
@Listentojasper is right there. TL
"If such comments are your style, go ahead. That would not be ours. TL"
Thank you! TL
So should Members of the Bundestag no longer advocate relief for citizens? Interesting. TL
"No, this is about relief. If the deadline by which the citizens only worked for the state were in June instead of July, the things you mentioned would still be secured. TL"
"As a member of the Bundestag, can you no longer campaign for the relief of citizens? Interesting. TL"
"Is this your way of leading a political discourse? An insult? So our style is not. If you still want to make an argument, you are cordially invited. TL"
üòÑ Thanks for #ff. TL
Thanks for the positive feedback! üòÄ TL
That is exactly the goal of our podcast # 1Thema2Farben - discussing different party colors. We are pleased that you like the episode! TL
Thank you - we are very happy about the positive feedback üòÄ TL
Thank you very much for the postive feedback! We&#39;re pleased. TL
"Right. Nevertheless, only the situation was explained here. TL"
Thank you very much for the postive feedback! üòÄ More? We already had some exciting guests at # 1Thema2Farben - we&#39;d love to have a look. And if you have any suggestions for whom we should invite: just bring it on. TL
We also find üòÄ TL
We would also like to raise doubts ... üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ TL

Good things take time ... ;-) TL
Thank you! üòÄ TL
Researchers from Zurich prove that #Climate change can be combated most effectively by afforestation. Global efforts to increase forest cover would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. A good proposal from science that requires quick action. CL
We generally do not scold political competitors - we argue with them about better political concepts. TL
Just about this question - &quot;Do we need fear on the climate issue?&quot; - we spoke to Greta&#39;s German colleague. You might want to listen: https://twitter.com/fdpbt/status/1148980268822405127‚Ä¶. TL
Thanks for your approval! TL
Already done. üòÄ Have fun listening! TL
Have fun üòÄ And we look forward to your feedback! TL
"Thanks for the approval! Umgekehrt Conversely, we were happy that @Luisamneubauer was open to the discourse. We have also had other experiences. Enjoy listening. TL"

"Walter #Scheel was born 100 years ago today. A great liberal, politician and statesman. As party chairman, first development minister, foreign minister and vice chancellor as well as federal president, Scheel has shaped our country significantly and remains unforgettable. CL"
"We are ready to work on a #climate consensus. With the expansion of #emission trading, we have brought an effective and efficient instrument into the debate.

Why announced a week ago? Not true at all. Only reported shooting. Come next week. TL

Factual information must not be punishable! So it&#39;s good news that the verdict against doctor Kristina # H√§nel has been overturned. The legislator is required: # 219a has to be completely gone so that we don&#39;t have to face such judgments again and again ... CL
We are skeptical of #VonderLeyen. Not only because of @BMVg_Bundeswehr. The best would be @vestager. #Merkel also prevented her because she wasn&#39;t a top candidate ... She was on the top team and Commissioner! @bmvonderleyen is now the rabbit out of the top hat. CL
"But on the contrary. Our concept of emissions trading guarantees that the climate goals of the Paris Agreement will be achieved. We just explained the concept again today in a press conference in #Berlin, here it is recorded: https://twitter.com/fdpbt/status/1146328009269551104‚Ä¶. TL"
Thank God! üòâ TL
The guests of our podcast receive no fee. TL
"This current episode is not yet online, but we hope you went to work today anyway ;-) TL"
We&#39;re pleased! TL
"It is our podcast # 1Topic2Colors, which you can find on all relevant # podcast platforms (and @YouTube). The episode with @Luisamneubauer will be online shortly. TL"
Why didn&#39;t you think that? TL
"Thanks a lot! #SocialMedia is important to us. CL does not do this alone, but has a team (TL) to support him. The tweets are always marked accordingly so that you can see who wrote / replied. TL"
"You can find it on the relevant platforms, including Spotify, Apple, YouTube, ... just search for # 1Thema2 colors. There have been many exciting discussions! TL"
Thanks a lot! üòÄ TL
"Then you just don&#39;t listen, not that your prejudices are not confirmed ü§≠ TL"
What they&#39;re saying is just wrong. Talk to people who work in Africa in the agricultural sector. They want an opportunity for fair market access - more liberalism instead of foreclosure of the European market and flooding with subsidized EU products. TL
"Who actually ran into your liver? We are looking for conversation and discourse here and you mob around here all the time. If you find everything stupid, then don&#39;t work yourself off on us! TL"

"Team Lindner. We always make it clear whether CL itself or its team is writing, so that this is as transparent as possible for the readers. TL"
Exactly the differentiation is made in the tweet? TL
"Firstly, we are not committed to the free market economy, but to the social market economy - and secondly, the free or social market economy is not the same as open borders. Please differentiate, otherwise no discourse is possible. TL"
"Of course we are also looking for cooperation. But inquiry is an important instrument in parliament - it is accompanied, among other things, by press attention and puts pressure on the government. Is more important than private discussions with MdBs, which we are of course also looking for. TL"
"Of course, we cannot leave the riparian states alone - that would be cynical. TL"
"It&#39;s not about building slums, it&#39;s about building proper protection zones! That requires a lot of commitment, yes, but it must be worth the safety of the people! TL"
You can find all of this in the tweet. How exactly do you disagree? Where is this tweet supposed to be inhumane? TL
What specifically bothered you about the tweet? How would you do it differently? TL
Qualified AND protection seekers. Where&#39;s that a problem now? Why is it no longer allowed to talk about qualified immigration? TL
"Therefore yes: The EU must make a decisive commitment to rescue at sea, as stated in the tweet (and also in the second tweet). TL"
You have to decide: is that not an attitude or the wrong attitude (but then an attitude)? What is inhumane about the statement? It&#39;s the opposite. TL
The free market economy is an economic order. This is something completely different. TL
"Yes, seriously. What is it that bugs you about the statement? TL"
It&#39;s a shame that you see it that way. What would you specifically criticize? :) TL
"Free lifestyle for those who cannot afford to do without because they have to drive to work in the country, for example. The CO2 tax would seep away in the household. The certificate trade can go to research and projects for a specific purpose. TL"
With &quot;I want to please&quot; you unfortunately don&#39;t get very far in the current discussion. And we don&#39;t have time for that either. We have to act now. TL
"There are people who cannot afford certain restrictions. Because they lack the resources or because they live in the country, for example, and at 4:30 a.m. there is still no bus that can take them to work. This has nothing to do with &quot;selfishness&quot;. TL"
Our opinions don&#39;t differ that much. The ‚Ç¨ 10 / t CO2 set by GroKo is currently already below the traded certificate price. But thanks for your honest feedback! TL
"As we are limited here in terms of drawing technology: hydrogen drives, storage of energy (e.g. through cooperation with storage facilities within) EU, synthetic fuels, storage of CO2, afforestation programs. More at http://fdpbt.de :) TL"

"To stagger the amount of CO2 with certificate trading that we still have. There are significantly fewer certificates every year, so CO2 must be saved. At the same time, the money flows through a dedicated fund into research. So we control from 2 points against :) TL"
Absolute approval! TL
What was misleading about it? If you understood it you would not react that way. üòä TL
"Naturally! If you want to limit yourself, you are very welcome! We only want to find sustainable solutions because there are people who unfortunately cannot afford to do without. But, we are still completely with you! :) TL"
"The market? No, a failed planned economy brought us into this situation. With the right framework and emissions trading, the market offers the solution to the current problem. TL"
"Our opinions don&#39;t differ that much! :) This is how effective certificate trading works, as we demand it! Thanks for the graph :) TL"
