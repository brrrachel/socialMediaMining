Next week in # UA1BT it should be interesting again. Then we hear under 3. the source leader of the police VP01 from NRW. This was close to the later assassin and reported on his attack plans. @pod_ua #BreitscheidplatzAnschlag pic.twitter.com/XtiK1yZmpv

A central question is when and how the US secret service came into possession of the # Amri confession videos from the end of November 2016 and when it shared them with German and European partner services. # UA1BT https://twitter.com/FlorianFlade/status/1184879283929600002‚Ä¶
"Contrary to the clear denial of a possible source property of Stephan Ernst by the federal government in the interior committee, the question about Markus Hartmann is strangely covered. # L√ºbcke #Rechtsterror #Verfassungsschutz Abschaffen https://twitter.com/mstnhgn/status/1185071283115122688‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/sIF7i6r0W7"

And was Andreas Temme (formerly LfV Hessen) also responsible for the alleged terrorist supporter Markus Hartmann? # L√ºbcke #Rechtsterror @mstnhgn https://twitter.com/mstnhgn/status/1184849744448970752‚Ä¶
My colleague @michel_brandt_ will be visiting my constituency on Monday. Together we want to talk about Europe&#39;s inhumane foreclosure policy. I look forward to numerous guests at our event on Monday from 6 p.m. in @monamiWeimar. #refugeeswelcome # pier pic.twitter.com/pyy6wWvAfJ
I NEVER want to hear about anti-Semitic or racist attacks and assassinations by &quot;frustrated individuals&quot;. #Seehofer # hal0910
I am the spokeswoman for the @Left faction for &quot;anti-fascist politics&quot; The badge of the &#39;anti-fascist action&#39; is a matter of course for me. The AfD felt provoked. Kubicki legitimized their screaming with the call to order. https://taz.de/Debatte-um-Antifa-Sticker-im-Bundestag/!5629657/‚Ä¶
I don&#39;t confuse staging with ideology. http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/026/1902649.pdf‚Ä¶
"After the Prepper scene, the gamers scene is now to blame - well, I&#39;m reassured. I already thought they were Nazis. # hal0910"
&quot;Blocking notes&quot; now mean &quot;disclosure / usage requirements&quot; mean the same thing: Relevant information about the assassin must not be used to investigate the attack. Salami tactics from #BReg continue. Question of time until another video appears. # UA1BT pic.twitter.com/GLYokuFkU4
"On November 19, at the invitation of the Literary Colloquium and @Jungle_World, I can talk to Volker Wei√ü about Adorno&#39;s &quot;Aspects of New Right-Wing Radicalism&quot;. https://www.facebook.com/events/410013209715607/?ti=icl‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/slO04EcDMd"
"How often do you want to tweet this ****** article? No, the eyeliners are not to blame for sexism and anti-feminism."
"Right-wing terrorism cannot be dealt with in security policy alone. This danger must also be addressed politically. That means: it&#39;s not about extremism, it&#39;s about anti-Semitism and racism. The Halle attack is part of the shift to the right in society. # hal0910"
"I extend my sympathy to the relatives of the victims, the members of the Jewish community in Halle, the injured and employees and guests of the snack bar, which was also affected by the attack. # hal0910 #Antisemitism"
"And there he is again. If #Right Terror is in the room, it can only have been a single offender for authorities and prevailing security policy. It also contributes to the disinformation that she is called ‚Äúamok‚Äù. # hal0910 https://twitter.com/MatthiasMeisner/status/1181976557990158337‚Ä¶"

2/2 And the # UA1BT must find out when and how exactly the USA secret service got hold of the videos and who was informed about them here and at what time in other European countries.
"Why is the debate about more # Amri confession videos going so wrong? It is not a question of whether the videos were mentioned in the files in # UA1BT, but rather that they are not available to BAO City for the investigation. 1/2 https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/aufregung-ueber-neues-amri-video-16417009.html‚Ä¶"
"&quot;Often just illegal pyrotechnics&quot; I don&#39;t go with it. It is worth remembering the attacks by the &quot;Freital Group&quot;, here too pyrotechnics were the basis. In the judgment, the attacks with this explosive were clearly rated as &quot;attempted murder&quot; # right terror. https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/neonazi-sprengstoff-fund-101.html‚Ä¶"
"When it comes to clearing up this terrorist attack, an intelligence agency has to deliver. It should not be a state secret to what extent there were accomplices &amp; backers. #BND is a federal agency. And is not outside the rule of law and its mandate to atone for crimes. https://twitter.com/SZ/status/1179655822537822208‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/t8mCo9IXGh"

Two roll-call votes - take your time.
In plain language this means: LKA NRW accuses #BKA and #BMI of boycotting investigations against the IS preacher Abu Walaa and his cell and thus also against #Amri. # UA1BT https://twitter.com/MartinaRenner/status/1195015500390117381‚Ä¶
"Witness (head of EK Ventum) testifies that the order from top BKA (Sven Kurenbach) and then interior minister came to silence the VP01. It should be &quot;broken down&quot;. Incredible statements in # UA1BT. For a long time, the VP provided the most reliable information about #Amri."
Thank you for your stance on #AllMalePanels. Let&#39;s argue that @linksfraktion no longer organizes men&#39;s panels: https://www.linksfraktion.de/termine/detail/die-transformation-politisch-gestalten/‚Ä¶
"Yes, the contact point will be retained and the leader will continue to sit on the parliamentary board in the future."
"A good start to the day. Look over to the Legal Affairs Committee, which has just voted out the racist and anti-Semite #Brandner as chairman with 37 votes in favor. #NoAfD pic.twitter.com/aEwTYuEInb"
2/2 A new start after two difficult years looks different. The poor election results for the top of the parliamentary group speak volumes. The chairman of the parliamentary group #KeinWeiterSo is now to be understood not as a phrase but as a practice. Power politics must end.
"The @Left faction will have to go into a second round in the elections to the board. The head of AK Foreign Policy, the second deputy next to @CarenLay and the coordinator in the contact point for social movements are open. 1/2 https://www.linksfraktion.de/fraktion/konto/‚Ä¶"
