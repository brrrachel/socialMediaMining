The fact is that the line between democratic parties and right-wing extremist agitators has to be drawn much more consistently. We must not get used to creeping border violations! The right spirit of the democratic enemies must be combated by all peaceful means!

The fire speeches are followed by incendiary devices and open threats of murder must not be trivialized as just admissible criticism of abuse.

Tonight at 11.30 p.m. on ZDF on &quot;Markus Lanz&quot;.
Mr. Kurz was voted out of office in the Austrian parliament. In the upcoming election campaign he will probably try to give the impression that he doesn&#39;t know his radical right-wing and presumably corrupt ex-coalition partner around Strache &amp; Co. at all.
"Now of all things, putting freedom of expression online on the disposition is quite a crazy idea by @akk in response to the election results. More consistency in climate protection and a good climate protection law at the federal level would be a much better answer."
"We had agreed in the party executive board to discuss the necessary strategic political course quickly and not to put personnel squabbles in the foreground. After a challenge from the parliamentary group, Andrea Nahles rightly ensures a quick decision."
"The rise of the ‚ÄúIron‚Äù from Union Berlin to the Bundesliga is a little surprise. The second division will be exciting next season with Hannover 96, 1.FC Nuremberg, VfB Stuttgart, HSV, Holstein Kiel and St.Pauli."
In the afternoon there was a press briefing about the group meeting and an internship week for colleagues from the group in the catering trade.

"Bitter forecasts for SPD in European elections + Bremen elections. Despite a committed election campaign, we clearly missed our election goals. Even if a red-green-red government is possible in Bremen, the turning point remains for the first time nationwide behind the Greens."

"President Haldenwang criticizes the gray area between bourgeois forms of protest and right-wing radicalism. Unlike his predecessor, the unfortunate legal interpreter Maassen, who is now leading the CDU rights, he considers street applause for &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; - calls are not normal."
"In the co-agreement, the SPD enforced the overdue minimum training allowance for trainees. In contrast, employer lobby, CDU economic wing and also the FDP economy minister from SH Sturm run. With crocodile tears they cry the tariff autonomy for which they do nothing else."
"This is absurd, level and against any fairness! We are talking about women who have worked for decades, paid contributions, been poorly paid, raised children or cared for relatives and should get more than basic security! https://twitter.com/HugoMuellerVogg/status/1127804139193368576‚Ä¶"
Campaign by Mr. Ziemiak and the JU chairman Kuban against the basic pension (which is in the coalition agreement) is disrespectful. Especially if you demand solos for the wealthy at the same time (not in the Koa contract). Respectant instead of tax gifts for the super rich!
"Pension is not a social benefit based on cash, but a return on life&#39;s benefit. Basic pension (&quot;pension&quot;) ensures that those (mostly women) who have worked for decades at low wages, raised children or cared for relatives have more than basic security."
@katarinabarley rightly suggests that there must be sanctions if the rental brake is not met.

Personnel quarrels and no end Zoff in the state parliament of Kiel http://www.ln-online.de/Nachrichten/Norddeutschland/Personalquerelen-und-kein-Ende-Zoff-im-Kieler-Landtag‚Ä¶
"Barack Obama in Germany. What a President? What a contrast to the current incumbent in the White House. Even Obama&#39;s predecessor, Bush Jr., was a good president compared to this chubby, notoriously truth-fearing boast."
"An expert opinion was published in a well-known trade journal - after that, personnel decisions at the head of the state administration in Schleswig-Holstein could be presumed to be illegal"
"The Saarland AFD asked the most common names of convicted knife attackers: Answer: Michael, Daniel, Andreas, Sascha, Thomas, Christian, Kevin, Manuel, Patrick, David, Jens, Justin, Sven. The obvious strength of the Islamists in Saarland is terrifying. üòÇ"
"The Saturday newspaper devotes a whole page to the challenging circumstances of the political profession. Well described - but no comparison, with what hundreds of thousands of people, under very thin pay, can do in nursing professions, in chords, as educators, as couriers, etc"
This will be an exciting weekend for athletes. The Kiel storks receive FC St.Pauli with a new grandstand in the north derby. Tonight everyone is watching the top game in the first division between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The final four is coming up for handball.
Market walk before breakfast in nice spring weather. Easter holidays have already started in the north.

"Will the second BREXIT referendum still take place in Great Britain ?! I would hope so. People&#39;s ingenuity is inexhaustible, right? ü§î"
"Large majority in the Bundestag against the election of a vice president from among the ranks of nationalists, racists, right-wing radicals and enemies of democracy. That is a good thing and the whine of right-wing populists about allegedly undemocratic treatment (= free, secret choice) is ridiculous! üòÇ"
Well attended event of the SPD parliamentary group with Franz M√ºntefering in Kiel yesterday evening. Under the title &quot;How do we want to live in old age?&quot; There was an interesting discussion with humorous and also very thoughtful aspects and a brilliant guest speaker.

"The political pressure for massive rearmament in Europe is wrong. We need a (also in terms of foreign policy) jointly acting social Europe that invests in work, education, the environment, the future and (also social) infrastructure and none that participates in the arms race!"
"With all understanding for electoral law reforms that should avoid oversized parliaments. If this only benefits one party (Union), falsifies the will of the voters or weakens the representation in the area, it is better to stay away from it."
"Democrats have to elect right-wing radicals as deputy presidents of parliament? Absurd. You don&#39;t have to (!) Choose anyone, otherwise that would mean notarial confirmation - not a choice. In the AFD are nationalists, European enemies, racists, right-wing radicals. You don&#39;t choose such types!"

"For the umpteenth time, the Monday newspaper caricatures my position on affordable housing. The e-word seems to be the desired Beelzebub for the conservatives and market radicals and is particularly good in Holy Week üòÇ"
"In Finland, the Socialists narrowly won the elections. Positive signal!"
The HSV competes with the leader in Cologne today. Any point would be a win in the promotion race.
