Why are these three reasons? It is related. Merry Christmas! CL
I recommend the wording of the interview compared to the summary. At the moment there is a lot of interpretation in Berlin-Mitte ... CL https://twitter.com/faznet/status/944612315995037696‚Ä¶
"Apart from the hard interpretation of the FAS: where is the contradiction? My statement has nothing to do with 2009-2013. You judge in ignorance of the wording, don&#39;t you? CL"
"Well, we simply could not find these &quot;new impulses&quot; in the exploratory papers ...;) You are right with the weeks of probing. I wouldn&#39;t do that a second time. CL"
"The Greens didn&#39;t want to turn black and green in 2013, but they did talk about Jamaica in 2017. In your eyes, was that behaviorally creative or was it okay? ;)"
"No, that is not correct. First, I didn&#39;t whistle anyone back. Secondly, Wolfgang Kubicki was interpreted (incorrectly) as if it were about this legislative period. We have a clear and unequivocal decision. CL"
Such nonsense. I replied to a question almost the same way as in previous weeks. Compare our Bureau decision of December 5th. I can only wonder about the excitement ... CL
"When asked by @wiwo, I represent #Jamaika almost the same position, which I have been voicing for weeks and which we approved in a unanimous decision of the Presidium on December 5th. have fixed. And yet the Newsvalue has ... You are surprised. CL"
"No, WK had been assumed that he was concerned with this parliamentary term. Our position is: You don&#39;t have to rule it out forever, but in this political (electoral program) and personal constellation it doesn&#39;t work. CL"
"So how do you do it right when asked? You answer with the known position, right? And that is unchanged ... CL"
"This parliamentary term makes no sense, but the Free Democrats would not refuse to talk if a changed political and personnel constellation promised more success than in 2017. CL https://twitter.com/welt/status/943781386703593472‚Ä¶"
"Again the liberal Commissioner @vestager, who is serious about global tax justice ... CL #ikea https://twitter.com/vestager/status/942724226456457216‚Ä¶"
"By the way, your profile is cool: &quot;benevolent understanding of the other&quot; ;-)"
"Nonsense - that&#39;s a twist on my position. I advise differentiated solutions. There are common rules and values in the EU, but there is also room for self-determination. Germany shouldn&#39;t be too arrogant. CL"
Contradictory election programs will not evaporate. #Jamaica is no longer an issue for anyone in this parliamentary term. Wolfgang was probably misinterpreted. We would support minority government constructively. Union does not have to be blackmailed by the SPD. CL https://twitter.com/focusonline/status/938008320581005312‚Ä¶
"If you want to do politics with surveys, take this current survey: https://www.google.de/amp/s/www.cicero.de/innenpolitik/cicero-umfrage-mehrheit- Gegen-familiennachzug%3famp‚Ä¶ CL"
"Firstly, this survey is old and secondly, the respondents probably did not know the number of cases. CL"
"As is well known, the BMI sees the digital pact differently - no legal basis ... CL"
It&#39;s a shame that MP #Kretschmann refuses to think again in education. He is also opposed to the Greens&#39; election program ... CL #jamaika #kooperationsverbot # f√∂deralismus https://twitter.com/jungerkollege/status/930411102789341184‚Ä¶
No - that doesn&#39;t work: see EU. Who is looking at that? But it doesn&#39;t do much harm except for the unnecessary bureaucracy. So that would be no reason for ideological resistance for us. CL
The @fdp continues to reject the #NetzDG and could only belong to a government that abolishes it or changes its character fundamentally. CL
You recently shared comments that the FDP is not willing to compromise. It&#39;s probably just about your business. üòÇ CL
"No other, but an added one: namely that transfer and liability union, euro zone budget, etc. are still excluded. This is more politically significant because we would be needed for it. Conversely, if the ESM were to pull back, the FDP would need a majority in others. CL"
"Unfortunately, I am abbreviated here when it comes to euro policy. Long version see FB: http://www.facebook.com/lindner.christian/posts/1916266865054541‚Ä¶ CL https://twitter.com/derspiegel/status/928947622345302016‚Ä¶"

"Exchange with French Minister #LeMaire: on tax justice + investment in new technology consensus, at #Euro exciting exchange.TL pic.twitter.com/XBUd1mZSaz"
"Note that like the Greens, you&#39;d rather import dirty lignite power from Poland for a clear conscience. üòÇ CL"
"Hmmm. If I see it correctly, nobody denies the problem of a secured capacity gap in the 20s ... CL"
Then we immediately agree. Then all you have to do is calculate what could be omitted in the dark 2023 without import. And? CL
Then the Greens would only have to explain quickly how to do it without import during dark periods like on Friday at 5:00 p.m. üëç CL
You argue based on annual production. Check out the last Friday between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. What do you see CL

On the subject of # coal exit from @Die_Gruenen - here is the actual electricity production in Germany today at 5:00 p.m. CL pic.twitter.com/3aE4FkiFEj
"No, but we don&#39;t fear voters either. CL"
Not at all. &quot;To listen&quot; is there. And the physical nonexistence in negotiations is an undisputable fact. CL
In the long run - yes ... but in the short term this leads to the import of coal electricity from Poland and nuclear energy from France. Is it good? CL
"Your tweet sounds kind of biased. ;-) If a party knows and avoids H√§me, then probably the FDP ... CL"
No. Mr. Kapferer is not even involved in the negotiations. CL
@Fdp has made this clear long ago. Has no negotiating mandate from our party. TL
Kapferer will participate at the express suggestion of Merkel and upon invitation by Altmaier. TL
"Kapferer is a member of the FDP, but he has no negotiating mandate for our party. @Fdp has also clarified this. TL"
"As a service, I shared the Greens&#39; transparency tweets! CL"
Just tell people the numbers - and then the survey will be repeated. How do EU partners deal with this question? CL
"We like to take responsibility. But we have principles. Just as Greens denounced us in the election campaign, you have different people than we do. CL"
I don&#39;t think you would have criticized that in the event of a statement by the party leadership ... and there is no exit or receipt so far. CL
"... but if the Greens move us near Trump in the past few days, don&#39;t you write anything? Praise for objectivity! üòÇ CL"
