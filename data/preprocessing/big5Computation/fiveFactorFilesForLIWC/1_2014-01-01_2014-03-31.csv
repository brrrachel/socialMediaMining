@flueke @BoehningB ... dance the mice :-)
@BoehningB With me.
In the middle of Europe. Incomprehensible. #euromaidan
@UdoSieverding actually broke the 1000 follower limit and nobody said anything! Congratulation!
@netzwege I ate the piss! :-)
Tonight I have to give up my title as King of Kale from Oldenburg. Hereditary monarchy is somehow better! ...
@ TheBug0815 I could only come to the annual reception briefly or not at all. What should I do?
@ SL1981 what does that have to do with the correct use of Twitter?
@ SL1981 @fraeulein_tessa @groehe @peersteinbrueck This is probably because we don&#39;t have as many followers as you! :-)
@ Koschda77 I&#39;m not at all sure that GM corn is so much more harmful than natural corn sprayed with tons of insecticides
@Timon_Gremmels and? Did he get there? ... of course not the jacket but the minister to the branch ...
"@MKreutzfeldt If it causes us to pile up new mountains of debt before we even paid back 1 billion, it&#39;s a problem!"
"@DasGuteessen @MKreutzfeldt Fas, however, I have already behind me for today. ! :-))"
@MKreutzfeldt What is positive about it?
@KlausRiede Klar - as ChefBK I know (almost) everything!
@FredUndErik You shouldn&#39;t underestimate me holding! :-)
@FredUndErik @ARDde @ZDF @FAZ_Topnews @SZ @OfficialTAZ @SPIEGELONLINE @FOCUS_TopNews :-)
"@ monikatrache country u people are fine. We implement our election program: mother&#39;s pension, no new debts from 2015, no tax increases!"
@BennyWhber It was not a ranking order. :-)
@ GrumpyPeer1 I suspected that it would eventually come out: all because of the new mass detectors. :-)
"@fr_schirrmacher No, not clear: the network is as neutral as a rifle: it can be used for attack and defense. 1.2"
@reticuleena :-))
"@anked Not at all, but at least the Left Party and the Green Party didn&#39;t trust them either."
"@NaneKratzke The election is the most important one (no election without democracy), but election is every 4 years and Twitter is permanent! :-)"
"@smegworx @SolidarBlog After all, &quot;the citizens&quot; voted for #Groko with over 66% of the valid votes cast! :-)"
"@woksoll If you were right about the energy transition, everything should be much better now ..."
Twitter is the sharpest weapon of democracy today: we just haven&#39;t noticed it yet!
"@DavidKerkenhoff Huh? The Chancellery forbids nothing, especially not to his boss! :-)"
"@MKreutzfeldt uses the possibilities u what it brings. Then you will see. My AL was skeptical at the time, but it was the wish on site."
@MKreutzfeldt Back then we did what was requested and what was legally permissible and possible. Now the wearer must explain how he 1/2
@alexzeyer @NadineSchoen @StormAndreas @ SteffenMeyer73 I had overlooked it! Greetings back! The work continues!
@MKreutzfeldt I see no contradiction: I had promised Asse&#39;s law and delivered with the consent of everyone. Now it&#39;s about implementation.
@MGrosseBroemer @petertauber thank god who the pizza is not black green :-)
@ringbug when I&#39;m rested it works :-)
"@MiKellner Huch, almost forgot to congratulate you on your new position! Make it happen!"
@sarfeld @petertauber And then also the &quot;filled&quot; - Saarland specialty with liver sausage from &quot;You may&quot;! :-)
"@Golwar Honestly not: if there is copyright protection for photos, then this must also apply if the photo comes from a film."
@petertauber :-))
@HenningKrumrey 1) is not yet certain. 2) rarely existed before 3) how do you want to know? :-))
@KonstantinNotz :-))
3) European elections with top candidates for the first time 4) Overcoming the euro crisis through genuine reforms 5) Appropriate consequences from NSAs worldwide
Things that change the country: 1) No new debts from 2015 2) Black-green in Hesse with mutual respect at eye level 1/3
@ ChrisTanzi91 Everything Thuringia or what? :-))
"@Jeky will be cleared on Monday, am now in Erfurt and have no access"
@wupperpoet But it was of no use! The competence for a good affordable energy transition lies with us and not with @JTrittin #Wahlresult
@Jeky what email then?
@HH_Rick :-)
"@HH_Rick So it is! That is also OK. As many postcards, emails, tweets as desired, but no blockages please!"
"@HH_Rick Thanks! Unfortunately, as Minister of the Environment, I wasn&#39;t allowed to do that and it was the weekend. Find account blockades as wrong as seat blocks"
"@bitproIT @saschalobo Well, what can I say ...? :-)"
"@TiloJung If you want to know it exactly: it is never about a (network) party or a (grand) coalition, but always about country and people!"
"@Smohly By feeling: For example, you are now served quite well with 3 answers! :-) There are also many, unfortunately I don&#39;t have time."
"Ntv “@timokather: at #duell, @saschalobo and @peteraltmaier are debating the future of the internet today.”"
@tri_tra_trulala :-)
@Smohly that also depends on my own activities: between 10 and 200.
@tommys_diary sic
@GrumpyMerkel and @UschivdLeyen: #linguisticFingerprint
"@Smohly @fr_schirrmacher That&#39;s right, but actually I am known for answering fairly hierarchically :-)"
@RainerLoveiam respect! :-)
"@fr_schirrmacher 2/2: Twitter can be misused (e.g. bullying, #Lanz), but it has incredible egalitarian-democratic potential!"
@jmbverlag Good idea: at Minister-Germany I would definitely come to the final round with @sigmargabriel!
@presroi :-)) I&#39;m betting on you!
"I like to work for the success of #GroKo, but I&#39;m more of a Mister Germany than the SPD becoming the new network party! :-)"
@ SteffenMeyer73 @StormAndreas Always happy when Saarlanders think of me!
". @ GrumpyPeer1 Exactly: I may not be the &quot;most important&quot; minister yet, but I am definitely the &quot;most important&quot; one (still: #sigmargabriel)"
@StormAndreas @ SteffenMeyer73 Sometimes you just need humor to survive everything :-) Greetings to beautiful Saarland!
@sven_kindler Just not thought through by the electorate that it gave the opposition so few votes! :-)
&quot;Focus on people&quot; is a good guiding principle for the work of #Groko that can be translated into concrete work for every ministry. !
"@bas_ton Yes, he&#39;s hot on my heels!"
@christiansoeder Thank you!
@christiansoeder :-)
@christiansoeder Fortunately we still have the chancellery! :-)
"@BroeckelndeWand @Bugspriet Unfortunately, many have already left: first voters, then active people. I also miss some on Twitter"
@Hunter_I @A_K_K_ @tobiashans @rolandtheis Thank God! I did it like this yesterday!
@GreenTecAwards I am also happy and will of course make an effort! :-)
@MKreutzfeldt It was really thick! But somehow he broke your back! :-)
@MKreutzfeldt @dpomondi @MBauchmueller @birmars @Ingo_Arzt I am even interested. It was an exciting 1 1/2 years with all of you! :-)
@PEBE_FONZO you say it !!! :-))
@Flughundman you have to stick to the Ministry of Economy. They wanted to publish it. just look at their homepage
"@princemaarvin Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t always work, but you were lucky this morning. :-)"
Sit together with @A_K_K_ @tobiashans and @rolandtheis and together resist the incentive of the bread roll ... maybe ..
@Goldengismo Sure? :-)
"@princemaarvin Everyone has to define that for themselves, because friendship is always a one-sided / two-sided thing. :-)"
@wok12 ?????????????????????????????????????
@ Padde7 would be bad otherwise! :-)
@PHoicke :-)
"@PHoicke The question is, how do you judge @sigmargabriel&#39;s suggestions? Do you remember what you said about mine?"
@ Hobbyketzer It would be worth a try!
"@Elektronews Oh yes, you know me: I have been preaching for 1 1/2 years that we need a fundamental EEG reform"
@suseclown I basically do. But the opposition also has to make an effort to be taken seriously!
@BnyaminBaykus Don&#39;t worry: I&#39;m a walking mediation committee! :-) But always nice result-oriented!
After the conference in Meseberg: The #GroKo can become a really good coalition of objectivity.
Now get me off the field.
@pv_forum I made you an offer at the time. But unfortunately you didn&#39;t accept it!
@PfeifferCarsten Oh by the way: the corner paper corresponds to the koaV when it comes to capacity! :-)
@PfeifferCarsten should at the end be called &quot;Twitter at it&#39;s best&quot; :-)
"@PfeifferCarsten Thanks for hint. Do not think that who wanted to &quot;smuggle&quot;, but text in the KoaV is better. Twitter St its Nest!"
@Thorsten_Schatz :-)
@Thorsten_Schatz Never!
@UdoSieverding @sigmargabriel @heuteshow This should be possible by Ash Wednesday! When are you back in Berlin?
"@UdoSieverding @sigmargabriel @heuteshow After this brilliant hit, it&#39;s really time for me to keep my strawberry cake promise!"
@Datentechnik no idea what it means - thank You!
@der_ypsilon but something from! :-)
@JLengenfelder It&#39;s always like that in life! But I believe in civilization progress!
"@ReussNicolas At least that, all goodness in &#39;14!"
"@ byhector149 well, then just join in!"
@red_hardliner Can it be that we are now in the same coalition ?! Not as bad as it couldt be! :-)
The New Year is not that bad: we just have to make something of it! :-)
@GabiKostorz Have checked it x times as a BMU. It is not easy if you have a debt brake u should limit the burden on future generations
@UdoSieverding @Elektronews :-) sic!
@schreiber @GreenTecAwards @bettervest It doesn&#39;t depend on me! :-)
"@Elektronews He is my success! Because PV is no longer a price driver. However, the wind blew 10% less, and no one can help it."
@ MEllersdorfer That&#39;s a thing: Are you Michael Ellersdorfer from JU-Bous? In that case: a particularly good new one !!!!
@PhRemarque how nice to hear from you! Almost 15 years ago we exchanged ideas in Berlin! Cordial greetings
@TinaWmueller you too! That was really nice for you up in Beckingen
". @ talwazir Oh, by the way: Congratulations Minister! Good luck, a sustainably strong Hessen is important for all of us!"
"@talwazir Oh, by the way: Congratulations, Minister! Good luck, a sustainably strong Hessen is important for all of us!"
"Now get me off the field! The more I think, I am convinced that the Internet is neither sick nor broken. The best is yet to come!"
@ christune0 good thesis !!! :-)
@evilteacher huh?
"@HuberColin Nope, not right now: The Internet is the singular, just like &quot;a parent&quot; :-)"
@norberthense currently nobody hears you. That comes out the same!
Why are the pirates so quiet? Maybe because they are children of the Internet who do not understand their parents!
"@tirsales Not everyone who has a computer becomes a nerd, not everyone who plays computer games advertises gambling addiction!"
@inuido @ Stefan51278 then it will definitely happen soon! :-)
@GreenTecAwards I feel really honored! With pleasure! The award is a great thing and deserves public support!
@BILD_Ruhrgebiet I am glad that you are there!
@martinkaul Clearly wrong! Have a look at my account! :-)
@ pr02 @Wahlrecht_de @ZDF @ARDde @phoenix_de Why not? Complex but exciting!
@ PsychoTR0N you have been more constructive! Giving up doesn&#39;t count!
"The internet is not broken @saschalobo But it needs protection - like letters, telegraphy, telephony has always been."
@Wahlrecht_de Why not? But it is astonishing that the pirates are weakening and the debate about participatory internet is not progressing
@Kroestoph Let&#39;s see. I&#39;m really glad you enjoyed it!
