"I also reject the settlement policy. But the difference is significant: the previous eviction of Jews from previously occupied territory, multiple attacks from the area of the opponent of the war with the goal of complete annihilation."

Why do I have to change my mind? Because it is not your opinion? A weighing of the fundamental rights positions by means of practical concordance can only come to the conclusion that a blanket ban on religious circumcision among boys would be unconstitutional.
And what follows from that? The stronger should risk the life of his citizens or soldiers because in the end he wins again?

You won&#39;t find &quot;evil&quot; as a word in any of my writings. But that fits into your victimization technique to make criticism taboo. It is time for German Muslims in Germany to defend themselves against this nationalist instrumentalization.

"ATIB in Austria the DITIB there, the German ATIB is an offspring of the Gray Wolves üê∫"

To what extent is there a conflict of objectives?

The weekend is over. Does the @tagesschau online editorial team have an explanation ready? https://twitter.com/volker_beck/status/954790133802381312‚Ä¶
whatever you were about to say. It is incomprehensible.
"Why do you have to play off freedom, data protection or marriage for everyone against social policy? Don&#39;t lesbians and gays include globalization losers? What is this denunciation of a legitimate minority concern? How much AfD is in this comment?"
Do you know what Storch said? Then explain to me that you are not inflammatory.
Funny the AfD Trolls tell me to shed my naivety about Islam and migration. AfD and AKP are wrong and I may be closer to reality.
"That is the irresponsible thing about German Islam policy. It gives free rein to political instrumentalization, it also frustrates Muslims who want to live their faith democratically and in Germany simply and without discrimination."
at AK Muslims @gruenenrw you did not want to believe me for a long time that this was part of the construction of DITIB and other associations.
"Does an Islam association @DITIBkoeln, @zdminfo, @Islamratbrd #VIKZ want to distance themselves from this and defend themselves against this political use of religion? I would expect that as a contribution to peaceful coexistence. https://twitter.com/volker_beck/status/955403495737356294‚Ä¶"
it depends on what and how to call to pray.

"No, they should pray for victory in a war of aggression in another country in Germany and not for the peace or life of the soldiers. That&#39;s a difference."
I don&#39;t know who I see where in the pictures here. I can see no evidence of terror.
hence my reference to the 25% or 40% ....
pray for peace ok. Prompting for victory in an aggressive war by order of Turkish government officials is questionable in several ways.
I would just give it a try.

Of course it is an intervention. The question is whether it is justified by consent (from the parents) like other comparable interventions.

Who speaks of a collective debt? But the fact that Hitler came to power through a majority vote can be denied as little as the fact that attacks on Jews and anti-Semitic measures by the Nazis in Germany met with no relevant resistance.
The Jews in Germany were Germans and no others. To make Germans and Jews the opposite pair is v√∂lkisch and anti-Semitic. Jews and Germans are identities with an intersection. Especially since Ashkenazi Jews belong to the German culture. They come from the Rhine.
