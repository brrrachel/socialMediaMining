Therefore we want to simplify it humans by free allowance with the real estate transfer tax: https://www.fdp.de/wp-modul/btw17-wp-a-168 ...
That is why we demand a basic allowance for the land transfer tax. And a reform of the pension system. https://www.fdp.de/thema/rente
"Right, but buying apartments is also expensive. Therefore: Exemption for land transfer tax for houses and apartments."
By giving a basic allowance on the real estate transfer tax + further reliefs for low &amp; middle income: http://fdp.de/rechnen
"You do not have to. Only if you want to settle down at some point, the state should not prevent this with high grESt."
Not at all. Property transfer tax allowance helps anyone who wants to buy an apartment or house.
We want to make it easier for them. Hardly anyone buys an apartment &quot;just now&quot; is financed in the long term. Prevent additional taxes.
... maybe someday want to settle somewhere and buy an apartment / house there. Then land transfer tax allowance helps.
Exemption on real estate transfer tax also applies to apartments and not just single-family homes. Building block of a broad tax relief of the middle class.
"Real estate transfer tax also applies to apartments, here the free allowance would apply. Additional costs in D are too high in international comparison."
"No, the allowance is the building block of a broad tax relief for the middle class. Home ownership should not just be for top earners"
"That&#39;s not true. Abolition of the practice fee, tax simplifications, etc. Our future plans there&#39;s the way 👉 http://www.fdp.de/wahlprogramm"
"If you want to stay, you should apply for a legal stay, so @c_lindner #illnerintensiv #illner # btw17"
Our top candidate @c_lindner also sees it that way and has therefore expressed himself accordingly: https://www.liberale.de/content/lindner-interview-ich-glaube-nicht-mehr-jamaika…
"Exactly, has nothing to do with the @fdp. https://twitter.com/SPIEGELONLINE/status/907153654934843392…"

"No, we have been representing the immigration concept for over 2 years. Incidentally, what @c_lindner says is not nonsense, but rather the current legal situation."
Stand for opportunities &amp; departure. Strengthen people&#39;s belief in themselves. Apply to us as problem solvers instead of legal guardians.
"Not cynical, but realistic. Therefore, want to improve legal immigration law via immigration law."
Why? The article clearly says that Lindner has correctly explained the legal situation.
"Sorry, went under. May remain, provided they meet the criteria of an immigration law. https://www.fdp.de/wp-modul/btw17-wp-a-80 ..."
"On the contrary, we give refugees the opportunity to stay here. Is only about 👉 immigration law. https://www.fdp.de/wp-modul/btw17-wp-a-80 ..."
Nonsense! Demand clear rules &amp; enforcement of the rule of law.
We have been calling for immigration law for ages &amp; concept for dealing with the refugee crisis for over 2 years: https://www.fdp.de/wp-modul/btw17-wp-a-80 ...
