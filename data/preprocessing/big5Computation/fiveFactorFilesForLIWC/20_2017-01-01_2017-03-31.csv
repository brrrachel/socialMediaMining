"No. But if you tax the super-rich higher, you have more money for better health services and more carers."
"You don&#39;t need an hour to say that you want wealth tax or top income tax, for example."
We can already imagine an alliance with the SPD + Greens. But content must be right: break with neoliberalism must be!
Huh? How did you get that. But we want to tax 75% on income from € 1 million. € 1 million is enough;)
"We want that. Our tax concept provides that income below € 7,100 is relieved, but higher ones are relieved."
How did you get that? @SWagenknecht has always defended the right to asylum. Is that right? Hardly likely!
But did he make specific suggestions? Millionaire tax? Property tax? Higher inheritance tax? No. So it remains phrases!
"#Schulz disappointed. If you want to work for the middle class and the poor, you have to mess with the super rich. He is silent about this. #annewill."
