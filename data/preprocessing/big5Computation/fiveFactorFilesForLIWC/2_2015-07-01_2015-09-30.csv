"It is a good thing that this is now documented: SPD RLP defends full veiling of women, thus falling in the back of the enlightened Muslim women"
Tolerance understanding of the SPD RLP: intolerant image of women # defending full veil + being intolerant towards those who see it differently
SPD RLP promotes full veil understanding that men hide women. SPD positions itself against gender equality

"&quot;Wealthy Greeks are moving billions abroad, for example to Switzerland. Http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/griechenland-regierung-strebt-amnestie-fuer-steuerfluechtlinge-an-a-1042175.html…"
"The EU is not a wish-what club, in which some determine the rules of the game individually and others pay the whole."
"The will of the Greek people must be respected, but also the interest of our taxpayers: no further benefits without consideration"
"With anti-European propaganda and shortened and twisted messages, the Greek government campaigned for a no."
The referendum splits G. A government that shifts responsibility to its own Greek people is a burden on their own country.

"The federal government is providing billions for refugee policy, now it&#39;s the country&#39;s turn - RLP has to reimburse its municipalities for the full (!) Costs"
LReg must provide municipalities free of charge if they are reimbursed for the initial admission costs and therefore their own budget would be free!
The federal government will make billions available to countries for refugees. Our demand: The money must be passed on DIRECTLY to municipalities
