"After the great result in the Netherlands, now the next blow for the populists of the AfD: only 6.2% in the giant-large state of Saarland!"
Today was great weather in Saarland: Even the #HYPE went swimming ...
So much good from Saarland today: the poor result of the AfD is a great result for the democratic middle!
SPD &amp; Linke have clearly lost in Saarland. It also comes from if you do not exclude red-red or red-red-green! Congratulations to Saarland!
Congratulations @_A_K_K_ and @cdu_saar on this great &amp; well-deserved result! Today we are all Saarlanders! #Hammer #Mega

True
"EU is ruled by EP (Europe-wide elected) & European Council (heads of states/governments,nationally elected).Where is the problem?"

More than 130 y after Bismarck implemented health-insurance in Germany: there is still an ongoing fight for health protection worldwide.
"It is not the &quot;German&quot; way at all. The principles of the French Revolution are: freedom, equality, solidarity!"
"Whatever #Obamacare&#39;s fate will be, everyone in this world should have the right to health insurance! #Human dignity"
I wish you success! With differences otherwise: The struggle for democracy &amp; Europe unites us - across party borders!

"It always depends on the direction of a development: the AfD was 15% nationwide in 2016, now it is 10%."
No. They raised expectations themselves and did not live up to them: AfD lost 1/3 voters in 6 months!
"Populists &amp; nationalists in descent: presidential election AUT lost, election in NL lost, falling values in D. Next stop: France!"
"As long as only the plates and not the doner kebabs are banned, you could think about it! :-)"
