@muggoNL The press generally writes about politicians - but hardly ever politicians about the press! :-)
@atotheble The Chancellor offered it to me and I gladly accepted it.
Welcome Mr Chodorowski!
"There has never been so much network expertise: With @petertauber as general secretary u @DoroBaer as state secretary, the digital future is at home!"
I am very happy about the new role as Chancellor Minister: Thank you for the congratulations! Now we roll up our sleeves and get started!
@SAARTEXT @peter_simone Always impressive how Saarlanders stick together in federal politics. We are not that many! :-)
@hstubner With MdB Nina Scheer I agree at least once in the PV!
"@JakobSchlandt @UdoSieverding @CoFi_juwi @DHoelder @orangesolar the faster green electricity can do without, the better for saving the world!"
@Michael_Bremer You only know that afterwards: result of the membership decision and balance of a new Groko! :-)
"@DHoelder @orangesolar But: if a lot of systems are built without remuneration, there is no reason to subsidize!"
@ JuliaLange82 best regards back! Unfortunately I only saw the tweet now
"@UdoSieverding @CoFi_juwi @DHoelder @orangesolar Yes: they will count towards the corridor, but their addition will not be hindered."
@orangesolar You can build as much PV as you want if you don&#39;t charge for it. Subsidies are never limitless
"@orangesolar did you actually notice that PV gets off well in the Koa contract? Incidentally, expansion this year is fully in the corridor!"
"My followers are all &quot;golden&quot; !!! Thank you and Happy New Year, have a good two year in 2014!"
"@MediterrNewsNet @stimmviech Exactly! At 40 kph, my punch is not without!"
@SebKowalke Thank you for the honor! They weren&#39;t bad at all !!! :-)
@pv_forum I&#39;m really curious to see if you can accompany my successors so intensively! :-)
"@PhilGermann Thank you, was fun - even if I was still half on the ropes!"
@Mr_Hoffmann We will achieve at least 80% by 2050. Whether and when it will be 100% depends on technological progress.
"@UlrichKelber @PfeifferCarsten @JakobSchlandt ie enormous additional burden until 2028, relief afterwards."
@UlrichKelber @PfeifferCarsten @JakobSchlandt it costs enormously the first 8 years exactly the period in which the assessment is most stressed
@UlrichKelber @PfeifferCarsten @JakobSchlandt Tightening the corridor and extending the compression were decided at the very end
@UlrichKelber @PfeifferCarsten @JakobSchlandt Finally be serious: SPD insisted on an extension of 2J: = billion additional costs.
"@UlrichKelber @JakobSchlandt @hstubner @PfeifferCarsten, for example because SPD has caused additional costs in the offshore sector"
"@sven_kindler I was elected to the BT-Kand in 1994. But if you do this at KoaV&#39;s in the Bund, Regbildung 2 can take!"
"@ sebh1995 Not even B90 / The Greens have ever made a member decision at federal level on the Koa Treaty. You know, why!"
"@Firefaxe in Germany it has dropped significantly. But the global economy has grown rapidly, and so has CO2 emissions"
"@ pjv1968 Of course, but with the maximum: never advise - be interested in honestly! :-)"
". @ Doppelgeist60 What from? From the BMU yes, but not from environmental policy."
"Oh yes, by the way: I am pleased that my followers remain loyal to me in my new position! Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year!"
"Thanks to everyone who accompanied, commented, criticized my environmental and energy policy on Twitter: gave me a lot and made me happy"
@QENERGIES No.
@Alex_Neubacher @BMWi_Bund spon has claimed &quot;the coalition&quot; wants a compulsory levy. This is dubious and wrong!
@energynet @ProfKemfert Too bad: The lid for the coal is replaced by the expansion corridor EE: coal is becoming less and less.
"@ProfKemfert Offshore was demanded by 5 SPD-governed coastal countries, including 3x red / green. There is no cover for EE, only for promotion."
"@KayaKinkel I have already made suggestions for industrial privacy with electricity price brakes, as well as for self-consumption."
"@ProfKemfert 2/2 self-consumption publicly named and suggestions made. Unfortunately, that was very unfair."
"@ProfKemfert That is untrue: I have all causes since January (electricity price brake) - exchange price, renewable energy expansion, exceptions ../2,"
"@UdoSieverding did not change my course, asked for affordability in June 2012! Now SPD is wearing what it has fought so far."
@YoungSocialist Huh? Which one? The CDU / CSU is backed by 41.5% of the electorate. Not been there for a long time!
"@deutschermichl @DHoelder @orangesolar yes, to prevent self-consumption consumers from contributing nothing to the financing of EE!"
@therealDegers :-)
"@UlrichKelber Oh yes? :-) PV reform, repository search law, Asse law - and we are now doing the electricity price brake with you! :-)"
@sven_kindler :-) You just have to earn credit! # Pizza-connection
@BerndKasperidus :-) the women&#39;s quota is in our election program!
"@JakobSchlandt @hstubner @PfeifferCarsten @UlrichKelber Back then, nobody wanted to accept that, now the SPD and CDU are in agreement! #Gone stupid"
". @ sven_kindler I think the procedure for the membership decision is problematic, but I think the #Groko Koa contract is super good!"
@UlrichKelber @tonifischer why did the SPD respond to our funding? She didn&#39;t do that in other areas
@UlrichKelber @tonifischer Do we really want to discuss which page made which suggestions? Unfortunately you were not there.
@jf_jurgen May you be praised! :-)
@MKreutzfeldt in the EeG says: &quot;at least 35%.&quot;
"@MKreutzfeldt You can&#39;t have everything: expansion security at maximum speed is not possible.,"
"@MKreutzfeldt The previous target is 35% by 2020. If this is achieved, there is still a potential of up to 10% by 2025."
@MKreutzfeldt What is clear above all is that there is a reliable expansion path for EE without overheating and blistering
"When we ate pizza in 1996, nobody would have thought that Volker Bouffier would go ahead. This shows that he is rightly MP of Hessen."
"@uhol No, it really starts"
@AGasteier That should be possible at any time?
"@Mr_Hoffmann @zeitonline If you make a coalition agreement, you cannot only enforce your own positions."
"@diebuergerlobby Yes, of course, like everyone who works hard. And success is not always as hoped."
"Respect for Volker Bouffier&#39;s step: If you are sure of yourself, you can approach others and try something new! good luck for # black green"
"Incidentally, there will be no fundamental change of policy and we are not a delivery service either. Just like this :-) # Voting order"
Can someone tell me why I didn&#39;t have a thunder for 4 weeks? Must have been due to the charm of @sigmargabriel and @HanneloreKraft!
@DirkHemmer @MarcSpeicher @ManuBrunz Congratulations!
@MediterrNewsNet @GuillaumeTC Germany has not improved there! :-))
@ Fischkippe Greetings for the weekend! The earth has and again!
@jonworth :-))
"@jonworth Whether You are left, grenn, liberal or even christian democrat: As long as you stay EUROPEAN it's always an excellent choice! :-)"
@ mapro67 what do you tell? Don&#39;t you see that countries are leaving EE everywhere? We save them by making them marketable!
"@UdoSieverding @DENEFFeV That was of course a happy smile, because we have anchored the topic so prominently !!"
@BenniCandy :-)))))))))))))))))
@AlexanderKerk :-))
"There are enough @orangesolar suggestions. Eg from Agora, which wants 8.9 cents as a limit for all renewable energies. Lid breathes because expansion over corridor"
"@orangesolar in the summer, you didn&#39;t think we could spare pv from cuts. Now it is in the Koa contract and not right either! :-)"
@wolf_Sti That&#39;s why we have to break the cost dynamic
"@WWSPower expansion per month has been stable so far. Should it sag under the corridor, the breathing lid will react to it."
@WWSPower The Brussels process was initiated by the solar industry itself. Expansion will be above the corridor in 2013!
@dipead If you didn&#39;t notice: I am FOR stricter emission standards for cars - the argument is only about how!
@UdoSieverding anytime and gladly! If you bring the cake with you ...
@VedderWWF @UdoSieverding we hope so!
"@UdoSieverding that&#39;s true, at least if you don&#39;t count the certificate of dismissal."
@gemuellert @MichaelBroecker :-))
"@MichaelBroecker With the Greens it would have been Pizza Tuttifrutti, with the SPD it would be Steak mi Fries!"
@orangesolar @goettingereu This is totally wrong: I am campaigning for a reduction from 135g to 95g. It&#39;s all about distance u speed
@emsbabelsberg the level of reasoning is very remarkable.
@orangesolar What do you actually say about AGORA / Baake&#39;s proposals for the new regulation of PV subsidies?
"Would it have been so bad if the Greens and CDU had developed common concepts for climate protection, the energy transition and the circular economy ..."
@MKreutzfeldt blockade? I have shown ways in which the RL can be adopted - faster than some think!
Much inaccurate is said about CO2 limit values: We want to find a solution that serves the climate and environmental protection equally
Very philosophical: the gray seal! #einbuchstabedanebentiere

@c_lindner You shouldn&#39;t berate those who seek help! Especially if your own BT parliamentary group co-decided on the law
Looking forward to Markus Lanz tonight.
@EnergiewendeGER @FrankSchwabe It´s not the name that matters but content. And instruments of course. I believe in ETS but it needs reform!
@HubertWeiger You can also talk about everything badly and then wonder that people lose their desire ...
@kuminaidoo indeed it can. Germany is an Exempel for that!
“@HeinenUlla: Climate finance is being negotiated today. @peteraltmaier at the climate conference in # warschau2013 #BMU pic.twitter.com/H4khHgiG4n ”
"@JTrittin We could have changed that together in a coalition, right ?!"
@rainerschund Weiss not exactly ... :-))

"@ hschroeder1 the 3-volume work by Hoffmann, who as editor of Hamburger Nachrichten published Bismarck&#39;s viewpoints for 8 years."
“@PSHerbst: recommends #Saartalk with @peteraltmaier (#CDU) &amp; @peter_simone (# Grüne) tomorrow 6.15pm #SR. Excerpts in # SaarbrückerZeitung ”
"@MGrosseBroemer @babetteschefin @brihasselmann Yes, and of course it also meant the Bundestag election!"
@ulfposh :-))
@ulfposh ditto! I am happy to read how Bismarck reorganized his foreign press after he was released. Has journalists!
@ulfposh :-)
"Happy Birthday @MGrosseBroemer, Congratulation and jubilation! You are the 1st PGF with the best election result so far in this millennium!"
Many thanks to the @Schueler_Union for the invitation to # BST14! You are a great team! Good luck!

@GregHands Congratulation + jubilation. Good luck + Inspiration! Having served as Chief Whip myself I still remember how thrilling that was!
Looking forward to Günther Jauch and exciting discussions with @HanneloreKraft and Theo Waigel!
@JochenFlasbarth @klimagesetznrw @dlf Exactly like that! :-)
@robinalexander_ :-))))))))))))))
"@KonstantinNotz But you already know that there is no imperative mandate towards EU commissioners. In addition, the energy mix is national!"
@KonstantinNotz Do we actually want to coalition or polemize ??? :-)
What distinguishes our political culture: Democratic parties are able to talk and agree with each other. Coalize instead of polemize.
@LongoFL Have I actually congratulated you on your party&#39;s election success?
@GuillaumeTC @MediterrNewsNet Good evening!
@ Mibo6 Thanks! Encourage me!
@Oliver_Krischer An increase of around 0.8 cents is remarkable. &#39;Trittin wanted to make electricity cheaper? :-)))
@trebbianos you are just awesome! :-)))))
@MediterrNewsNet @GuillaumeTC I appreciate all kinds of crossbreeding - this is the final proof of the revolutionary spirit that inhabits me! :-)
@ polis2_0 To be honest: That was decided under red / green!
@smuellermdb Congratulations to @dorobaer for the golden sports badge! Will soon make my golden mock badge. Are you participating? :-)
"@MKreutzfeldt, I answered that positively x times before the election: but it is not appropriate to do it before subject-matter negotiations begin"
@broeselbub With humor everything is easier !!!! Good night!
@Flow_Joe Logo!!!! :-))
@ polis2_0 wrong: I said the social security funds are full! That means: without premium increases
@mc_hopper :-))
@ThPerzl Thanks! Always happy if it was not for nothing!
@broeselbub Thank you!
@MKreutzfeldt Why? But I think it is improper if you constantly appoint yourself. Modesty ...
@curryguide @broeselbub That was my luck! :-))
@Don_Waschbaer @zdf the chair was super good! Even by my standards! :-))
"At Photovaltaik, we passed a law in 2012 that guarantees high expansion at low cost. So I&#39;m against deterioration."
"@felixwunderlich @KlimagesetzNRW I&#39;m guaranteed not to say goodbye. Backloading has already been agreed, we can do the rest!"
@teresniak the two go together.
@Klaus_Mueller Congratulations! This is great and should go to school! You listened to the energy transition and climate protection succeed!
@JB_Baroni @CHedegaardEU It is a CDU/CSU/SPD Agreement
@ Aotto1968_2 way !!!!!! :-)
@GuentherWWF Every beginning is difficult! :-)
"@der_bruehl you too, was a typo"
"@MKreutzfeldt should be there, of course, was a typo"
Good news for the climate: today the CDU / CSU have agreed to make European emissions trading afloat again #backloading
"@jaustjos man, that&#39;s a surprise! It was a nice evening the other day! And greetings to the hiking club &quot;Wuschiger Lilac&quot; :-)"
@Nuklearia @FinkeDouble @BabettesChefin @UrsBolt @chorherr there are many things that nobody knows if and when they work.
@pierre_dubois @morgenmagazin And the role is: after my appearance it seems even more !!! :-))
"Thanks to my 50,000th follower! And the 49,999 others too !! :-) It&#39;s great fun and now I&#39;m back! Tweet you, read you!"
@MarkusFerber We agreed with the BMWi!
"@Minister_Remmel Hä? Schaeffler suffers from &quot;global&quot; overcapacity - in Germany, the expansion of wind power grew during my tenure!"
@UdoSieverding Well then. We have to eat strawberry cake. Very urgent! :-)
@WWSPower It&#39;s great if we even exceed the expansion corridor in this way! Shows how good PV is now!
