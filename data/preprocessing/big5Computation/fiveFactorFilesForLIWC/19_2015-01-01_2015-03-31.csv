The Greek crisis is also a profitable business for Germany. The federal increase is causing us morally serious harm.
The federal government has received € 360 million in interest payments for relief loans from Greece since 2010. Do you finance Schäuble&#39;s Black Zero?
@rosaluxnyc Thanks to New York!
@ TheFatHippo13 But not if I give the borrower an aid package only for banks / creditors and only under a strict austerity dictation.

Of course we have to protect youth and children and we have to educate. We have to treat cannabis like alcohol.
"I am strictly for the decriminalization of cannabis. When I criminalize cannabis, I only make the wrong people rich."
It is good that the Chancellor has recognized that the new Greek head of government does not just appear to her for the rapport @atsipras
@Exil_Inselette That was not meant to be racist. Any creative protest is of course good and important.

"By allowing poverty at all, the state robs children of poorer parents of the opportunity to have an equivalent start in life."
The government policies of the past few decades have made poverty an inherited disease for us.
@Sphlix ;-)
"After the headscarf judgment, the federal and state governments have to stop putting everything and everyone under any general suspicion."
"I wouldn&#39;t have cared if my daughter had a Muslim math, Catholic sports or atheist English teacher."
The headscarf ban is a double discriminatory professional ban - only against members of a religious community and against women.
"@ ThomasMeisner98 Please write an email to gregor.gysi@bundestag.de and when, where and what I should come to. Maybe it works."
"With her refusal, Merkel denies the 65 million dead of World War II the necessary and complete honorary commemoration."

Juncker&#39;s EU army: what will become of the nuclear weapons of France and Great Britain?
Europe needs a civilian foreign and security policy concept for a common European diplomacy.

NATO + Russia have to do without any powerhouse. The Bundeswehr&#39;s participation in the maneuver is also historically completely wrong.

I urge all sides not to exploit Boris Nemtsov&#39;s murder in the current East-West conflict.
Each of the five United Nations veto powers must first apply the highest moral standards to itself. #Nemzow
Government critics in many countries fear for their security. The fact that Russia is no exception also shows democratic deficits.
I express my deepest condolences to the bereaved of Boris Nemzow. This cowardly deed must not go unpunished legally.

Minimum wages + building renovation show that agreements in #GroKo today cannot be worth anything the next day.

"We do not need a German Europe, but a Europeanized Germany."
The Federal Government has failed to commit Europe to the 2010 agenda. #Greece
"The Tsipras government must be supported to freeze foreign accounts of Greeks with more than € 200,000 and to report them to the tax authorities."
@Biophilistin The reform program presented by Greece shows a first way out of the previous reduction and impoverishment logic.
The Tsipras government focuses on combating tax evasion + corruption + fair taxation of wealthy Greeks.
The Tsipras government is correcting the most devastating social + humanitarian effects of the austerity programs enforced through troika.
Credibility requires that Western governments admit their foreign policy failure as a military strategy. #Afghanistan
The West must change from the role of the occupier to the role of a credible partner for Afghan civil society.
The new leadership in Kabul can only find a peaceful perspective for Afghanistan in a regional solution with its neighboring countries.

Refraining from torture is a prerequisite for states to regain their moral authority in the fight against terrorism.
"No state has the right to subject its citizens to torture or other cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment. #RaifBadawi"
The bestial judgment against #RaifBadawi belongs to the Middle Ages in terms of civilization. The federal government must obtain for his release.

"Redistribution from top to bottom is not only necessary and more than just, but also a contribution to the creation of world peace."
How long do governments around the world want to accept the victims of the increasingly brutal distribution wars? #Oxfam
How long does the federal government want to allow the absurd overweight of possessions to overwhelm social peace in our country?
"According to #Oxfam, the world&#39;s 80 richest have as much wealth as 3.5 billion people. Do we want to wait until everything belongs to them?"
The suggestion to rent the Chancellor&#39;s Office canteen with Franz Müntefering for a birthday party encourages me to think.
