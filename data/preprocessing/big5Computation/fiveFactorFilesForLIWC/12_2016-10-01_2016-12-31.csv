"@thorsten_winter @docmorris @faznet As always: prohibition is the wrong way, there must be further competition. CL"

Stick to it: fair competition for #Bundespraesident is good for our democracy. Union and SPD should put up best personalities. CL
Find the courage to combine fashion e-mobility with a few common sense arguments. :-) CL

At the same time @dieLinke praises Russia policy #Steinmeier: raises doubts. Question if @sigmargabriel even seriously suggested him? CL
