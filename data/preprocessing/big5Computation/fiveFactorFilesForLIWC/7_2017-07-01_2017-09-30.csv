"Education, care when does that come in #TVDuell? Oh, Merkel wanted a #TV duel at most."
Justice is treated like a footnote in #TVDuell. Passes the reality of life of many people. Merkel doesn&#39;t say anything about it.

Merkel &quot;horrified and pissed off&quot; because of diesel fraud but she doesn&#39;t want to do anything. @MartinSchulz crystal clear on the consumer side. #TVDuell

"City tour + good discussions about urban development in Oldenburg. With Bettina Hagedorn in Neustadt, then Oldenburg and now to Fehmarn."
"#TVDuell shows crystal clear: Merkel wants little else, nothing better and most of all preferably not at all. #Martinpowers with clear ideas."
Merkel criticizes Sch√§uble about retirement - but says nothing specific. Merkel is as credible as with the CSU toll. With me it won&#39;t be ... #TVDuell
"Clear announcements by @MartinSchulz on the subject of social justice at work, education, family, rent, pension. Merkel is bubbling. #TVDuell"
Where&#39;s the domestic policy? #TVDuell
Clear words also about Donald Trump&#39;s irresponsible politics by @MartinSchulz in #TVDuell Ms. Merkel speaks of many worries.
"&quot;It&#39;s over now,&quot; @MartinSchulz says to Erdogan. #jetztistschulz #TVDuell"
"At Erdogan and Turkey, @MartinSchulz is on the road with clear words, Ms. Merkel with waving phrases. #TVDuell"
Leader of the C party with pointed fingers during family reunification. @MartinSchulz with a clear commitment to the Basic Law Article 1 #TVDuell
Merkel for academic immigration but against immigration law. Nothing concrete on humanitarian issues. #TVDuell
@MartinSchulz speaks plain text in the #TVDuell. Ms. Merkel does not answer any questions directly or in clear sentences. Also applies to immigration.
Humanity towards a large majority of refugees and harshness towards threats - that is @MartinSchulz&#39;s clear line in the #TVDuell
Errors at de Maiziere&#39;s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees are clearly identified by @MartinSchulz. #TVDuell
Clear words from @MartinSchulz against the dictator Erdogan and the negative development in Turkey. #TVDuell
"Integration is a joint task. Don&#39;t discredit religion, says @MartinSchulz hate preachers have no business here. #TVDuell"
Integration is a generational task - honest assessment by @MartinSchulz in #TVDuell
Merkel does not answer the question about Seehofer&#39;s sidekick Orb√°n. #TVDuell
Strong statements on refugee policy and a common Europe by @MartinSchulz in #TVDuell
Merkel says it stands for measure and middle. Your statements about the future of the country are rather mediocre! #TVDuell

"I have never given sovereignty to interpret what is supposed to be left, conservatives, right-wing people, and certainly not violent extremists."
Is it so difficult to understand that being left and being violent do not go together for me as a left? Rights understand nothing of it!

Conservatives + rights can rage and rage as they want: Democratic leftists have nothing in common with criminal violent criminals.
"As a left-wing democrat who consistently rejects violence, I don&#39;t let criminal perpetrators cheer me on as alleged friends!"
I completely reject violence - I stand on the side of the last police officers. Violence is not &quot;left&quot; but criminal!

"In the democratic constitutional state, the police do not protect the right (eg to demonstrate peacefully) the right (hooligans, violent offenders)."
"From an ideological perspective, the glorification of violence is more of a right-wing attitude. Black block and hooligans are criminals - no leftists!"
What conservatives are demanding here is a confession that the use of violence is part of the left-wing attitude. But that&#39;s not true. Violence is criminal!
What is actually lukewarm about condemning violence clearly and demanding that serious violent crime be punished consistently?
"Justice, tolerance, peace are left-wing progressive basic beliefs - violence against police officers, incendiary devices, attempted murder are the opposite."
Some who want to make political capital out of riots here don&#39;t understand that violence is never left or progressive!
"If you are insulted by Mr. Broder, you have obviously said something right üòâ"
"What should be left of attacking police officers, throwing incendiaries, using brutal violence? This is not left but criminal! https://twitter.com/c_vogt/status/883631626361688065‚Ä¶"
Violent criminals from Hamburg may have dubious merit for causing a shift to the right that puts Cologne in the shade!
"Ultimately, violence benefits from political rights whose aim is to discredit what peaceful globalization critics are fighting for!"
"Progressive leftist politics want justice, peace, tolerance. This is the opposite of excessive violence by criminal perpetrators!"
"Even if the conservatives try: Masked violent offenders, hooligans, criminals have nothing in common with progressive left-wing politics!"
Peaceful protest against G20 justified. Political instrumentalization caustic. Violent offenders are not left-wing but criminal!
"For me this evening I will go to Bamberg, where I will take part in the Bayern SPD uphill tour tomorrow. Have a nice Weekend ;-)"
"Brute force discredits everything that should be demonstrated peacefully, and rightly so: Missing answers to global justice questions!"
