"&quot;@SWagenknecht you disassemble the party, you elude the debate and you harm us all with it.&quot; @ElkeBreitenbach #linkebpt"
. @ SWagenknecht: Only if we reach the poorest and those at risk of relegation can we be successful in opposing the shift to the right. #linkebpt #linke
"It&#39;s not about not diminishing our successes, but about winning back the people we lost! We will only succeed if we speak their language. @SWagenknecht #linkebpt"
". @ SWagenknecht: If today more workers or more trade unionists choose the #AfD than us, then we cannot sit back and relax. #linkebpt #linke"
I am promoting that the solidary LEFT sets the pace! @katjakipping #linkebpt
"We are pleased with the good results in the university cities, but at the same time we must not lose support in the regions that have been left behind! We are the voice of the victims of Agenda2010! @SWagenknecht #linkebpt"
. @ SWagenknecht: People have to feel that we are by their side. We were founded to work for people for whom no one else is fighting! #linkebpt #linke
"Due to the return pressure, wages are pushed ever further. Those who are not in top shape have no chance in this job market! That is unworthy! @SWagenknecht #linkebpt"
. @ SWagenknecht: Important task of a left-wing party: We must stop the right-wing advance! #linkebpt #AfD
We also have to point out again and again that these are two sides of the same coin. The AfD is not the counter-concept but the product of Merkel! @SWagenknecht #linkebpt
We won half a million votes in the federal election. And first of all I want to thank you for that! @SWagenknecht #linkebpt

We continue on #linkebpt with the election of the women&#39;s list for the party executive.
we expect the speech from @SWagenknecht around 12:00 #linkebpt
#linkebpt continues now .... first with the band Jamila &amp; The other Heroes. #livestream: https://www.die-linke.de/start/
Break at 8:30 p.m. Then it continues with the election of the party executive. Enjoy the meal! #linkebpt
. @ DietmarBartsch: &quot;Fight! Fight and fight again! And all together!&quot; #linke #linkebpt #leipzig
So let&#39;s take a look at our electorate. Why should the plurality in this not also be reflected in the party and faction. We have to see this as an opportunity from now on! @DietmarBartsch #linkebpt
"&quot;We will not solve the conflict by calling each other racists, nationalists, fascists or as neoliberal naive people.&quot; @DietmarBartsch #linkebpt"
"&quot;In our political practice, you can see every parliamentary vote, this supposedly fundamental conflict does not exist. In fact, we always acted together, voted.&quot; @DietmarBartsch #linkebpt"
free after Lenin: Socialism is digitization plus democratization of the whole society! @DietmarBartsch #linkebpt
. @ DietmarBartsch: &quot;#Digitalization could be the means to distribute work and income more fairly and to align production more closely to our needs.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
"The current situation in the party is different and that is unacceptable. That must be the end. We must not get lost in power struggles, try to bully each other out of the party and step in place in terms of content. @DietmarBartsch #linkebpt"
&quot;We provide district councilors and mayors. @ReneWilke has shown in Frankfurt an example of what cooperation can mean against the shift to the right. This success can be assessed even more because an Alexander Gauland has his parliamentary constituency there.&quot; @DietmarBartsch #linkebpt
. @ DietmarBartsch: &quot;Of course we don&#39;t work with #AfD.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
"A second ballot is necessary for the election as federal manager. Jörg Schindler received 48.6% of the votes, Frank Tempel 46.5%. #linkebpt #linke"
I have gained a lot of experience and would like to bring it into the role of the federal managing director! @frank_tempel #linkebpt
. @ frank_tempel: &quot;The new comrades want to oppose the right #culture struggle.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
A federal executive must organize the next successes and therefore be critical of his own party. @frank_tempel #linkebpt
. @ frank_tempel: &quot;We say: Hope and not anger must be the engine for a better society!&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ frank_tempel: &quot;It must stop that we comrades are in good and bad drawers.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
"As a federal manager, I don&#39;t want to assert my personal point of view or that of any current. @frank_tempel #linkebpt"
. @ frank_tempel: &quot;As federal executive I stand for the strengthening of the whole party.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ frank_tempel: &quot;We are fighting for solidarity and a solidary self-image&quot; #linke #linkebpt
We should work on our argument culture. We have to find the intersections more and move towards each other. Let us be smart! @JoergSchindler #linkebpt
". @ JoergSchindler: &quot;We socialists can make it clear how a good life can be created for everyone, where the market does not direct it&quot; #linkebpt #linke"
"As group leader in the district council, I got to know the problems of structurally weak regions. I would like to advance the topic with concrete ideas. @JoergSchindler #linkebpt"
. @ JoergSchindler: &quot;We are the party of # reason!&quot; #linke #linkebpt
I want to run the party in all its diversity and not in the interests of people. @JoergSchindler #linkebpt
". @ JoergSchindler: &quot;If we want to grow as a party, we cannot do without anyone. We have to emphasize what connects us. Let us be a socialist member and participatory party!&quot; #linkebpt #linke"
"Our members come from different parts of society, which is not a weakness but a strength! @JoergSchindler #linkebpt"
"As a local politician, I learned to deal hard with the argument. I will do my utmost to make the LEFT stronger. @JoergSchindler #linkebpt"
. @ JoergSchindler: &quot;I am working hard to make DIE #LINKE stronger! We have important elections ahead of us.&quot; #linkebpt #linke
I am an east child from Saxony and was a west student. I know the LEFT in the east and in the west. @JoergSchindler #linkebpt

. @ AxelTroost: &quot;#Greece needs more # solidarity again - both the people and the @ syriza_gr government! Schäuble-Zwei again prevents debt relief and the exit from austerity policy&quot;. #linke #linkebpt
. @ AxelTroost: &quot;#Europe is also based on solidarity. For another #EU!&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ AxelTroost: &quot;We have to focus even more on ´the public´ and the socio-ecological restructuring.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ AxelTroost: &quot;DIE #LINKE also has economic and financial policy expertise.&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ tpflueger: &quot;We want # disarmament! We demand an end to armaments production!&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ tpflueger: &quot;There must be no combat drones for the #Bundeswehr! The #NATO is an alliance of uncertainty - and it must be dissolved!&quot; #linke #linkebpt
. @ tpflueger: &quot;Finally stop the military transports from the airport #Leipzig!&quot; #linke #linkebpt
"On Flickr you can find new photos, also of the candidates for the position of deputy party leader: https://www.flickr.com/photos/die_linke/42694687121/… #linkebpt"
"Ali Al-Dailami: &quot;The error lies in the system, in #capitalism! Our answer is called socialist #democracy!&quot; #linkebpt #linke #leipzig"
"The application: &quot;Complying with international law - saving the nuclear deal with Iran&quot; is currently being jointly presented by @katjakipping, @b_riexinger, @SWagenknecht and @DietmarBartsch. We are the friend&#39;s party! #linkebpt"
"But the European economy, the ecological one. Issues in Europe, the prevention of wars on this continent, the social issue and above all the increasingly European youth demand European integration and not the opposite. @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
. @ GregorGysi: &quot;The individual nation states should no longer allow corporations and banks to play off each other.&quot; #linkebpt #leizpig
"&quot;Of course, we must also try to win right-wing voters, but not by accommodating them in the way we reject them, but only by convincing them otherwise.&quot; @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
"The individual nation states may no longer allow corporations and banks to play each other off. The time when, for example, Ireland campaigned for itself with the lowest taxes, social and ecological standards should no longer exist. @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
. @ GregorGysi: &quot;It would therefore be grotto wrong if the #left let the discourse against immigration of #right be forced on it. The left must become the opposite of legal development.&quot; #linkebpt #leipzig
"The right wing, with the refugees as the alleged culprit, offers the scapegoats for a seemingly simple solution. But that is nothing more than racism, inhumanity and also a fundamental attack on the Basic Law. @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
. @ GregorGysi: &quot;National selfishness is fueled by #Trump and Co.&quot; #linke #linkebpt #leipzig
&quot;We shouldn&#39;t start our struggle to limit the power of the neoliberal global corporations and their political aides in governments by pulling the boundaries for their poorest victims.&quot; @GregorGysi #linkebpt
"No refugee has the right to try to restrict culture, art and way of life in Germany, but every refugee has the right to try to expand culture, art and way of life in Germany. @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
". @ GregorGysi: &quot;We have to explain to every refugee that women and men have equal rights with us. And point. Of course, we still have to enforce that as a whole.&quot; #linkebpt #linke #leipzig"
"Integration includes the teaching of the German language, the prevention of ghettoization, the mediation in qualifications and the labor market and the information about our basic values and fundamental rights in accordance with Articles 1 to 20 of the Basic Law. @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
"There are currently zzt worldwide. 65 million refugees. Since 2015, 3.2 million of them have fled to the 28 EU countries. Vergleichsw. much larger numbers of refugees have to supply much poorer countries like Jordan. Instead of just groaning, Europe should help a lot more there! @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
"We have to fight that, for everyone. Our struggle must not be to exclude low-wage competition by limiting labor migration, but to increase wages for everyone. &quot;@GregorGysi #linkebpt"
@GregorGysi: &quot;Germany is an extremely negative example of social breakthroughs.&quot; #linkebpt #linke #leipzig
&quot;The demand for social justice wants to exclude poverty as well as limitless wealth that leads to poverty.&quot; @GregorGysi #linkebpt
". @ GregorGysi: &quot;In essence, however, the left was always a peace movement!&quot; #linkebpt #linke #leipzig"
"&quot;If the left wants to have a value, it must seek and find another answer to the social question than humanity.&quot; @GregorGysi #linkebpt"
. @ GregorGysi: &quot;But the big corporations and banks have ensured that the social question has now visibly become a question of humanity.&quot; #linkebpt #linke #leipzig
&quot;The LEFT must be effective everywhere and also want to.&quot; @GregorGysi #linkebpt
. @ GregorGysi: &quot;Today we have more members than a year ago! You have to be happy about new members!&quot; #linkebpt #leipzig #linke

"&quot;I want to make one thing absolutely clear: In our party, there are no racists or neoliberals.&quot; @katjakipping #LinkeBPT #ParteininWewerung"

"&quot;For rent policy, this means promoting communal and non-profit living and saying clearly: Rental sharks like Vonovia must be expropriated! Because living is a human right. Speculation with apartments is not a human right!&quot; @katjakipping #LinkeBPT #ParteininWewerung"
"&quot;No, our strength as a socialist party is that our analysis is radical in the best sense of the word because we go to the roots of the problem. And this problem is called capitalism.&quot; @katjakipping #linkebpt #party in motion"
&quot;We have to be the voice of resistance - and hope that there is another way. Bringing together both resistance and hope - today is the simple thing that is so difficult to do.&quot; @katjakipping #linkebpt #party in motion

"It is completely unclear what is actually supposed to be investigated. It is a truism that the #BMAF is understaffed. This results in many incorrect notices. All of this is known. You don&#39;t have to examine it, you have to change it!"
The three board members were not in favor of an investigation committee with the AfD. They were against the request not to recommend the @Left faction consent to a U-committee. There is no U committee with the AfD. There is complete agreement.
"For the events in the #BAMF, treatment in the interior committee in the Bundestag is sufficient and, if necessary, they are a case for the public prosecutor. Incidentally, the many tens of thousands of asylum notices that were incorrectly not approved are also a scandal."
No. But the AfD&#39;s goal is to use the committee to hate refugees. This is evident from their request.
"We are against the #Examination Board that the AfD and FDP want. Possibly. clarification of the events in the #BAMF is a matter for the interior committee or the public prosecutor. And the AfD is not about education, but about agitation."
The party executive decided with 32: 2: 3 votes to ask the @Left faction not to advocate the establishment of a # investigation committee on the events in the # BAMF branch in Bremen and to vote no if the vote was taken accordingly. #linkebpt

"#BAMF is about 1,200 wrong decisions in favor of refugees. There were 37,000 wrong decisions in our favor. (32,500 of these were collected by courts). So there were 30 times more wrong decisions made against refugees than for them. #Fakten"
