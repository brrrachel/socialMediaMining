#Gauck It&#39;s nice that our BP is now recording what the AfD is constantly demanding. However: not &quot;refugee crisis&quot; but &quot;mass immigration&quot;!
"FM #Schwesig (SPD) warns of sexual assault in asylum accommodation? Well, &quot;The ghosts you called&quot; - says the AfD!"
"Aha, also reason in the &quot;refugee crisis&quot;, which is really a mass immigration !? Then only AfD remains! https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/648411399320944640…"
Many thanks for my unanimous nomination to the top candidate to my AfD Saxony-Anhalt !!!
On Haselloff&#39;s (CDU / LSA) demand to suspend the minimum wage for asylum seekers and discriminate against German job seekers: resign!
"Ms. Merkel, Germany is no longer your country? Very well, then you are finally no longer our Chancellor!"
Germany will suffocate in surreal humanity if leftist ideology is not finally stopped objectively and constructively!
Health card for asylum seekers - this brings the CDU closer to the Red-Green anti-German ideology! https://twitter.com/chri28/status/638698555075624960…
"Instead of acting responsibly, Merkel and Gabriel only lament the negative results of their failed asylum policy. That&#39;s all!?!?"
"Riots in Dresden, Suhl etc. are negative highlights of a foreseeable development which our government is responsible for!"
&quot;Consistently deport economic refugees&quot; - UNHCR fully confirms AfD position! Are they now &quot;right-wing populist&quot; ???
@spdbt @oezoguz A look at the job market reveals the government&#39;s greatest omissions in education and training. Immigration is not a solution!
The left stop on the company of our chairwoman Frauke Petry shows how bad it is in Germany for law and order!
Riots in various refugee accommodations are just a foretaste and another sign of catastrophic government policy!
"@MichaMml &quot;tackling&quot; Schweiger is good, the published lack of understanding for the concerns of our compatriots is impossible."
"Schweiger&#39;s planned initiative is certainly worthy of honor, but his misunderstanding of fear of Islamization / radicalization is just as shameful"
"@AfDWatchafd @AfD_Support But not, just spinning."
"French farmers go on the barricades and block border crossings with tractors and burning tires, another &quot;EU success&quot; !?"
AfD is concerned about unacceptable attacks on asylum accommodation. Complaining blame for old parties through completely failed asylum policies!
