@tuckXO good man!
@gelsen gladly!
"Yeah, 2013 are elections. then it gets a little political here on twitter!"
@SPDMunster I&#39;m really looking forward to it! you and yourself also a good start into the new year!
@fraeulein_tessa @johannesfinke didn&#39;t you post that earlier as a living rabbit?
@siegstyle and I wanted to invite you to coffee!
"@thorstenfaas no risk, no fun ;)"
"well, I&#39;ve read the Steinbr√ºck interview now. you should do too."
@ACichowicz welcome to the heather district!
"@Kirchberg see no point where he struck wrong. I see some things differently, some things I would not have addressed. no matter. happy New Year!"
@Kirchberg oha. now you are leaving a factual discussion.
"thanks for good discussions, suggestions and ideas here in 2012. most of the criticism was also helpful. looking forward to 2013 with you! rock on."
@tarzun I&#39;ll tell peer

@cronenbuerger @ajungherr politik dictates the journis which questions do you ask?
@Kirchberg @peersteinbrueck or if so.
@ajungherr @cronenbuerger and once seen my speech in the Bundestag on #lsr? the main thing is. good slip anyway;)
@DoroBaer it honors me that you still tweet with me!
@DoroBaer of course not. just read in the BILD that you become minister. congratulation!
@DoroBaer back then when edmund still ruled and you still had over 50%. so long ago :)
@Kirchberg prefer a @peersteinbrueck with corners and edges than phrase threshers. one can argue about individual statements.
@Kirchberg and
@Kirchberg that won&#39;t decide in the next government.
@ tarzun happy new year :)
@tarzun kompliment!
"@DoroBaer well, doro. that was better!"
@DoroBaer g√§hn
"@Kirchberg hehe. no, we are serious."
@Kirchberg pretty much like here: http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/enquete-kommission-bundestagsablamente-forder-internetminister/7569882.html‚Ä¶
@tarzun you would be a good soci!
@tarzun one from north rhine-westphalia or in general?
"@Kirchberg yes, the best thing is for everyone to speak the same. then comes: politicians have no corners and edges. what do you say about his statement?"
@tarzun we were hoping you would say yes!
@kaibiermann nice holiday;)
@CSU_net @tj_tweets @dorobaer what is CSUnet? ;)

@CoachJoerg think no
@StephanThomae otherwise we&#39;ll both be sitting there alone afterwards :)
"@StephanThomae nope, but if the cabinet is not there, for example :)"
@hschmidt is just a thought. so it could happen.
@Nico @wblau I&#39;m going to say something in my speech tomorrow. I received 7 mails by the way.
what&#39;s new would be a nightly jump to #lsr :)
@wblue well

"Talk to the Bundestag about abolishing black and yellow # tuition fees. also say something about my home country, lower saxony."
today it is about shortly after 11h in the plenum about the abolition of tuition fees. black and yellow in Lower Saxony holds onto it uninhibitedly.
Wait for @deus_caritas_es! the @peersteinbrueck is only just beginning.
@MGrosseBroemer I keep my fingers crossed that Ms. Merkel also starts in time. on 22.09.2013 is over;)
@PeterMaHe @peersteinbrueck yes of course. It&#39;s okay!
fantastic! with @peersteinbrueck we have a candidate for chancellor who seeks dialogue. not only on twitter #fragpeer
@DennyRamone oha. I fear that it will become scarce. this week is too full. rather have to go to january. sry.
"Thursday, 5pm roll call voting! finally enforce a moratorium instead of many words! show clear edge."

@frederics and
"ey, try to write a speech about #lsr if you can only talk for four minutes."
@Sven_Becker I wanted to go too.
@BenniKoester because we make our own proposal and there was still no consensus in parliamentary groups.
@Dialogsturz yes. then you can see what an MdB does while he is not in the plenum. everyone is already active here.
@Dialogsturz you did not read my tweets?
@sachark you&#39;re right again @kayoberbeck @christophkeese

@Qullwer good research!
"hey google, i prefer to defend my network alone! #lsr"

@Isarmatrose please reproduce my tweets correctly. Thank you

"@PottblogLive @bdzvpresse @vonklaeden @spdbt take a look at positions, applications, interviews. spd will reject #lsr in the Bundestag. Point."
Steinbr√ºck wants to abolish the ban on cooperation in education policy as chancellor. the federal government must have something to say. #parteikonvent
@Kirchberg right
@Kirchberg discussion is not a matter of dispute. and: we need a pension concept in 2013. rather detailed debate.
@HartmannMdB good luck!
on the way to the application committee: SPD discussed the year seriously and in detail about retirement. process and result are good!

Has @patrickdoering already agreed to make its additional income public and transparent?
"@kahrs @ walli5 @jbierwirth of course! after the debate the last few days, everything else would be lying."
@neina_hh @sixtus all right. then have a nice evening.
@tehabe yes. but the discussion is ok there too. But politics is not always 100%.
@DJVBB yo. at some point I think there will be a djv appointment soon. I&#39;m out now.
"@DJVBB thanks, it&#39;s important to hold on. in the 12 theses we make extensive proposals. look forward to reactions."
@DJVBB we agree that this is not a #lsr?
@neina_hh @sixtus is that the reaction to the fact that we anchored in the rejection of #lsr? Wow.
@DJVBB what&#39;s in the federal council proposal what is so bad?
@DJVBB what suggestion?
"@DJVBB yes, it&#39;s a shame that there is still no reaction to the 12 theses on copyright. had asked for it. that&#39;s the point"

@neina_hh @sixtus right. nothing else is happening now. thank you for objectifying the debate.
@DJVBB that is a regulation between authors and exploiters.
@sebaso who is &quot;her&quot; now?
"@sixtus don&#39;t know the text of the federal council either, only the debate."
"@sixtus yes, but publishers have to prove it for every single article. that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about, not a #lsr"
@sixtus is that why the springer rejects the suggestion?
