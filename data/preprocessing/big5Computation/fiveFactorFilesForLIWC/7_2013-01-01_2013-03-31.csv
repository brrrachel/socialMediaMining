To rightly reject this ancillary copyright does not mean that no ancillary copyright is necessary - it is also reasonable!
@tsghessen all the best!
@The Brussels protection of intellectual property is not wrong per se - it comes down to the network-political how-to criticism of the SPD approach?
@DerBruesseler not for black and yellow suggestions but - as simple reading of the program text shows - under reasonable conditions.
"After a parliamentary group meeting, speech by BP Gauck in the state parliament, meetings with CDU colleagues and office appointments, the President&#39;s reception in Schleswig."
@UlrichKelber @peteraltmaier no exaggerated expectations; -} it is ultimately a black and yellow federal government.

One session chases the other today - but a few things worked out better than it looked this morning; -}
What a day!
Tax evaders love your tax treaty with Switzerland and are guaranteed to choose the parties that find it good - not the SPD.
"The chickens @ArminLaschet laugh: thanks to the SPD blockade, tax fraudsters go unpunished, millions of Swiss revenues are missing. # http://t.co/RWCx4DzR ””"
"I am amazed at what there is to read every day, even after 22 years of politics that is still a lot - some of it fits the text of my music tip today; -}"
Announcement: Recon in Causa Guttenberg (you remember the oversmart Copy &amp; Paste CSU-Baron?) Was hit by a tram in Cologne.
Cheap girl tricks and little brother and little sister psychograms in the # crime scene
And Kopper covers Pink Floyd and Suzi Quatro as well as Simon &amp; Garfunkel - I like that. #Crime scene
"The car woman is really nervous. Sister: &quot;Shimon, don&#39;t let Frankie down now - think about it.&quot; Great cinema # crime scene"
@staudner well - Oscar&#39;s relationship boxes are of a multiple nature; -}
@DoroBaer mega serious? Well - must be the southern German variant; -}
"All the relationship boxes - who should see through it: sister, ex, factotum, customer, roommate of the girlfriend - no normal ticks."
@franksteibli you have to go through; -}
Rollo down - after work music. Kopper with a difference. #Crime scene
Contact? He lives with her. She clamped and he let himself be clamped. Brenner went into custody in prison. Dialogues # crime scene
How sympathetically the ex is portrayed ...

Good mood at the New Year&#39;s reception by AFA and Dithmarscher SPD in Meldorf.
One sings about &quot;candies&quot; - is not at all compatible with my resolutions for this year; -}
Hardly anyone can be seen outside - do they all hear the exciting radio reportage on the North CDU ?! ; -}
Snow here in Dithmarschen is not gray and cold.
@DerBruesseler of clear edge can really be no question with her ...
@DerBruesseler I meant Chancellor ...; -}
@DerBruesseler Merkel is in the 8th year (!) Kantlerin!
"I am increasingly amazed to hear what Liebings, Carstensens, Böges etc. say about their party - the North CDU - into the microphones."
Listen to remarkable radio reports about crocodile tears and hypocrisy in the Northern Union after the departure of CDU chief Jost de Jager.
"@JohnSturges for most people, black and yellow anti-public welfare and selfish policies are not caught - if you explain that well!"
"Black and yellow empress-pardon chancellor-has no clothes. Childcare allowance, pension, taxes, health, precarious employment, cabinet-deselect!"
"You can have different opinions on each subject, but lobbyists deal with parliamentary democracy is bold!"
This is probably called foreign embarrassment when you look at the parliamentary gambler lobby friends Arp &amp; Kubicki &amp; Co. is addressed.
Arp &amp; Kubicki &amp; Co. seriously demand that ghost driving is required by law. They call that coherence. #Zockerlobby --- fail
Finally SH corrects the ghost driver course in the Gambling Act: The black and yellow parliamentary arm of the gambler lobby runs verbally amok!
Such processes are also considered in the case of rival parties without any malicious joy. Lack of support for attempted modernization at North CDU!
"Jost de Jager&#39;s withdrawal shows disoriented northern CDU. For me, the third CDU leader has been by far the most respectable colleague since 2007!"
@_drsarkozy sounds good - I wish that too; -}

Good morning from Bordesholm. Full day ahead with many faction and party appointments in Kiel and Büdelsdorf.
Music tip: a classic - Deep Purple &quot;Smoke on the water&quot;. Happy Tuesday everyone!
"CDU country chief de Jager supposedly wants to resign today, FDP farce, airport debates, Wulff private life, etc. better talk about content!"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Continuation of the household exam of the SPD parliamentary group in Kiel. Otherwise turbulent times in politics.
Reception at the Hamburger Abendblatt - good mood and positive outlook for 2013! #Only the HSV!!!
@TainoSosua is best to talk about content and differences to black and yellow and win Lower Saxony election!
Music Tip: Lana del Rey &quot;Video Games&quot;.
"Good morning from Bordesholm, the first week of work starts with appointments in Hamburg and Kiel, and the group&#39;s budget exam. Nice day!"
I&#39;m just afraid they believe what they&#39;re talking about - but it&#39;s not strange when these people are given responsibility.
"One thing has to be said to Brüderle - foolish speeches can be done all year round - not only in the carnival season. It&#39;s funny, to some extent"
That is really true! “@MSchmoeckel: @Ralf_Stegner With the currently speaking Ober-Jecken Brüderle only the ink and the Hellau are missing”
FDP acts as an ego bulwark against the common good. The so-called &quot;bulwark&quot; is doing itself - hopefully soon the other one too!
"Speech excerpts from the Epiphany meeting of the FDP in Stuttgart are reminiscent of carnival + satire. Niebel, Brüderle &amp; Rösler-too bad that few watch!"
Because of some questions: My music tip was not specifically for the Epiphany meeting of a small party in Stuttgart; -}

Good morning from Bordesholm. Fetching bread rolls with drizzle. Happy Sunday everyone!
"Niebel obviously has it with Schwarzenegger: &quot;I was chosen to steer, not to think&quot;. You can tell!"
What an idiot: @jfkorn: &quot;There is no discussion only in dictatorships and perhaps at SPD party conferences.&quot; Dirk Niebel
So what? What is sensational about it? 15 (!) Years ago! “@ ZDF: heute.de: Steinbrück wanted to become Sparkassen president in 1998 http://bit.ly/UrJfy5”

@DJanecek @gruene_bayern is there something in it that Georg Danzer sings about in his famous song? (Was that about H ....?)
Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;Eclipse&quot; on the LÜ &quot;Dark side of the Moon&quot; reads &quot;The lunatic is in your head&quot; - this was often remembered today.
@frolueb who speaks of lies remains benevolent interpretation-Hahn speaks German!
@frolueb I read a text in German and the subsequent euphemistic explanation.
@MartinSchulz rightly so!!
"@frolueb formulations are simply wrong even with benevolent interpretation, Hahn is not an amateur and the FDP-Rösler debate is not new!"
@frolueb I do not share it!
Today some combatants must have had something in their drinking water - definitely!
"Graffiti in the middle of nowhere: &quot;When insanity becomes epidemic, it&#39;s called reason&quot;."
Regular doctor away - honorary doctor here - hmmm - maybe today you really don&#39;t have to understand everything - wedding for political cabaret!
"Anyone who follows news with Hahn&#39;s Rösler quote, Schavan + Peer blog debate etc. would have trouble explaining alien intelligence to extraterrestrials."
What drug did he throw in? “@LischkaB: I knew it: Now the SPD is to blame for Schavan&#39;s doctor. http://www.welt.de/kultur/article113455288/Schavan-ist-ein-spaetes-Opfer-des-SPD-Bildungswahns.html… via @welt ”
@ walli5 in the debate about his own controversial party leader to refer to the lack of acceptance for &quot;Asian appearance&quot;?
"Niebel, Brüderle, Kubicki, Hahn, Döring, Rösler, Westerwelle &amp; Co .: 4% nationwide approval - is good value for the contributions of the last few days!"
FDP left by all good spirits. Political level in free fall: Hesse&#39;s FDP chief Hahn with racist tones about Mr. Rösler.
Now from the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund in Heiligenhafen to the district SPD in Eutin.
Interesting visit to Ostholstein. Great kindergarten and crib Mühlenblick in Merkendorf. Then at Kelco in Grossenbrode.

Potzblitz: The cycling pharmacist Lance Armstrong has revealed that he actually did not only experience victories with his own strength.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Driveway and stairs cleared of snow and now soon to Kiel. Group bodies and talks with the savings banks.
Constituency round in Mielkendorf with good discussion.
New Year&#39;s receptions from rival parties are something special; especially if you are constantly addressed personally in the speeches; -}
Ha ha- not laughing that long anymore - so humor has “@shz_de: Kubicki expects ten percent in the north: http://bit.ly/WF2Aq7 via @shz_de”
Many are only strong and brave when they roar in the choir or howl with the wolves!

"The widespread reaction to alleged scandals, which are none at all when viewed in the light, are cowardly diving away and hasty opportunism."
Again and again find out how it works to exaggerate and scandalize topics - even though it is a matter of simple disagreement!
@tsghessen in the shade it can get very dark; -}
Music tip: Facio Santillana &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;. Everyone a good start to the week!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. A visit to the competition, Kiel office appointments and constituency round in Mielkendorf on my program today."
@DoroBaer @ victor5679 @juliakloeckner were neither very original!
@DoroBaer same thought; -}
What a waste of gasoline in the # crime scene
Now the confessions aren&#39;t even right. Everything was planned. Quite a lot thought around the corner - but effectively brought around the corner. #Crime scene
Confession No.2 - now go for a weekend! And Koppers &quot;lonesome whistle blues&quot; - # Tatort from Ludwigshafen very entertaining today.
Can you imagine a Frisian buying such an object? It&#39;s not an art. Hmmm .... # scene
Hop on get dressed - we&#39;re going to the cinema now - next time I&#39;ll pick the film - what did they watch? Aha - now it was the sister!
It has a motive and a key - it&#39;s like in real life - and now the business is being closed - # crime scene.
With all criticism of failed interviews: In the real world - if performance still counts - red-green must replace black-yellow in Lower Saxony!
It is remarkable how the attempt is being made to make the totally run-down and discredited black and yellow alliance beautiful in terms of media!
Drive through a white winter landscape towards the west coast.
Music tip: Peter Beil &quot;Il Silencio&quot;. Have a beautiful Sunday!
Good morning from Bordesholm. It is snowing and off to the AFA New Year&#39;s reception on the west coast in Meldorf.
"Musiktipp: Bryan Adams ""Straight from the Heart""."
Good morning from Bordesholm- cold market before breakfast- shopping for the family. Happy weekend everyone!
Visit to the Bordesholm + police station at a very modern short-term care facility in the converted old town hall.
@_drsarkozy cool;-}
Those who watched the TV debate yesterday got the best arguments for why it is worth fighting for red-green policy changes in NDS!
"I am pleased with the successful TV appearance by Stephan Weil, who factually and competently showed the difference to Mr. McAllister!"
Hilmar Kopper leaves and that&#39;s a good thing - he was Carstensen&#39;s husband and head of the fan club of Dr.No-no respect for parliament.
Music tip: jam &quot;Reflections of my life&quot;. Happy Friday everyone!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today Kiel office appointments, press talks, constituency appointments and citizens&#39; consultation in Bordesholm."
That was a crystal clear point win for Stephan Weil against David McAllister. Congratulations to the next Prime Minister Stephan Weil!
"Stephan Weil is McAllister when it comes to fine dyeing when it comes to inhumane deportation practice, which is why black yellow must also be deselected!"
Lower Saxony is right wing in the refugee policy-SPD is for humane treatment of people. McAllister justifies the right course!
McAllister dodges softly around clear answers - hopefully many Lower Saxony will see the duel on N3. #PolitikwechselNDS
"Stephan Weil: Facts, reason, conviction - that&#39;s what the next Prime Minister of Lower Saxony looks like. McAllister talks a lot - says little!"
"McAllister praises privileged partnership with &quot;Mutti&quot;. He achieved so much for Lower Saxony, inherited Röttgen as Merkel&#39;s favorite."
SPD wants people to be able to make a living and Stephan Weil is clear for fair minimum wages - McAllister is against it. CDU &amp; FDP = wage dumping!
Stephan Weil promotes consistent energy transition and good work. McAllister filibustert at Thena minimum wages and pushes for plain text!
The black and yellow NDS government is still asleep during the energy turnaround! McAllister writes people-facts speak against him.
Lower Saxony can ensure a performance-based decision: CDU in opposition-FDP &amp; left out of the state parliament-red-green government!
Stephan Weil says that parents themselves know what is good for their children - this is very different from the stubborn CDU education policy.
McAllister says that bad grades of citizens for black and yellow school policy is due to ignorance of the people-CDU vote out arrogance!
Friendly backwardness - Mr. McAllister is against educational justice - another reason to vote out the lousy CDU &amp; FDP coalition in NDS!
McAllister and schwarzgelb are the last tuition fans in Germany - SPD is for education justice. Deselect CDU &amp; FDP!
McAllister has nothing to offer in the matter- Stephan Weil argues like a good prime minister for Lower Saxony.
"Stephan Weil&#39;s good, competent appearance, CDU man McAllister still relies on the black and yellow Loser coalition."
I agree! ”@ Olaf Scholz wishes @stephanweil all the best for the TV duel via Facebook. #ltwnds http://instagr.am/p/UUDWO9Q_Hg/ ”
Membership ceremony at the local association Kronshagen.
@ victor5679 na- stay calm!
"If the Lower Saxony vote and don&#39;t waste votes on the Left / FDP / Pirates, the red-green change of politics and government will work!"
New Year&#39;s reception of the municipality of Bordesholm.
Conservative / radical market politics of selfishness and against the common good has neither a majority in Lower Saxony nor in Germany.
Now join everyone so that the red-green policy change in Lower Saxony succeeds. Black and yellow is from the day before yesterday and must be deselected!
Music tip: Gordon Lightfoot &quot;Rainy day people&quot;. Happy Thursday everyone!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Kiel dates today. Excited times in politics-important and unimportant are not always separated.
@schossau for most of them; -}
"Nord SPD understands value creation for SH as good, honest, properly paid work- Arp &amp; Kubicki &amp; Co. but online poker paradise!"

Great mood at the New Year&#39;s reception of the North SPD in the Kiel dream factory - with Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel and many guests.
Show red-green alternative! “@ Politikfeed: [WORLD] Ralf Stegner:&quot; Merkel acts as if she was the side president &quot;http://bit.ly/141ngyD”
Oh: This week&#39;s employee of this Mr. Niebel from the small party inflated with a black Lower Saxony air pump should definitely be!

@DoroBaer @schlachtzeile hmmm; -}
"@Bojenkommandant @klaus_kocks @peersteinbrueck (almost) always win my bets, but rarely has it been as easy + fun as this time!"
Great performance of the Lower Saxony SPD and victory thanks to the closed SPD in the headwind of the published opinion!
From the RSH reception with the usual rustic Wischmeyer humor now to Itzehoe to the SPD district association.
