I&#39;m getting a lot of reactions to the SPD statement that the CDU is in a &quot;blood frenzy&quot; because it wants to solve millions of taxpayers&#39; money
"SPD GSek calls withdrawal requests v media, CDU, FDP &quot;Blutrausch&quot;. Was MP Beck i &quot;Blutrausch&quot; when he called Hr. Wulff&#39;s resignation called for?"
.... Demanding clarification and consequences at the #NRing is what SPD RLP calls &quot;blood rush&quot; because you disturb their circles and whitewashing.
What is that word choice? GSecretary d SPD accuses the CDU of being &quot;intoxicated&quot;. He then reproaches the media ...
"Sober, clear and accurate - comment in the @SZ http://bit.ly/MI3iEp ”"

What did MP Beck and his SPD have again Mr. Wulff and recommended to Guttenberg #moralischeshohesRoss @drmfuchs
Funny if LTPräs makes an appointment with the coalition and only informs the opposition. He can promote other majorities @ fgiarra66
"This is a formal argument, a strong president acts differently! @ fgiarra66"
Who did he have to be considerate of? “@ Fgiarra66: President of the state parliament could not have scheduled a special session of the state parliament #nring earlier.”
#NRing The bad thing about it: the President of the Landtag does it all. Because he doesn&#39;t see through it or because he sees through it? Both shameful
"#NRing LReg wants a committee first, the opposition should be an extra, if questions become possible, then the parliamentary session will push for a while."
#NRing LReg desperately wants committee meetings with ministers / MP before the parliamentary session so that they can use hours for &quot;their&quot; retelling.
Special parliament session only in 2 weeks. Why? Because the government and coalition fit. Procrastination of reconnaissance. #NRing
BT-Pres. Lammert would be sovereign “@ zimmj007: Basta politics also in LT-Verw. President ... delayed clarification. #NRing. http://tinyurl.com/cmsmv77 ”

#NRing Not d LReg has to be big: It is unbelievable to say that intervention d CDU led to a change of mood in the EU commission ...
For the fact that MP Beck could not prevail with his opinion in the EU to lead the BReg now is brazen.
#NRing MP Beck knows very well that he was informed about objections on the part of the BReg: No permanent subsidies disguised as rescue aid!
"Enough lies and denied, consequence of fraud on voters and taxpayers? http://www.volksfreund.de/nachrichten/region/rheinlandpfalz/rheinland/Rheinland-Pfalz-und-Nachbarn-Nichts-als-Lug-und-Trug-Warum-Kurt-Beck-jetzt-zuruecktreten-muss;art158726, 3223243…"
Didn&#39;t the green economics minister want to pull a bottom into the barrel? #NRing
