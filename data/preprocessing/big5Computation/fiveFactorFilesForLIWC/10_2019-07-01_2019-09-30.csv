@rekusant @ markrudolph2701 @fdpbt Some families can not afford it. It is important that more effort be made to ensure that children from such families attend a daycare center so that they are exposed early in the German language and find language models.

@SchrottSepp @fdp way we see it. The Zentralabi would be a logical consequence of uniform national education standards that target well before the Abi. Exactly such uniform educational standards we demand.
@Frei_Fink @fdpbt It calls to postpone the enrollment necessary. Children with language deficits should be initially excluded from the regular basic school operations. So you exacerbates social divisions. It should be a matter that affected children acquire language already in the daycare center.
