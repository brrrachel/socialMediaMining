Read my (German) answer to @maltehuebner.
I have been told that there are alternatives and the text that has been adopted says that interested parties should seek them. The mirror also wrote. And then mocked. I can stand the mockery because we can vote again next year. But I hate bad insinuations.
"How should that work? Undecided. We&#39;ll see, maybe already in the trilogue. But does this text justify the claim that you were in favor of uploadfilter if you voted for the report? I mean: this is an arbitrary and - unfortunately - deliberate interpretation."

The fact that a distinction is made between infringing &amp; non-infringing works does not in itself seem to me to be worth criticizing. I voted against Voss before the summer because text uploadfilter seemed to offer this distinction. Changes have now created a new opening.
"No. The author does not claim that whoever voted for the application is for uploadfilter, but doubts that the result is another option. But cites that the application expressly formulates the order to find them. He mocks. OK with me."

Bullmann (S&amp;D): &quot;Orban stands for the most corrupt system in the EU.&quot; He approaches the EPP party-tactically; not exactly smart.
"Manfred Weber for EVP: ""We have developed human rights, not Christian rights."" Article 7 procedure might be needed, he says, if Orban does not compromise in order to deal with the problems. Then he demands that rule of law be defended everywhere, not only in Budapest. OK."
#Orban claims that liberals and socialists want to vote for the Sargentini report to &quot;avenge&quot; their election defeats in Hungary. The &quot;migrant parties&quot; wanted to blackmail Hungary. &quot;We will also defend our country against you.&quot; Ovation from the Racist Benches.
"#Orban immediately starts a confrontation in the EP: &quot;You have already formed your opinion and you want to condemn an entire nation and an entire people.&quot; &quot;They claim to know better what the Hungarian needs than the #Hungary itself.&quot; With this speech, Orban splits the #EVP."
"These committees are all for an Article 7 procedure: BUDG, CULT, AFCO, FEMM. For the Presidency, Ms. Edtstadler says there is no rule of law discount. Formally, council has no position. Timmermans: Commission shares criticism of the report. #Hungary"

"Tsipras seriously answers Verhofstadt: The first 2 adjustment programs for Greece did not focus on structural reforms, which was wrong. But one-sided on budget consolidation. Right. But he also says that structural reforms were necessary."
"EP: Remarkable, like PM Tsipras&#39; effort to show that his government has managed to shape his own future with confidence, contrasting with the Jeremiads, who are from left (S&amp;D, GUE) and right (ECR, EFDD, ENF) Describe Greece as a victim of the EU."
"EFDD spokeswoman, after cursing socialists, gives Tsipras free advice to &quot;two hundred thousand times&quot; consider whether he should really turn to European social democracy."

"Ska Keller, and not just her, thanks Tsipras for his willingness to balance with #Macedonia."
Verhofstadt uses the Tsipras debate to argue that the EU has not been weatherproofed sufficiently for the next economic crisis.

#Bullmann (S&amp;D) tries to slip into Tsipras in a strangely paternalistic way by generously giving advice on how it can make the European South a pioneer of European progress. You can tell: Socialists want to make #Tsipras one of theirs.
"In the EP debate on PM Tsipras' speech, EPP representative Gonzalez Pons says: ""Far right is less dangerous than far left."" Did he really say that? Why did EPP applaud?"
"Tsipras: ""Racism and xenophobia are becoming dominant in traditional conservative parties."" He must know from looking at his coalition partner. - Other than that Tsipras presents just empty slogans. Does not propose a single European policy."

"If only women voted, red-red-green parties would be clearly stronger than conservative coalition, and SD would be weaker than they are over all. Greens at about 5% among women. #SwedenElects"
"With 566 of over 6000 election districts counted, #Swedish Greens @miljopartiet stand at 3,9%. Here at the election party in Luleå the mood is getting better, because that looks as if they will clear the 4% threshhold. Normally, they get better results in bigger constituencies."
"I thought you were one of those contemporaries who have never been to the Greens, but who supposedly know exactly what green is. I find that presumptuous."
"According to Swedish TV analysis, @miljopartiet gets 6% of young vote (Left gets 11% of young vote), while they get only 3% of 65+ vote."
"Swedish Social Democrats have lost 34% of their voters from the previous election; 11% went to Sweden Democrats (SD), 6% to Left, 2% to Greens. 3/4 of voters of conservatives (M), who have dropped to 3rd place, want their party to talk to SD. #SwedenElects"
"The 2nd poll looks much worse for Greens, just above threshhold of 4%, and much better for so-called Sweden Democrats, who would get almost 20% of the vote. #SwedenElects"
The 2nd poll looks worse.
"The 2nd exit poll, published after closing of polling stations, has only 4,2% for @miljopartiet, the #Swedish Greens. It has the right-wing coalizion slightly stronger than Red+Red+Green. And it has the extreme right in 2nd place with 19,2%."
"In #Swedish election according to first exil poll Social Democrats, Left and Greens together would be slightly ahead of the coalition of 4 center-right and conservative parties - 41%:40,1%. That looks as if forming a new government might take a while. @miljopartiet"

#Polens Prime Minister #Morawiecki was in the European Parliament today to discuss the future of Europe. It was an event of missed opportunities: https://bit.ly/2zaSTj5
"Unfortunately, I did not get the chance to speak in the debate with Polish PM Morawiecki. I would have reminded him of Marshall #Piłsudski's vision almost a hundred years ago: Poland must turn West, not turn East."

"#Morawiecki tries to delegitimise the political achievements of Poland since the fall of the Iron Curtain by arguing the ""post-communist yoke"" still had to be thrown off. Defends the ""inter marium"" initiative as compatible with EU. Does he believe that?"
"MEP Batten (UKIP, EFDD) argues that European Union is the implementation of the German Nazi ambition to control Europe. ""The Germany lost the shooting war, but not their ambition."" All the rest of his speech is equally venomous."
"Legutko (ECR, PiS) gives a completely anti-European, populist rant, calling remarks by Manfred Weber ""idiotic"". Defends the Polish extremist Korwin-Mikke's misogynist utterances of last year."
"Manfred Weber says, and he is right,  that #Morawiecki missed the opportunity to even try to answer some of the many lingering question about the future of rule of law in Poland."
"#Dombrovskis, Commission Vice President, starts his statement by highlighting how much solidarity the EU is providing to Poland. Per capita Polish citizens are to receive twice the average benefit from EU funds over next MFF."
"No head of state or government has ever received less applaus in the European parliament than #Morawiecki. He managed to avoid the words ""rule of law"" completely."
"Remarkably long passages in #Morawiecki's speech against multi-nationals, tax dodgers, globalists; even quoting Piketty."
"#Morawiecki attacks #Macron's notion of ""European souvereignty"". Pledges to fight that concept no holds barred."
"#Morawiecki: Populist capitalism means innovation plus solidarity. ""Populist capitalism"" - is that an interpretation mistake due to the interpreters' strike? Or does he mean that?"
Also interesting: #Morawiecki self-congratulates Poland for having been among the first countries to have granted full democratic rights to women. And then he doesn't say a word about the attempts of his government to abolish women's rights.
Strauss biographer Siebenmorgen about the CSU: &quot;They handle explosives&quot; - http://taz.de http://www.taz.de/!5514128/
"#Morawiecki argues, that every country has the right to set up its political system in keeping with its own traditions. My question: Is authoritarianism a Polish tradition? Then he says the Polish have a ""freedom gene"". Here I agree. That's why so many oppose #PiS!"
"#Morawiecki start his speech with provocative statements. He equates populism to ""democratic enlightenment"". He talks up anti-EU populism: ""many Europeans no longer like direction of EU"". In fact the trust in the EU is going up."
