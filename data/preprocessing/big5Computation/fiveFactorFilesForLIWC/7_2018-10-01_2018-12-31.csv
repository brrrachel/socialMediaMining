@AndreaNahlesSPD did not comment on this. It was about the rejection of a general social transfer payment for everyone with the euphemistic name &quot;unconditional basic income&quot;. Solidarity = help for those who really need it. https://twitter.com/_drsarkozy/status/1079416278870355969‚Ä¶
I stick with this being a malicious misinterpretation of what @AndreaNahlesSPD said. We are always concerned with good work that ensures participation + makes it independent of social transfers. We don&#39;t want a social transfer company. Help for those who need it! https://twitter.com/jess_kordouni/status/1079411081951539200‚Ä¶
I think that you can always talk about concrete improvements for long-term voluntary work.

"Combative speech by @KuehniKev with good ideas for the future and clear announcements in terms of generational justice, distributional justice, sustainability policy, global justice issues, multilateralism with a clear social democratic compass. # Buko18 @jusos # D√ºsseldorf"
"Clear - clear - constructive - social democratic - left! Enthusiastic, passionate speech by @KuehniKev at the # Buko18 of @jusos in # D√ºsseldorf"

"Living must not become even more expensive! It is long overdue to legally ensure that property tax can no longer be passed on from landlords to tenants! Ownership obliges, it says in the Basic Law. So Union, now you come!"
We will not tolerate attempts by the interior minister to torpedo the information work of the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the rocker affair by means of a ministerial curtailment of the right or obligation to give information to police officers!
"I stick to it: general reform necessary: independent child protection, minimum subsistence level without sanctions, rising minimum wages, basic income based on solidarity for the social labor market, free education, lifelong opportunity account for further education! https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/research-institute/der-chefoekonom-arbeitslosengeld-ii-das-prinzip-des-foerderns-und-forderns-fuer-langzeit-arbeitslose-ist-unveraendert-richtig/ 23687296.html‚Ä¶"

SPD Group demands the same strict standards for medical devices and implants as apply to the approval and quality control of medicinal products. The handling of auto spare parts seems to be stricter than the quality seals for human medical devices.
"It&#39;s good that the research network of the NDR and others have made the scandal about defective pacemakers, insulin pumps and implants public. It cannot be that people are harmed or even killed because of greed for profit and lack of controls!"

Today a few one-on-one talks in the office in the Kiel Landeshaus. The parliamentary bodies meet later and in the evening a round of talks with the L√ºbeck SPD.

Unsettling research results by the NDR on serious and sometimes fatal health hazards that result from defective medical devices. Apparently too little control and a lack of interest in the well-being of patients as long as the returns are correct.
"Shaking heads over the contribution of a so-called ‚Äúmarine historian‚Äù in the morning press, who downplayed the contribution of the Kiel sailors from 1918, although the end of the war and democracy would hardly be imaginable without these brave people. &quot;The world belongs to the courageous&quot;! It was on the posters."
The discussion about the UN Migration Pact is full of clich√©s and misinformation with which the right is to fuel the debate and stir up the population. It&#39;s a good thing Heiko Maas countered this with factual information.
"Large article also grievances in privatization in the care sector. Something like that comes from ... All the contemporary misguidance of privatization, liberalization and deregulation was at the expense of people. Services of general interest belong to the public sector - BASTA!"
"New momentum at the SP√ñ by the chairwoman Pamela Rendi-Wagner, who is already heating up the right &amp; right wing government of Kurz &amp; Strache."
"Either way, the BREXIT remains a serious wrong decision for Europe and even more so for the British, regardless of whether the now negotiated agreement finds a majority in the lower house."

Today first radio interviews with the Bavarian Radio and shortly after 8 a.m. on the Deutschlandfunk.
"Odd things from the green T√ºbingen sheriff Boris Palmer, who complains about Berlin conditions and in the Swabian province has annoyed students at night who have failed to pay homage to their head of the city in an appropriate form"
Sch√§uble calls for the election of Merz. Carstensen ruffles G√ºnther because he calls for the election of Kramp-Karrenbauer. Where&#39;s the üçø?
It makes no difference whether the ‚ÄúPrincess of Darkness‚Äù like Sayn-Wittgenstein operates in the state house because it sits without a fraction. The AFD is committed to right-wing extremist views and those who still have a spark of decency should leave the party.
"Morning press with reports on the exclusion of the AFD state chairmen from their parliamentary group. In the end, whoever belongs to the radical right-wing club or not is a must. The task for the Democrats is to fight for these people to soon disappear from the state parliament."
In the evening the delegates&#39; briefing for the European elections conference next Sunday.
In the afternoon I visit my constituency with my colleague Kathrin Wagner-Bockey in Lauenburg.

"Those who are really serious about fighting the causes of flight, not refugees, do not supply weapons to war zones + dictatorships, take care of climate protection + UN sustainability goals, pursue fair trade and food policies, outlaw child labor, control global corporations!"
"Rheinmetall says weapons will continue to be delivered to Saudi Arabia, &quot;of course under the strictest legal conditions.&quot; That is pure mockery. There can only be one reasonable attitude: no arms deliveries to areas of tension and dictatorships!"

It remains unclear how the BREXIT negotiations will end and whether the conservative May government will survive this situation politically.
In the evening during a panel discussion at the Willy-Brandt-Haus in L√ºbeck. It&#39;s about the role of social democracy 100 years ago at the end of the Empire and the First World War and at the beginning of the Weimar Republic.
Then to the first day of the household exam of the SPD parliamentary group in the Kiel State House.
"Today we start with media events. Afterwards, the SPD leadership committees advise on the European election campaign, the political priorities and the proposal of the party executive for the federal list of candidates. The delegates will decide on this in December."
"The Union wants to stick to the Hartz IV regulations - we don&#39;t. We need modern and fair social security without harassment and sanctions, without curtailment bureaucracy and child poverty. Instead, there must be new opportunities for the long-term unemployed!"

"My sentence &quot;who can work, it must also&quot; is not a defense of sanctions and harassment, but a plea for real solidarity with those who need support. This includes basic child protection, higher minimum wages, the social labor market and good work (2)."
It&#39;s good that the overdue reform of the Hartz IV legislation and a modern welfare state concept are being discussed. It&#39;s a shame that this happens in part caricaturing and defaming. My criticism of Robert Habeck&#39;s proposal concerns his departure from the principle of good work. (1)

Exciting discussion yesterday with party friends from Hamburg in Blankenese-Nienstetten about the situation of social democracy.
"It is not about sanctions. It&#39;s about good work instead of social transfer policies. Work is dignity and participation. Permanent social transfer dependence incapacitates, writes off, pushes off, resigns - is the opposite of solidarity. https://twitter.com/babman/status/1062743876170145792‚Ä¶"

Every job is worth paying for so that you can live on it and earn a decent pension.
Here again my contribution to basic security. Robert Habeck&#39;s proposal for basic security after a needs test surrenders before the digitization of the world of work and takes on the wrong premise that we are running out of affordable work. https://www.vorwaerts.de/artikel/spd-vize-stegner-bedingungslose-grund income-unsozial‚Ä¶
"Terms unimportant. Substance of a modern welfare state concept: basic child security, free education, higher minimum wages, social labor market with social security obligation + minimum wage, opportunity account for further education, citizens insurance for health + care + pension. https://twitter.com/christiansoeder/status/1062747953453060097‚Ä¶"
"We just do not want to spoil people and compensate them with social transfers, which are euphemistically referred to as &quot;basic income&quot;. Participation and dignity through well-paid work and solidarity protection of life risks - that is our understanding of solidarity."
"Unlike the ‚Äúunconditional‚Äù basic income or the Habeck variant of the basic income after a means test, we Social Democrats are concerned with overcoming the dependence on social transfers: higher minimum wages, basic child protection, solidary basic income."
"My criticism of the Habeck proposal for Hartz IV reform is caricatured. I am not for sanctions. My idea of solidarity is that everyone who can work, has to, but is offered GOOD work that you can live on and that provides a decent pension."

"Memorial event on November 9 in the plenary hall did not do justice to the complexity and ambivalence of the meeting of very different historical events from 1918, 1923, 1938 and 1989 and had to be rather disturbing, especially for representatives of the Jewish communities."

"State President Schlie tries to use criminal charges for &quot;betrayal of secrets&quot; + rustic public attacks to divert questions that are publicly justified, namely the criteria according to which he and &quot;his&quot; Landtag Director (CDU?) Conduct human resources policy."
"It is about to start at the state party conference of the North SPD in Kiel. The hundredth anniversary of the sailors&#39; uprising in Kiel is about Europe, again about peace and democracy. We nominate our candidates for the European elections and discuss the party reform."

"Cum-Ex billion tax fraud is a huge scandal. If ARD research is correct that the Ministry of Finance has known about it for over 10 years + laws &quot;against&quot; written by the financial industry, thus new loopholes have been priced in, an investigation committee may be due."
"Interesting staff debates in the Union. The political orientation and distinctness of the people&#39;s parties certainly depends on this. For us, however, this is of secondary importance, since we have to solve our political challenges ourselves."
"In addition, various talks today in the Kiel State House and preparation for the State Party Congress tomorrow in Kiel. In the evening membership ceremony in Schenefeld."
"Later on, council of elders to prepare for the next parliamentary session. The subject is also the process of questionable personnel decisions, which are discussed in the national media and are now rightly critically examined by the national press."
Today first a television interview in the ARD morning magazine about the situation of the SPD.
"The media meanwhile are concerned with the question of how politicians should behave with political influence in family matters. Conclusion: Even the appearance damages the reputation of politics, even if party friends are supposed to be &quot;helpful&quot;."
"Then in the late afternoon to L√ºbeck, where our Federal President Frank Steinmaier will give the annual ‚ÄúWilly Brandt Speech‚Äù in the Willy Brandt House."
"Today first the parliamentary bodies in the Kiel Landeshaus. In addition, a press conference for the upcoming state party conference on Saturday in Kiel."
"Angela Merkel&#39;s decision and manner of announcement deserve respect. As far as the situation of the SPD is concerned, personnel decisions by other parties do not change the dimension of our challenges. It doesn&#39;t make anything easier. So there is a lot of work to do!"
After a long committee day and a television discussion on ‚ÄúHart aber fair‚Äù on the ARD (it was about Ms. Merkel&#39;s withdrawal and the Hesse election) back to Schleswig-Holstein.

A lot of speculation about the political consequences of this election Sunday. It is up to the voters to ensure the urgently needed change of policy in Hesse.
A fanatical Trump supporter was found to be a suspected letter bomb bomber after delivering dangerous mail to numerous Democrats and journalists. The incendiary speeches are followed by the incendiary speeches.
"For me, three district party days are on the daily program. First to the Pinneberg district association in Elmshorn, then to the Ostholstein district association in Bad Schwartau and finally to my own district association Rendsburg / Eckernf√∂rde in Osterr√∂nfeld."

The Saudi government apparently is allowing itself such cruel murder because friend Trump in the White House is no longer making rhetorical efforts to uphold human rights. He has a soft spot for dictators.
"Today it goes for three days in the Hessian state election campaign to support @tsghessen and the @hessenSPD again in the final sprint. The Hessen Plan for Education, Mobility and Housing makes the state more modern and fair. Stations today: Breuberg, Sandbach + Michelstadt."
"Yesterday, parliamentary bodies met again for the first time after the autumn break. In the evening, the topic of &quot;tariff compliance&quot; was the focus of an event.

"Statements on the subject of &quot;driving bans&quot; abound with campaign tactics. Clearly, it would be clear that cheated drivers do not pay a cent, air pollution is taken seriously and car companies are urged to build emission-free vehicles that secure jobs here!"
Strangely waning arms exports to Saudi Arabia that are &quot;currently&quot; not possible. It would be an unmistakable stance to generally not authorize German arms exports to crisis areas and dictatorships. That has been my position for a long time!
Recent events show once again that delivering weapons to dictatorships and war zones is wrong. The SPD can and must say that clearly! Dirty arms deals with the bloody regime in Saudi Arabia are out of the question!
Outrageous data on the extent of tax evasion from dubious tax deals.
"Great success in the mayoral elections in Bad Bramstedt for the SPD-supported candidate Verena Jeske, who was able to clearly defeat the long-time incumbent."

"For me today, after the executive committees, I go on a week-long trip to Canada + to the USA. Many interview appointments with the progressive forces in the Democratic Party, which not only oppose Trump&#39;s America, but which also have something to learn."
"At the same time there must be changes in Berlin. A simple &quot;keep it up&quot; GroKo is eliminated. The basic meeting of the SPD Left has just highlighted what we should do with good work, solidarity-based social security, with ecological restructuring + global justice."
The conservatives&#39; life lie has finally burst. Germany is finally getting an #emigration law. The SPD has been fighting for this for a long time. We need freedom of movement in Europe as much as we need relief for non-academics and an entry permit to find work!
"You can also make a good choice in Bavaria, the best one is @NataschaKohnen + @BayernSPD Beat the forecasts with your votes! You don&#39;t have to be a well-kept state party, you can never vote for right-wing populists!"

The participants in the base meeting of the SPD Linken in Berlin called for the #Unteilbar demonstration in the federal capital and almost everyone is there.
Demands of the basic meeting of the SPD Left in Berlin will be fed into the reform process for the programmatic renewal of the SPD + will flow into a debate camp that will take place in November. The question of enforcement strategies in the SPD and beyond is also exciting.
"Motivating progressive position determination at the base meeting of the SPD Left in Berlin. Jusos, left in the party executive, parliamentary left, DL 21 + guests discussed good work of the future, our role in the world, socio-ecological transformation + our welfare state."
I expect the educational authorities in our democratic state to stop right-wing attempts to infiltrate. Democracy education in schools includes naming the enemies of democracy. Propaganda and denunciation portals by right-wing agitating parties must not be tolerated!
"Now, on the one hand, it is necessary to use all our strength to make the final spurt of the election campaign for @tsghessen and @hessenSPD more successful in Hessen. With the Hessenplan there are good ideas for education, mobility and housing."
Election debacle in the Bavarian state election. The governing parties of the grand coalition in Berlin were literally punished by the voters. There is nothing for us Social Democrats to gloss over.

"In spite of all this, it is important to take off the Berlin lead vests and make a dedicated campaign for @tsghessen and @hessenSPD, who have presented a good concept for the future with the Hessenplan! Politically, the situation there is different than in Bavaria. Keep it up is not an option."
Slapping of voters for GroKo parties in Bavaria shows that GroKo&#39;s durability is waning. There were good reasons for SPD members not to leave the country to the right after Jamaica failures. There is no reason to stick to GroKo at all costs. Just keep going is not an option!
Bitter election defeat for Bayern SPD. Congratulations to green election winners. It is bad that right-wing extremists are again in double digits. Natascha Kohnen had to campaign with the Berlin lead vest. Patience thread with GroKo has become shorter again - there is not much left! Keep it up - not an option!

"Grandiose #unteilbar demo yesterday in Berlin showed what is possible in Germany if the liberal, solidary and democratic, tolerant and peace-loving, social majority opposes the right howler monkeys who claim that they are the people."
"Before a week-long trip to Canada and the USA, which starts tomorrow, it&#39;s off to Berlin again on Bavarian election day."
Polls no longer count today in Bavaria: there is also a good choice: All votes for @NataschaKohnen and @BayernSPD And democracy doesn&#39;t start with PR jingle.

"The program of our base meeting is geared towards the required profile of the SPD as a left-wing People&#39;s Party, which does not stick to what is possible in GroKo when it comes to work, social security, housing, education, tax policy, Europe, peace policy and global justice issues."
"Even where good government work is done by our people, it doesn&#39;t get through. The CSU&#39;s chaos course and the desolate constitution of the Union are not only reflected in the polls. &quot;You rule with them,&quot; is the usual answer on the street."

"Unlike others, social democracy must structure the necessary structural change so that future-proof jobs are also part of the necessary climate policy conversion strategies. This has to be tackled consistently if we want to live up to our responsibility!"
"The current report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows once again that if we want to avoid the climate catastrophe, we need to become much faster and more consistent when it comes to the energy transition, but also the restructuring of mobility systems and building heat management!"
Later on to Berlin. In the evening I discuss with Meera Zaremba at a &quot;Forward&quot; event in the Willy-Brandt-Haus about the topic &quot;Basic income - future concept or utopia&quot;. Just published a post on http: //xn--vorwrts-8wa.devorw√§rts.de.

"Yesterday guest speaker at the colorful and diverse anti-legal rally in Fulda. Magnificent late summer weather, various bands and speakers - united the rejection of the right-wing democracy enemies. The Union and FDP were missing from the democratic parties. That says something from ü§î"

"After an appointment with local politicians, I had another citizen consultation in Kronshagen in my constituency in the late afternoon."
Then back to the north. Appointments with the European candidates who want to apply for the top candidate at the state party conference.
Yesterday evening in the Willy-Brandt-Haus a lively and lively discussion with Meera Zaremba on the subject of ‚Äúbasic income‚Äù. Later a meeting of the union council.
Good morning from Berlin. My music tip for you out there in digital orbit suits Trumps America and is from Rodney Crowell - &quot;Looking Forward to the Past&quot; Happy Tuesday ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYgDcrkg3DY&amp;feature=share‚Ä¶
