"Do we want to be friends, you also seem to have a social streak?"
This is a pity. Would you like to explain to us what exactly is bothering you about this statement?
We understood that and didn&#39;t want to deny you at all. ;)
"Well, the decision in the Council was borne by the entire government. There was also an attempt to prevent Art. 13. The decisive vote took place in parliament. None of us voted for it, what about you? #EuropaistdieAntwort"
&quot;(2) Men and women have equal rights. The state promotes the effective enforcement of equal rights for women and men and works towards eliminating existing disadvantages.&quot;
So you already feel attacked when Katarina gives authors visibility?
"What is this tweet, please?"
The approval of the EU is steadily increasing.
1) Is equality a classic SPD topic: https://www.vorwaerts.de/artikel/august-bebel-heute-spd-partei-frauenrechte‚Ä¶ 2) Do you mean something like that? https://twitter.com/spdde/status/1111327090039644160‚Ä¶

"No, we are surprised at the statement, because even in the Basic Law there is already talk of positive discrimination in order to achieve actual equality. And there are quotas."

How did you come up with the idea that Katarina wanted to be a democrat? Of course it is.
"We can assure you that @katarinabarley is a very burning social democrat. And for the rest, feminism is also one of the basic values of the SPD."

"Okay, then we&#39;ll call it the &quot;learning phase&quot; ..."
Of course we answered the question: You read it the most because it is the biggest problem in Germany. Zack. What exactly do you want to provoke now?

Because there is an increasingly aggressive neo-Nazi scene in Germany that is increasingly resorting to violence and is deliberately dividing our society and intimidating people.
We rather return the compliment :)
"This is simply wrong what you write, please look again at the results."
"So the tweet is about racism in all its forms. And besides, what you write is simply not true. Who makes an exception to racism where?"

"Oh yeah ... now it&#39;s getting insulting ... well, please. You wrote very nicely and showed us correctly. And now please dump your verbal garbage somewhere else."
"Well, you are right with one thing: The &quot;Strong Family Law&quot; is really good, but it does not solve everything. It shouldn&#39;t do that either.

"Then you have misunderstood something. Glass ceiling, men&#39;s clique, the problem has many names, but it always describes that women cannot participate as they deserve. The ceiling must be broken."

"As I said, it&#39;s about the list. In federal and most state elections, you also choose direct candidates."

"It is a matter of drawing up the lists equally, not of the elections."
Here: https://twitter.com/katarinabarley/status/1102856502287699968‚Ä¶
You raise an important point: equality also has something to do with the fact that boys and men are not open to all paths.

"There is a misunderstanding here: In list elections, depending on the proportion of votes, the list moves into the respective parliament. You probably speak of the German 1st &amp; 2nd voices? The proposed the parity list refers to the 2nd vote."
The reference frame is the population. You know that too.
What Please? How did you get that?
That&#39;s the topic of the tweet :) That&#39;s why we&#39;re writing about it;)
"Thanks for the picture, do you also have an argument for it?"
"Well that&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want that. That is what a democratic debate is for, in which political ideals and goals are discussed. We find that so few women in parliaments are not democratic at all. Therefore the initiative :)"
But there is a lot of Capslock in there ... We have already answered. Check out the comments again.

"Phew, now you do it too. In a nutshell: You are talking about de jure rights. Equality (see Tweet) is about equality as an expression of social justice with an equal participation in personal development opportunities."
Then it‚Äôs all the more terrifying that they don‚Äôt go into the things we‚Äôre responding to. The reality of life looks different. That&#39;s the point this entire discussion is about.

"ü§îü§î Nagut, then we came to the point where we clearly have different ideas: Children and young people have the right to engage politically, to organize and to become active."
"Climate protection is not an individual, moral problem, as these demos make clear. It needs social and therefore political answers to this social problem."
"Maybe you have to make it clear again: These young people organize themselves, become politically active and @katarinabarley supports it. Where exactly is who being exploited now?"
We are happy to give it back :)
How exactly do we have to imagine that? The right to vote from the age of 16 is already municipal in many places and has been discussed for a long time. #FridaysForFuture are just another argument.
"Nobody claims that, but a debate thrives on arguments and exchange and not on outraged scraps of words. What exactly is bothering you when @katarinabarley supports the political commitment of these young people?"

"So, we have to step in here urgently: Playing precarious jobs against other groups is a no-go. The improvement of one does not preclude the other. Logo, right?"
üôÑ We translate: You find the right to #HomeOffice good. Would you work on image selection?
That&#39;s just a building block and not an entire electoral program;) Here is a little more: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/detail/news/neuer-sozialstaat/10/02/2019/‚Ä¶
"No, but you don&#39;t believe that yourself;) We all know that this is about industries where you can do work from home."
Can you send the PM through once? Or a link?
Has so many advantages :)
"@worrius Hm, possible üôä Sorry"
Golf A golf from the kitchen ... nice slogan. But seriously: it is obviously about industries in which work from home is possible.
"Um, short request: what please?"
Offensichtlich It&#39;s obviously about industries where #HomeOffice is possible or part of the work can be done from home.
üòÑ This is indeed a funny idea. But we both also know that the right to #HomeOffice can do a lot for many office workers!
"We translate it: The right to #HomeOffice support you, but would you work on the image selection?"
Why shouldn&#39;t it apply to fixed-term contracts?
You have to explain the connection.
"Yep, that&#39;s right. In the party board, #HomeOffice is already being used intensively to reconcile family and work. In addition, a new company agreement is currently being negotiated, which will include the right to a home office."
Short demand: How many people do you think work in an office in Germany? 100? 200? We&#39;re asking for a friend.
Wow ... there is a lot of nonsense in your tweet .... but we assume that you wanted to put it that way :) Your argument still doesn&#39;t fit: not everyone benefits from free daycare - but it is right. The same goes for #HomeOffice
"Are we there, but the right to #HomeOffice is still right :)"
We agree: &quot;Minimum wage of 12 euros in Germany&quot; (p. 10) https://www.spd.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Europa_ist_die_Anantwort/20190218_Leitantrag_Europawahlprogramm.pdf‚Ä¶
"Phew ... okay, if that&#39;s all nonsense .."
"Stop. Introducing the rule that &quot;who orders, pays&quot; is correct, even if it does not affect the income situation at all. How should it be? But playing the whole thing against each other doesn&#39;t make sense. That is a building block in politics."
Now you&#39;re overinterpreting.
"No no, that has nothing to do with enemy images. The principle is simple: who orders, pays. You don&#39;t need a fine picture. And the whole thing is just one - albeit more important - building block: https://www.spd.de/standpunkte/wohnen/‚Ä¶"
We have to ask honestly: What are you writing there? Who are you fighting against and who called them a pack?

One can argue about how to deal with the AfD in comment columns.

"Ah, the AfD&#39;s tweet. Yes, the parliamentary group unfortunately talked a little about the topic and discussed de jure rights. There is little need to catch up. But this is about equality as an expression of social justice. A lot has to happen."

We enforced the good daycare law in the groko.
"If you scroll all the way down here, you will also find measures that should make training and the job more attractive: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/gute-kita-gesetz/‚Ä¶"
"First of all, these funds should make daycare more interesting as a job. For example, through smaller groups that the individual must look after. In addition, the full school is to become a dual education - immediately more staff and remuneration, which lowers the barriers to entry."
Which measures do you not like or are you missing? Here is an overview of all of them: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/gute-kita-gesetz/‚Ä¶
"As Lars Klingbeil said, for him the discussion about basic income belongs very central to the SPD. Here is his first contribution to the debate: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/grundeincomesjahr/‚Ä¶"
The federal government provides the funds - the states can then use them precisely where something is missing. All information about the measures here: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/gute-kita-gesetz/‚Ä¶
"With the Good Day Care Act, we are investing 5.5 billion in the expansion and quality of daycare for children. This enables us to achieve better educational opportunities for all children, regardless of their parents&#39; wallet.

The quality improvements relate to many different measures - from a higher number of educators to healthier eating. Here are all the details about the law: https://www.spd.de/aktuelles/gute-kita-gesetz/‚Ä¶
These are investments in the future of children and the reconciliation of work and family.
