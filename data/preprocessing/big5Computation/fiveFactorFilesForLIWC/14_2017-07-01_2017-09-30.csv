Family reunification for refugees with limited protection status must be permanently suspended.
A bourgeois majority is feasible if you support the clear course of the CSU. # btw17
The CSU is clear: Whoever wants to lead culture instead of multiculturalism and who wants the upper limit for immigration must give both votes to the CSU.
FDP is again in the wishy-washy mode. A second vote for d. Lindner Party is a voice against the leading culture and against the upper limit.
"We don&#39;t need Europe anymore, we need a better Europe."
"Juncker reveals the usual thinking from the Eurocrat spacecraft, which misses the reality in member countries for miles."
"We do not need a Schengen for everyone, but effective border protection, not a euro for everyone, but budget discipline across Europe."
The Juncker EU must finally do its homework instead of formulating dreams.
RT @CSU: We strongly reject an immigration law that would mean uninhibited immigration. #TVDuell
"The fact is: SPD-ruled countries block the classification of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco as safe countries of origin! #TVDuell"
#SchwafelSchulz
RT @CSU: Returns must be coordinated nationwide and carried out with all consequence! #TVDuell
The Chancellor&#39;s clear statement: combat the causes of flight! #TVDuell
The Greens should rather touch their own noses: The Greens rule in Lower Saxony and are co-owners of VW.
The Greens&#39; ideological campaign against the automotive industry is hypocritical and lies.
The @Die_Gruenen are a threat to Germany as an automotive location and hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The election campaign search party Schulz &amp; Gabriel swings the course out of pure election tactical despair. #Turkey
"The Union has always been determined, straightforward and honest in # Turkey politics."
"The Social Democrats, through their lax behavior, got us into the whole # Turkey problem."
@Spdde has courted #Erdogan for years and has turned a blind eye to the first human rights violations.
Schulz talks totally untrustworthy and therefore untrustworthy. His warning is probably a self-appeal.
"More deportations, more safe countries of origin, border controls and transit zones - the SPD and Martin Schulz vehemently blocked all of this"
One is talking about a new stream of refugees who has refused and combated all measures to limit them. #Schwafelschulz

The SPD and the Greens only got into the problems with Turkey because they have courted Erdogan the despot from the Bosporus for years. #TVDuell
RT @CSU: We say: Clear edge against Erdogan! Turkey does not join the EU! No visa liberalization! #TVDuell https://t.co/U2kIvuex5q
Erdogan has overflowed the barrel with his arbitrariness and the taking of innocent German citizens. #TVDuell
One thing is clear: Anyone who remains a temporary refugee in Germany cannot catch up with his family.

The murmur at the # government declaration in Lower Saxony is a tangible affair and must definitely mean Weil&#39;s resignation.
"After this red-green disaster, a red-green hanging section and red-green armchair gluing must not follow in Lower Saxony."
"Red-green has run down. If Weil still has a trace of backbone, he now resigns and clears the way for new elections."
Because he screwed up and has to resign. To hold the reg. Majority together. He failed
"It is pitiful that the SPD is now beating up an independent member of parliament, because that should distract from its own failure."
The Greens politicians must live up to their own responsibilities and start educating themselves on their own doorstep.
