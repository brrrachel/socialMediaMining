3. There was also the interinstitutional struggle for the role of Parliament in the Council. Macron treats the EP as a recipient of orders. We cannot put up with that if nationalism is not to win in the EU. Which would bring the EU project to a standstill. 3.3

Borrell: We share a common vision of the world even if we come from different traditions. Foreign Affairs Council must be decision making. Want to work together with EP. - Good applaus.
"Borrwll's final remarks: Our foreign policy must adress issues of identity, positioning, method. Will we use all tools? We avoid political discussion when it concerns big powers, and resort to technocratic answers. And we cannot be policy light and process heavy. More strategy!"
"Last question from EPP to Borrell: ""Do the Cubans not deserve free elections? Will you guarantee road map to democracy in Cuba?"" Well, well. Borrell: Let's not try to solve the problems of Cuba with methods that have been tried and failed."
"Gregorova: Will he get rid of his stocks in order to avoid conflicts of interest? Borrell: If you see my Iberdrola shares worth 12.000 € as problem, I'll get rid of them tomorrow."
Markéta Gregorova asks about arms exports. Is Borrell ready to turn Common Position into community law? Give the Commission the right to oversee the application of Common Position! Renegotiate to create more transparency.
How to save lifes and combat trafficking in Mediterranian? Borrell: We have to respect national idiosyncracies of member states on migration? But: Colombia accepts 3 Mio. people from Venezuela. And we in Europe fight every summer about distribution of 200 refugees! Applaus!
"Borrell apologizes in his answer to my question for his widely criticised sentence about ""four killed indians"". Short, but straight-forward. Fair enough for me."
"Borrell does mention human rights early in his introductory remarks, even though President von der Leyen failed to mention human rights a single time in Borrell's mission letter."
