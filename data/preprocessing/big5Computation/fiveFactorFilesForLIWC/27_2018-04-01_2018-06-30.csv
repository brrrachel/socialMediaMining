Left-wing howl over left-wing extremism inquiry?
Well gap press maybe.
And whether it worked. Against right and left fascism!
"Didn&#39;t devastate the booth and demolish the company ... 😄 You are uninformed, left, yes?"
Um ... daily!
Is that more your role model?
The cars always stop there. Do you also try it?
That&#39;s how it is. 😄🤦🏼♂️
Of course I mean “gap press”! I also say openly in the face of the representatives. Where do you have a problem again?
"And that was once again a prime example of cheap left-wing cheating, bravo!"
But won&#39;t it ...
Make the (new) left-wing bogus provocative and tough wherever we meet!
Even very careful! This was dealt with in detail in the anti-fascist GDR. And do you know that it was only aggressive &quot;red guards&quot; that paved the way back then? Like today the left-autonomous mob. Nothing learned from the story you red class jerk?
"Didn&#39;t say lying press, you liar."
"The reception is not so important, it has to send! 😄"
"&quot;Merkel has to go&quot; - So the #AfD&#39;s right? Interesting entry in the post. #Merkel, with its policies and the shift to the left in the country, has almost isolated Germany in Europe. Nothing learned from history !? #AfDwirkt http://www.tagesschau.de/kommentar/merkel-eu-gipfel-119.html…"
And other topics: 🔹more direct democracy 👍🏻 🔹balancing Russia 👍🏻 🔹stop energy transition 👍🏻 🔹funding daycare 👍🏻 🔹gender abolition 👍🏻 🔹 against left-wing extremism 👍🏻 🔹 against Islamization 👍🏻 etc.
"Nope, was completely freely accessible. The citizens in the village probably did not want to be left intolerant, and they could no longer cart in from outside. Failure."
"We didn&#39;t say it, THAT is the difference!"
Says a left-wing incitement !? 😂
"And you live like that the day before yesterday, right? How is that? 🤔"
"Oh, &quot;choke&quot; you? Class! Then it &quot;works&quot;! 👍🏻😄"
"We are also in the mood for Europe, so we reject the EU, which is destroying Europe."
"See how honest I am, I even mentioned that. Should be 100 ..."
"Which shop hit the wall? You mean my company that was ravaged and completely demolished by left-hand rags in October 2015, which I had closed at the end of 2016 because I was elected to the state parliament and devote myself fully to my work there without running a business?"
"I have from the citizens&#39; meeting from 13.06. written! My god are you punished with lack of intelligence, maybe left?"
Why wish? Can you read correctly? Apparently not!
"Why? If so, then the contributors!"
"Neither do I. But if it has to be, then it should be the right one!"
"If it is “inevitable,” I wrote. LRS?"
"Too Stupid to Read? I wrote: if it&#39;s &quot;inevitable&quot; ... so I don&#39;t want it and I don&#39;t hope so. Man, bissl education is not that difficult ..."
Talking about doomsday? What did you whistle in again?
"And you like that? Nazi Macke, yes?"
Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that.
"Why, surely..."
"But they were all lifted, so they were in a clean slate. Crap what? Of course, such a left-wing agitator is annoyed."
You mean the red baggage?
Quiet? I am already choosing my own time for writing.
But we shouldn&#39;t always look back and look at politics here and now. But not again? And why do victims of right-wing violence justify attacks by foreigners today?
Germany doesn&#39;t need an AfD? We saw that! 😂
Yes should your like be locked away?

"First of all, I am not rid of all positions, nor did I have to hand over one, I did it voluntarily for a good reason. Are you horny for the office that you define yourself and others about offices?"
It is about the increase in offenses that could easily have been avoided. What is wrong with the consideration?
Where did and did he “fail”? He actually has no reason to complain. Or is there envy involved?
Then you have not paid attention in the daily political events. Maybe take off the ideological bell?
Oh the phonetics now ...
In your unreal left world ... sure!
And you a stupid left-wing incitement?
&quot;Volkverhetzer&quot;? Which court should have sentenced me in this regard? Do you realize that such a defamation can be expensive?
Do you mean Communist North Korea? The paradise of the left?
"And are the victims of these attacks all just &quot;fake&quot;? The death in Wittenberg, the murdered in Berlin and elsewhere, all just fake? Maybe your mind is just fake and therefore not there at all?"
"What &quot;crime&quot; should I have committed? Request for detailed clarification, or do you only want to spread left-wing rumors?"
"What exactly, please?"
What exactly? Can&#39;t deal with the facts?
"That&#39;s right, most of the 50 protesters who were supposed to give the impression that the village was &quot;defending themselves against the AfD&quot; did not even come from the village! These were left-wing hobby demonstrators and red and green MPs. #LinkesTrauerspiel"
"That was a fact at the citizens&#39; meeting, even if it doesn&#39;t suit you."
"&quot;Colorful village festival&quot; with max. 50 people against the #AfD ...

"That the club does not meet the required neutrality obligation, but still receives tax funds."
"Do you mean the National SOCIALISTS? Must never exist again, just as little as Stalinism and Maoism."
"Minister Grimm-Benne replied to my question as to whether togetherness e. V. does not work clearly and specifically against the AfD with &quot;No&quot;. 🤦🏼‍♂️ Minister, please inform yourself in the future before you make your contributions, just read the anti-AfD contributions on their homepage."

All parties can be described as extremist. Should everyone be denied funding? How are you feeling?
Made a lop because of it ... rather hit the first peg. If only you were half as intelligent as a magpie.
"After fierce debate, the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt rejected the # AfD application, the left-wing radical association “Miteinander e. V. “to refuse further tax financing, since it clearly violates the principle of neutrality. Several members of the #CDU abstained. #NoAntifa"
Which loan please?
And you? A left-wing class pass?
He can not mob more than stupid left.
Is that always the case with you?

"The truth is only in the Taz or New Germany, right?"
Do you mean like yours with the word #Nazi?
"&quot;Little thief gang&quot;? Perceptual disorders, yes?"
"Oh? Have you never heard of the fact that we are fighting against left-wing extremism, Islamization and the EU as well as for referendums at the federal level, just for example?"
"But not, your peers can do better! Honor to whom honor is due."
You can have your extremely humble opinion.
The State Audit Office has already checked and there are already first results. Even if you don&#39;t like the fact that the AfD is really working hard again.
"Well, they can&#39;t do much more. Aggressive leftist ideology with violence and intolerance. We already had in the Weimar Republic with the Red Guards and everything that followed. Leftists are from the day before yesterday, nothing learned from history! https://jungefreiheit.de/politik/deutschland/2018/sachsen-anhalt-anschlaege-auf-afd-bueros/…"
"Thank you! Shot down again stupidly left, wonderful."
And where do you get this erroneous assumption from? 😄
I know: klar YOU clearly write the biggest nonsense!
They were already at home with me and rioted. It won&#39;t stop us.
"Well Winkelmann, probably not your own?"
"We defend the Basic Law and German values, you mean. Your left &quot;black block&quot; wants to abolish the state as well as law and law. First inform, then discuss!"
How can you be so devoured by national self-loathing? What is wrong with this left-wing chaotic group? And then these people want to impose their pathological ideology on others in an even more intolerant way. Says it all. #AfD #LinkerHass #Patriotismus https://www.welt.de/politik/article177749028/Angeblicher-Nationalismus-Linksjugend-ruft-zum-Fahnen-Klau-auf.html…
"The questions and answers are always published, don&#39;t you know?"
Oh? So is there a differentiation here? 🤔 Otherwise you always say the same undifferentiated: #Nazi !?
"I am not aware of any daily individual cases from the right. This does not mean that violent crimes do not exist from the right, but not to the extent."
"Exactly, because daily &quot;individual cases&quot; come from the right ... finally wake up ..."
"Exactly, we know from communist states, so the &quot;paradise&quot; that your peers long for. Not with us!"
The CSU is fed up with your Stalin slogans!
"But no, if you want to make dumb and violent left-wing extremists, and this was what the lecture was about, to do practical work, that&#39;s something in the middle!"
Dream on! 😂🤦🏼♂️
"What do the Greens say about the mass murders of the Armenians, or under Stalin and Mao? Not at all? Then that would be even less than the &quot;bird shit&quot; quoted, right?"
"Yes, that&#39;s extremist rags. And for my followers, no matter from which side, I can really only be held responsible to a very limited extent."
And the next ones showed that it can be done ...
The green? Could fit.
"No, it&#39;s not mine. I have described violent left-wing extremist students as &quot;left-wing extremists&quot; - and I will stick to it."
"It is very simple: we are for a peaceful Europe of the fatherland and not for a central EU. Quite simple, isn&#39;t it?"
"So far, but since the AfD is not right-wing extremist but at most right-wing populist, it can and must become even more powerful."
"For example, patriotism created American independence, what was wrong with it?"
Roth # Greens should finally learn the difference between #Patriotism and #Nationalism! The #AfD stands clearly for its own identity and the cooperation of the nations at eye level - not for exaggerating one&#39;s own and demeaning the other. https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/wm-2018/article177682730/Fussball-WM-2018-Gruene-Roth-forder-Zurueckhaltung-mit-nationaler-Selbstbeweihraeucherung.html…
"Unlike your peers, I can do it without droning."
"Sure, after all, we are forced to deal with the left wing and individual cases, so we know about it."
"Yes yes, that&#39;s been told for 5 years. We&#39;ll move into the federal states of Bavaria and Hesse while you gossip on the left. 😄"
"You are only half informed again. Half knowledge but full agitation. Typically left. The AfD, for example, is committed to strengthening volunteering, there is nothing to do with asylum policy. Or against left-wing extremism, has nothing to do with asylum policy."
"What nonsense are you telling again ... 🤦🏼‍♂️ There is always AfD to choose somewhere, because there is always a mayor election or something."
"More and more stabbing in Germany. Even if it is evidently mostly foreign perpetrators, none of this has anything to do with the multi-cultural experiment - try to convince us link ideologues. #AfD #NoMultiKulti http://m.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/Messerangriff-in-Hannover-Oststadt-Frau-stirbt-Taeter-auf-der-Flucht…"
The AfD is center-right! We largely represent claims of a CDU from 10 to 20 years ago. As Merkel once said: Multi-Kulti failed terribly? So: choose AfD today!

Reality is the strength of the AfD!
"The AfD is an omnipotent party, nice that you also notice it."
"Nothing at first, why?"
Like the constant left fight against revenge?
"Well, fascists always find a reason to exclude themselves."
"Again, this contradicts the left-wing theory that everything was already there, was caused by Germans in the same way, and there was no serious increase in crime by foreigners. Tunnel view through link ideology - that&#39;s what I call it. #AfD #NoMultiKulti https://jungefreiheit.de/politik/deutschland/2018/anklage-wirft-roma-diebesbande-rekord-einbruchsserie-vor/…"
"Maybe tens of millions, maybe a few million. What is your problem?"
# AfD parliamentary group in the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt has just set up a &quot;parliamentary committee of inquiry&quot; on the subject of misconduct by the waste water treatment associations.

"You mean like the N in the SPD, CDU and NPD? Great view ..."
Are you too stupid to replicate your own question?
It has been done long enough from a different perspective.
"Verbally in the Bundestag, of course, that&#39;s what the wording was about."
We do not have to tolerate a religion that is clearly directed against our GG.
"I do not know exactly, they would be able to trust them."
We do not throw things together but show the unsightly connections!
But of course! And do you know what also led to it? The violent red mob on the streets.
"No not at all, we are also clearly against violence."
"That&#39;s how it is with the left tunnel view, you don&#39;t see much anymore ..."
&quot;Greatest potential hazard that has ever been found in Europe&quot; - but that cannot be!

"Not mixing everything does not mean just taking care of yourself. Ever heard of constructive partnership? Do not you know? Left, yes?"
"Yes, in Germany!"
So then exclude all nations that use their flags like this? Or does that only apply to Germans? Then you would be racist in your opinion. So how now?
"Who can get advice from a left-wing persistent agitator? 😂🤦🏼‍♂️ And your red-based comrades are rather thwarted, right?"
"What is disparaging about the trades caraway and camel driver? And then on Ash Wednesday? And which nation should I belittle? Bissl mess, yes?"
"They are just plain stupid as it seems. Your peers first conjure up the situation of 1st and 2nd class people because you need the everlasting image of fascism in your left delusion, otherwise nobody would need you anymore!"
The fire is caused by intolerant and anti-German agitators like you!
"Well then that would also apply to almost all other countries. According to your left-wry understanding, all would be &quot;nationalistic&quot; ... French, Poles, Russians anyway ... USA etc."
"Yes, I even write my speeches myself and know very well what I am saying. It is patriotic and not nationalistic."
"If extremely negative changes occur, which of course deny your peers, then you must and must clearly and clearly name them! That is justified criticism and not agitation."
"Yes, just ask who! 😂"
Who said &quot;caraway Turks&quot;?
And did you dream like that again?
"For example direct democracy and referendums at federal level or exit from the EU. Well, ring the bell?"
"When the force of multi-cultural at any price hits their own family, many citizens finally wake up. Sexual assaults on women or a brutalized environment for their own children, then acceptance of the left-wing spook ends. #AfD #NoMultiKulti https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/plus177623406/Einschulung-Liebe-zu-Multikulti-endet-oft-mit-der-Schulpflicht-der-Kinder.html…"
Nobody likes to dispute that. But wasn&#39;t there an attack from the east too? And is a war of aggression against a neighboring state sufficient for World War II?
"Please no envy, it always looks so cheap-left ..."

Oh? Read the book?

So if you have to break it ... Everything done right! #AfDwirkt
"Then, according to your dubious theory, the completely left-wing countries should rather join the communist North Korea, right? First think, otherwise it will always be left nonsense ..."
... which would then of course include the abolition of the black block and the violent street mob on the left ... surely you mean.
We are already a role model politically! 24.3% and 15 direct mandates for the #AfD in the state election.
Just looking in the mirror?
"But not leftists or others? Stalinism, Maoism, Communism, Imperialism, etc.? Form a little more, then it will work!"
We&#39;ve been doing it for a long time! Not paying attention again? I only say: No to Russian sanctions! The damage to the economy in SA is immense.
You have no idea what &quot;ethnic nationalism&quot; is! Again just unskilled.
Just think! It is all about the EU&#39;s external borders. Only if they “work” can there be boundlessness within the EU.
"The #CSU really tried the uprising. #Merkel has to go, that&#39;s for sure. However, I only suspect a little Kraftmeierei for election campaign purposes, after all, the state parliament election is just around the corner in Bavaria. Ultimately only helps: #AfD!"
"You mean the arrest warrants, all of which have been suspended? Don&#39;t you have more to rush?"
"If the 1020 so-called propaganda offenses (the swastika at the bus stop) are subtracted, then there is no big difference between left and right!"
Then leftists are also bird-free because of communist demands?
And what happens if we just let it go with left-wing extremism? Stalinism again or Maoism with tens of millions dead? No thanks!
"Well, of course not yours ..."
"But I was never bankrupt, what now? Again left-stupid agitation? 🤔"
"Not correct! Last VS report: right-motivated offenses declining, left-motivated offenses 41% increase! Again 0 plan of matter, right?"
Of course! #Rechtsstaatspartei
So do you have more information than the VS? Or do you just have 0 plan of what you&#39;re talking about?
Extremely cheap. Left?
But not ...

What didn&#39;t you understand? Can I help you?
"Not at all, it wasn&#39;t against the AfD. I find it good."
"But no, it wasn&#39;t geared towards the AfD."
"#Merkel in Anne Will: &quot;Loyalty is first of all to your own country&quot; - that&#39;s right, but why don&#39;t you stick to it? Then why do you want to dissolve Germany in a limitless EU-wide range? #AfDeffects #NoEU"
"Police call 110: almost thought, you want to raise your moral finger again with the flower against the #AfD, instead it is all about violent and blunt right-wing extremists."
Are you now talking about the many kindled asylum homes by your own workforce?

Otherwise you would probably also be able to do something with it?

Of course it is. One can also call Stalinists Stalinists.

"Do it already, let it go. 😂"
"But doesn&#39;t that apply to the left? Can&#39;t end in Stalinism and Maoism with tens of millions of deaths, no?"
&quot;Suction.&quot; Good man!
"Yes, that&#39;s the &quot;right-wing populists&quot;, another difference to the other side."
They mean like the left in asylum home fires. Are they then no longer allowed to complain and scold &quot;right&quot;? Or is that something else?
"You are here on my site, if you do please go away."
"Quite simply: nothing! Do not infer yourself from others. Have you been bullied before, yes?"
"But after all, you don&#39;t have anything at all. Well, except for &quot;sausage&quot; in any context."

But we have. You just don&#39;t like our solutions.
"Well, in Saxony-Anhalt we had at least 24.3% with me as chairman and top candidate."
Everyone on his side can allow or block what he wants. That does not deprive your peers of the right to express themselves openly on their own side. As far as understood?
"The court used the same “concept of values” as with others. After all, there were bizarre Ash Wednesday speeches outside of the AfD. But of course you want a different yardstick to be set for the AfD, right?"
"Do you do that with your peers, by prescribing? We are more of a self-thinker."
"I don&#39;t have a nationalist mark, maybe a national one. Form more instead of imagination!"
"This can certainly be the case with Nazis and Communists, but I don&#39;t let humor take my mind."
Do not know any anti-democratic opinion in the AfD.
"Oh yes, do it. The court also emphasized the context of Ash Wednesday and that has been legitimate for decades. Why should the AfD be different now?"
"You mean illegal immigrants? Of course, they can also say your opinion. Does the AfD claim otherwise?"
Did I block you? So what! Flap shut and unroll.
"Are you new? Then you learned something about it. Suction. Refugees are the same? Yes, but sometimes even the same, see multiple marriage, marriage with minors, etc."
"Camel driver = cow boy = job without further evaluation. What is your problem? Your own left me, yes?"
The more eager the more primitive?
Exactly what I said! Intolerant people just have to learn what freedom of expression is. It cannot be that this should only apply to criticism and defamation “against the right”. Law and law are the same for everyone! #AfD # freedom of expression http://m.dnn.de/Region/Umland/Staatsanwaltschaft-stell-Ermittlungen- Gegen-Poggenburg-ein…
"Of course, as chairman of a left-wing extremism inquiry."
"The Germans did it this way and marginalized dissenters instead of seeking open discourse! This is exactly why these twelve years came about and you didn&#39;t learn anything from them, but repeated everything, only with slightly different omens."
Because a left spinner wants that? 😂🤦🏼♂️
"Funny if you devalue the Nazi era, it&#39;s not a good thing. Would you rather upgrade them?"
Those who constantly trivialize National Socialism by constantly referring to political opponents as Nazis spit on the victims here. Your peers should be ashamed of it!

That is your extremely humble opinion and interpretation. The &quot;left hitchhiker&quot; hitchhiked through the galaxy. &quot;It would be embarrassing for the tens of genders too!&quot;
"Of course, women have to earn the same as men for exactly the same job. The AfD never said otherwise. Let these awkward attempts get stuck ..."
"Right, find your pickers completely mindless ..."
"You can&#39;t argue here without your razor, can you? 👎🏻😂"
But you didn&#39;t pay attention in history! 😂 We even had 2 German nation states during this &quot;peacetime&quot;. The end of nationalization is still young and we are at war in Europe!
Where and when did I &quot;court&quot; the Lega? Tell me exactly.
Then maybe you didn&#39;t quite understand it !?
I had my history lessons in a real anti-fascist state! So I can clearly differentiate real anti-fascism from today&#39;s intolerant leftist ideology.
That would be something. But can they &quot;work&quot;?
And you like that?
"But they wouldn&#39;t do you any harm either, would they? But that&#39;s not what it was about now."
How do you come up with this claim?
And you think that the hordes of left-winged people are brought to the judge as well?
"That&#39;s how it is. With a &quot;right&quot;, the turtleneck pulled up is sufficient, while the chaots from the &quot;left&quot; black block are constantly rioting fully covered or a burqa would of course also have been permitted.

"Why deport? You can also reflect and do something bad, including a false belief."
"Islam can happily exist in its home countries, it doesn&#39;t belong here."
Then they should complain to the Americans and not to the Central Europeans!
Let us know! You should know it.
And you a Stalin ass?
"Don&#39;t have a problem with my life, don&#39;t make conclusions about yourself!"
"Quite simply, roared, mobbed, asked to leave several times, made no move ..."
"True, pretend to be listeners and are then just bawling left-wing interferers, the mask always falls in the end."
"Yes, but not a roaring disturbance of speeches."
"Quite simply, this woman and other left-wing Groöler were asked to leave the event several times, but she only did so when stepped in as a folder."
"Well, let&#39;s not say AfD critics, but outrageous vocal troublemakers, who would have blown out the same way at any other event."
Right
"I have never been unemployed, failed, bankruptcy, bankrupt or anything else, so sorry for your view of the world. Your left-wing chaotic and work-shy buddies rather fit into the scheme!"
"Again: I was not arrested, everything was stopped. Now get it?"
Then why did you start in a completely different way?
"No trial was even opened, it was all nonsense. And what is this constant stupid demand here? What do you want please"
"Islam does not belong to Germany and Europe. Islam can be lived in its countries of origin, it has lost nothing here and only brings problems and sacrifices."
"It did very well, just switch your mind and admit connections."
My god ... I didn&#39;t write about Capone.
What exactly is your problem right now? Except lack of decency?
1. What does this have to do with each other? 2. Who wanted to &quot;denounce&quot; which teacher because of what?
So the lawyer at Stern-TV also had no idea? Or maybe YOU are just the would-be clever ...? 😂

I prefer to paint blue.
"Of course, one can and must draw conclusions if serious crimes are committed by people of a certain group to prevent and possibly prevent further victims."
"Oh, so the media are making up these terrible cases?"
"Oh? In the case of “right”, however, there is also a generalized and standardized approach immediately, since it is not just the individual that is considered. But that&#39;s something else, isn&#39;t it?"
We ourselves have many members with a migration background in the AfD. We are concerned with deporting highly criminal immigrants and refusing to let new ones in at all.

"The district court of Gießen has not found that the AfD is right-wing. First of all, inform bissl or do you think that this left nonsense gets caught in normal thinking people?"

"Your red thinking is more in the past, the day before yesterday!"
#ZDF &quot;Aspects&quot; speaks of a new &quot;neo-fascist&quot; government in Italy and lets Friedmann speak of &quot;cancer enemy&quot;. This is again irresponsible opinion making of public television! How can you be so ideologically left-ideological?
"Again: it was not about criticism, but about massive disruption to the event. And no, we do not accuse Muslims of exercising their house rights. We accuse stabbing and sexual assault."
"1. If it was not about criticism but about disruption, maybe you will learn at some point that this is two-fold. 2. How should a security guard &quot;touch&quot; a person who resists to lead them out if not by the arm?"
It was not about the &quot;Nazis&quot; as people but the #Nazi categorization.
"Then what should I do with the abundance? As a Maoist or Stalinist, don&#39;t you need a little bit of it?"

"You can only be left blinded. 🤦🏼‍♂️ As a man you are born, you can choose your religion, with all the trimmings. Therefore, the box is completely meaningless."

"Where was the origin of the perpetrator here, please? It was about the deed (s)! Can you only think in very small niches?"
"Well, who is doing himself badly there?"
"You are wrong. Unfortunately, on the left side, much less effort is usually put into identifying people."
"Fake, of course. It&#39;s not even the AfD logo on it. Incidentally, Stalin would rather vote for EU fans, because he also liked a large empire with a central government."
"I did not write about AfD initiatives, but that there have been and there are tens of initiatives in this direction. We create the balance, that&#39;s always good. In addition, there was our initiative &quot;no protests in front of the asylum homes&quot; in SA, which was very effective!"
The often violent attempt to eliminate our FDGO.
Do you also make a contribution for other parties? Where do you want to &quot;punch in the face&quot; or &quot;let Germany die&quot; etc.? We are all very excited!
"Right, and further?"
The &quot;extremism&quot;.
"The #AfD stands against left-wing, right-wing and religiously motivated extremism alike! In addition to countless initiatives against right-wing extremism, left-wing extremism must now also be targeted. #AfDeffkt #GegenExtremismus pic.twitter.com/fzh1lCk0A5"
The tragic incident a quarter of a century ago? Are you alluding to it now?
That you&#39;re making yourself so bad ... all respect.
"You don&#39;t need to “interpret” them, just read and understand them."
Complete nonsense! Only left-wing extremists are left-wing extremists and luckily that&#39;s not everyone who has nothing to do with the AfD.
"Mao-fan, mood?"
And further please?
"I don&#39;t know who “Kümmeltürke” is from. Camel driver came from me, I don&#39;t think it was bad, was satire, means &quot;cow boy&quot; in D ... so what? Counter-demo is completely acceptable, the verbal agitation and moral intolerant fluff just embarrassing left."
Then ask your question again.

"Exactly ... this is how the left side deals with answering questions and problems. &quot;Hitchhiking through the galaxy&quot;, that fits the left (un) mind that is far from reality."
But that could somehow excuse every &quot;mass phenomenon&quot; !?
Rejection? Then that could hardly have happened.
Completely wrong again! We even fight against it because we are against violence.
"Yes, right, true diversity of nations will win instead of the multi-cultural unity!"
Who&#39;s nervous? 🤔
"Young world and new Germany, yes?"
"Sure, they are against everything &quot;German&quot;."
And who continuously downplayed National Socialism is pitiful and is not taken seriously by anyone.
You are the only howler here! 😄🤦🏼♂️
"I did not say that, learn to read and understand! I wrote &quot;Get inspiration&quot;."
"Nope ... just as little as Islam, Nafris &amp; Co ..."
"And what are you doing on my site? No own virtual home? Nobody wants you, right?"
Read and understand “Get your suggestion”!
"Criticism of the association &quot;Turkish Community&quot; has nothing to do with racist or undemocratic, the judiciary also sees. Learned something again?"
"The left-wing riot idiots are more agitated and relaxed, I have no problem with relaxation."
"Since I have no racist and undemocratic statements, I cannot explain them either."
"1. Where did I write about a specific accusation of racism? 2. No, criticism of Islam is not racist."
Which flop please?
Left baggage as you know it.
"Because of a left-wing incitement, should I &quot;come down&quot;? 😂"
Where did I write we were a race?
The well-known top level!
"You just didn&#39;t get it yourself, did you? It is funny that even the left baggage with the umpteen gender options in the debate was a bit embarrassing and you wanted to &quot;hitchhike back through the galaxy&quot; ... 😂"
"&quot;Reality perception restricted&quot; !? And from a left-wing incitement, delicious! 😄"
"May be, is similar with the Kommis. I don&#39;t like both."
Please have a look at the plenary recordings on the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag page.
"Well, but never gave an arrest, never bankruptcy or bankruptcy. Strange everything, isn&#39;t it? 😏"
"I definitely don&#39;t, but you did come up with it."
"Against agitation with stupid agitation? 😂 And me like that? Um, I&#39;m on my side here because ... it&#39;s my side !? 🤔"
Ahsooo ... there are even an infinite number of genders and the AfDers are supposedly too stupid to understand this as a reality ... of course! Underlines my posts so wonderfully. 😄
It is as easy to understand as to embarrass the fact that the left in the debate rattled several times about tens of genders.
"Disgraceful is more like rowing back &quot;Hitchhiking through the galaxy&quot;, because it is probably too embarrassing with the tens of genders !?"
"Rowing back &quot;Hitchhiking through the galaxy&quot; is already tried by others, because it is probably too embarrassing with the tens of genders !?"
Backups? For what please ... 😄
Armed with how many genders? Hopefully not the 18th?
So only one is crying right now - you!
"Yes, we laughed vigorously in the plenum ..."
"I do not post &quot;it&quot; again and again, but I post new attacks every time! Then no isolated cases !?"
The AfD is clearly center-right.
And Stalinists and Maoists and their brothers in spirit: the left-wing extremists!
Oh? Then why are some people so upset about my Ash Wednesday speech? 🤔
I am in the east ... 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
Left would-be know-it-all?
Are these crimes not an important issue?
I never do that. But I do that and repeat with those who themselves call everything and everyone a Nazi or the like.
And further in the series #Individual case The bad: the poor victims of the constant assaults The only good: the Germans inevitably wake up more from the multi-cultural (Alb) dream every day and recognize the reality. #AfD #NoMultiKulti 🇩🇪 https://m.bild.de/regional/chemnitz/vergewaltigung/syrer-vergewaltigt-maedchen-in-chemnitz-55825510.bildMobile.html?wtmc=whtspp.shr…

But when I speak of the individual case !? Left would-be smart ...?
What do you do to my parents? Left spinner?

"It is remarkable how often such acts occur that they don&#39;t even get upset, right?"
And you are trivializing National Socialism again? Pathetic!
"I didn&#39;t write anywhere, so keep the ball flat."
"The AfD is not racist, we evaluate based on deeds, statements and voluntary affiliations."
"And the Kristinchen is stupid, as always?"
"You &quot;see through&quot; or don&#39;t understand the AfD, right? 🤔"
"Well then, the rejection of an Islam that is contrary to constitutional law has nothing to do with racism ... it is still being claimed."
😂 But please please ... no procedure has ever been opened. But you can show everyone.

Are you still dreaming?
"Of course, that could help."
Who says that? Another “survey”?

"Locking out and locking up is not the same thing, first of all, and besides, I never did."
What does imprisonment have to do with blocking on a separate page? You can explain that to us. Apart from the fact that I was also preventively blocked on countless pages on which I had never written anything before.
"No trial has even been opened! Why, because there is nothing. But you can always show first."
So I don&#39;t follow anyone to unload any effusions on their pages.

"Because the BZ read completely wrong, should the AfD be desperate? 😂🤦🏼♂️"
Would be happy if it was actually just a joke! That with the umpteen possible genders is unfortunately sad left-degenerate ideology and not a joke.
"But he had, in his interjection. But there were probably 41 ..."
And the ladder ...
"Justified criticism is baiting for you? Then soon no one will be allowed to criticize anything that contradicts your alien ideology, right?"
Old and half-true ... bills were paid in full with interest and fees upon presentation of the official request. Any left gossip?
As well.
Fortunately.
"The @bzberlin with strong reading disabilities? Where did I write that Striegel had 42 genders? Hiding Striegel&#39;s answer behind &quot;irony&quot; does not catch on, since in fact several left-wing MPs from umpteen possible genders rattled. #NetterVersuch 😂 https://www.bz-berlin.de/deutschland/42-so-blamierte-sich-afd-mann-poggenburg-auf-twitter…"
I will not. And can continue to punish any left-wing accusation.
"Growth of 41% according to the latest VS report is irrelevant? Is it just #link extremism, the “good extremism”, is it not? 🤦🏼♂️"
Already the first word.
&quot;Reality distortion&quot; - and this reproach from a totally left anointed ... is that delicious ... 😂
"You just don&#39;t get it? Book quotation or attempted joke - no matter, the left MPs were serious about the umpteen possible sexes and therefore the question in my contribution is justified."
For example?
"Wrong, I think diversity is better than multi-cultural uniforms and I never said lying press. Anything else stupid?"
So the picture contribution is not correct? Then illuminate us with more detailed information.
Didn&#39;t you pay for your bockwurst?
"If it were ironic and the left block did not really come up with the theory that there were several tens of genders during the whole discussion, you could actually laugh."
What did Mr. Striegel mean by the first 41 and then 42 sexes?
Choose so that the constant left shift comes to an end.
"Unfortunately, it is not a single case."
"Not true, but now on?"
And then does this clarify the debate among several left-wing MPs about umpteen possible genders?
And what about the 41 genders mentioned above? Delicious too?
When I&#39;m supposed to have read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;? Make a decision at last.
"No, why should I."
Well then stick to it and close your head!
"Oh, just because there&#39;s something to read somewhere, is it the truth?"
The 42 sexes? You have to ask Striegel.
So how do you have no idea of manners?
"Striegel # Greens spoke today during an interjection in the plenum of 42 possible genders! I wonder, is there any way to stop the left mental decline of our society? #AfDeffects #NoGender"
Then you are playing down National Socialism enormously. Shame yourself!
"Neither, even if you don&#39;t like it."
He was just writing ... You didn&#39;t &quot;speak&quot;.
Neither ...
"You know what you&#39;re talking about, right?"
Yes and now?
What has that got to do with the left theory of supposedly umpteen gender options?
"Doesn&#39;t hurt at all, but you seem to know that?"
"Couldn&#39;t there be more exaggeration?

Profileless politics? Like the previous ones of the old parties?
"That is your humble opinion, you can have. And what do you always want here on my site?"
"Well, it would be a measure."
"Right-wing populist, not everyone likes it, but completely legitimate."
The only whine you are right now!
"You see, and I have as little to do with Nazi, fascist or anything like that."
"Yes, with laughter at your kindergarten pickers. 😂"
Why should I be &quot;ashamed&quot; of the left gender theory of tens of genders?
"Oh so ... now the statement with the umpteen genders is not just &quot;irony&quot;, but exactly the gender nonsense that I addressed. Thanks for the clarification!"
"Trash literature is literature too, isn&#39;t it?"

"We clearly &quot;understand&quot; that. There are no other arguments on the left. Nevertheless, the question: should we constantly swing the Communist club?"
And I didn&#39;t even say caraway Turk! But I don&#39;t understand the NS jargon either.
Headwind? We have no problem. But are you justifying massive damage to property by left-wing parties against politically dissenting people?
"If knife knives are called knife men, what is wrong or racist about it? 🤔"
"Right, always the same lyre with the Nazi owl."
"We are not &quot;xenophobic&quot;, we don&#39;t harm a stranger. However, we are critical of illegal mass immigration, which is our right."
Lippmann #Linke accuses the #AfD of plenary methods in the 3rd Reich. Leftists are forever caught in the day before yesterday. The Nazi club is swinging as ever. Should we also accuse the left-wing league of Stalinism and Maoism? #AfDwirkt
"What I clearly deny! Just because you don&#39;t like our solutions, they still exist."
"We always speak out against violence, &quot;riot&quot; is more the species from the left wing!"
"Left letter to the editor or blog, yes? 😂"
"How do you come up with such nonsense? Where do we want to deny the aforementioned groups social justice? If, for example, we demand an adequate pension, this applies to women, gays, etc. exactly as well! Why are you trying to exclude here?"
"Well, for example, that someone who has had a hard, long working life can actually make a good living from his pension!"
This should not apply to illegal immigrants who also act like invaders instead of guests.

"And we don&#39;t want to let it get that far, so stand up against left-wing extremism now! Incidentally, I had already “left-wing visitors”, the company and private house completely devastated, cowardly gang."

"Oh, I like that. 😄 But thanks anyway."
"Right. Against violent left, right and religious extremism."

Of course you can ...

Why this? Because we from the AfD are always calling for violence everywhere? What is &quot;strange&quot; there?
"The only question was whether such a title is relevant under criminal law, nothing more. No one has determined whether or that the AfD is extremist. One could also say that the Greens, Leftists, SPD, etc. are extremists. Do you understand that at all?"
But no. That&#39;s not what the post was about.
Which court or authority ever found that out? Are you doing this for us now? 😂
"From which court has Mr. Höcke been classified as a racist or extremist? Or are you talking about left-wing, subjective opinion? 🤔"
So you have no argument? I thought to myself...
Which district court has classified the AfD as extremist? Now we&#39;re all excited! Hope the VS is reading along as someone is trying to do their homework.
Consensus in the red bunch of left-wing fascists? 😂
Look up the definition of racism in the Duden and explain to me exactly where and how the AfD is racist ...
"But not ... firstly I just asked politely, not insulted at all, they do the same. And secondly, the left-hand spinners make “lists”, because they are also going around a Böhmermann list ..."

Have you just described yourself?
"Clear language like &quot;Ätschi&quot; from Nahles? 😄 Of course, financially &quot;drain&quot;, that goes without saying."
Why should it and what is this comment about?
Expose left-wing extremist networks and dry them up. Increase the political and legal pressure on the perpetrators.
"Especially &quot;Sudeten German Day 2018&quot; in Augsburg - the #AfD was not admitted because: neither left nor right-wing extremists are allowed to participate, says spokesman Posselt from the #CSU! I would never have believed Bavaria to have that much joke in a statement. 😂☝🏻 #AfDeffects #Landagswahl"
"They shoot themselves so wonderfully here, election campaign for the AfD!"
Even less success than the left trollos? It doesn&#39;t work!
We at the AfD are always wide awake. And you?
But you are the agitator here! Your comment has clearly shown that this has long been understood by almost everyone.
"No trial has ever been opened against me! You can “show” everyone first - cheap, ie left, stitch. 😂☝🏻🤦🏼♂️"
To left trolls &amp; reporting pussies here: You can “report” my posts hundreds more times because they don&#39;t suit you and you are completely intolerant - nevertheless there are no violations to be found! You make yourself really ridiculous again ... #AfDwirkt 🇩🇪 pic.twitter.com/PFf5JjIEsp
"We know the numbers ourselves and know very well how these statistics come about. And burning police vehicles, occupied houses, violence against AfDler and supporters, massively damaged real estate of political dissenters are just not quite real."
You can rely on it! 😉
It is also a danger to our free constitutional state. But a very widespread &quot;plague&quot; is left-wing extremism.
"Are we violently acting behind closed doors against politically dissenting people, like the left-wing Shots do? I strongly disagree with that."
"I? For now, stick to the &quot;you&quot; as it should be."
"This is exactly what we are working on in the left-wing extremism committee of our state parliament, whose chair I am allowed to be. We&#39;ll do it. 😉"
"No, you were completely wrong, as I am sure so often, because I meant left-wing extremist clubs and networks. The left baggage is more effective against private individuals."
Likewise...
Just you left-wing howling buoy are just humorless. 😂
"# Left-wing extremism - political plague of our time!

"Perpetrator of what act? I don&#39;t know of any, tell me."
"Exactly, the statistics come about because of so-called &quot;propaganda offenses&quot;. Politically motivated violence looks very different."
And how do you define “hate”? And does your definition also apply to your left-wing cronies?
"By hate do you mean leftist acts of violence, such as break-ins, devastation, destruction or even attacks on politically different people by left-wing chaots?"
The Nierths from # Tröglitz are to be awarded. For what please? Because they have been wallowing in victimhood since 2015? Because BM Nierth received strong criticism from the residents for its welcoming culture? Because the Nierths are undemocratic against the #AfD? #NoMultiKulti
"Right! “Too much” is therefore not easily digestible, not even with vitamin C. So that has nothing to do with the term “digestible”."
They had previously written a personal insult comment. So stay nice and factual and close to the truth!
"The experience of the last decades of Europe&#39;s sovereign states is enough evidence. On the other hand, where do you get the certainty that this EU experiment is not causing more conflict than is already the case?"
Then the consumer should perhaps associate something less (wrongly) but think for himself.
"But we spoke of peaceful Europe - and according to your graphic, Europe has been &quot;peaceful&quot; with sovereign fatherlands most of the past decades."
Why please? Everything that is exaggerated is no longer healthy at some point. At the moment this has nothing to do with &quot;digestible&quot; or not at all.
"These are the topics that the EU and the BGH deal with, beautifully senseless, typically left."
"#BGH judges: Beer must not be advertised as &quot;digestible&quot; and thus bends against a corresponding # EU regulation. Another example of EU delusion and citizens&#39; spoilage. Away with this rule and bureaucracy monster, towards a peaceful Europe of the fatherlands! #AfD #NoEU"
Oh? When and how did Iran bomb the Golan Heights? 🤔
"But why? These &quot;advertisements&quot; go away regularly, not even a procedure is opened."
"Don&#39;t worry, for me the left baggage has already devastated the company and the apartment. I don&#39;t let people like that “scare me away”."
Definitely ... 🤦🏼‍♂️
"Currently trial in the Federal Constitutional Court: lawsuits against unjust broadcasting fees. The #AfD wishes the plaintiffs success, because fees that are levied like taxes to finance luxury wages for broadcasting superiors are clearly ripped off! #AfDeffects #NoGEZ"
Because you want left troll? 😂
"Opposition leaders, i.e. AfD, traditionally started in this particular debate."
"But it&#39;s not about the dry alcoholic. The term &quot;digestible&quot; would not matter at all in advertising, would it?"
You surely mean Islamic terror and violent left-wing extremism.
"#Merkel repeats mantra-like and still completely wrong, especially in the Bundestag: &quot;Germany&#39;s freedom is also defended in the Hindu Kush&quot;. Such theses can be used to justify any war of aggression by a “defense army” anywhere in the world! #AfD #Merkelmussweg"
#Merkel speaks in the Bundestag of Iran bombing the Golan Heights !? 🤔 I think a slip of the tongue and it should be called Israel ...
#Hofreiter (Greens) again gives the screamer and left-handers in the German Bundestag at Alice Weidel&#39;s speech #AfD. Since it probably hit the bull&#39;s eye or green. 🇩🇪👏🏻
"In the GG there is also &quot;The German people&quot;, which is diametrically opposed to your statement. You have a problem with our basic law!"
Then you are also against the Basic Law?
"Unreal communists keep trying to build up the fine image of Nazi to justify their existence and live out their moral arrogance. Her role models, Stalin, Mao &amp; Co., have millions more people on their consciences than the National Socialists."

Then live your life instead of rolling around here on the left.
"Yes, maybe it works with a reasonably meaningful comment from you, without a left-hand twist and insinuations."
Oh? 😄 Who says that?
"Completely wrong, like most of the time."
Yes and? Center-right by the way.
"Debate about Özil &amp; Gündogan&#39;s appearance with Erdogan is hypocritical! It is not about “good or bad”, but about fundamental questions: Who is actually German? Who belongs to the national team? When will dual citizenship be abolished? #AfD #NoMultiKulti"
"You are talking about violent and sexual crime, which is extremely disproportionate among so-called refugees, right? I&#39;m sorry, but that confirms us again."
I am a politician because I was elected by many people! And we understand that you cannot bring mosques and Islamism together. Leftist ideology blinds to free realism.
Our criticism of multi-cultural at any price is very specific and less general.
"And who determines the “dignity of the mandate”, you? 😄"
"Oh, do you mean like the left-wing fools who want to defame anyone who doesn&#39;t applaud illegal mass immigration as a #Nazi and thus play down National Socialism? 🤔"
A politician who replies as he is written by some left-wing riots? Long overdue! And as if you understand something about the &quot;mission&quot; of a politician !? 😂
Is your extremely humble opinion and sees the VS differently.
"But I didn&#39;t take an oath of disclosure and was never bankrupt or bankrupt - even despite leftist attacks and destruction. So pretty successful, right?"
Don&#39;t always infer yourself from others!
"But yes, and further?"
"It was not healthy, but digestible. And what is “indestructible” about a beer?"
So there is the people and Habeck is completely wrong again?
"Oh? How and how does the AfD allegedly fight the GG? We are all very excited, facts please."
"Ruchtig, but of course people can be judged by their deeds or misdeeds. Incidentally, according to Art. 3 GG, even the real Nazi should not be disadvantaged, right?"
"Of course, Multi-Kulti has something to do with left-wing ideology."
Well that was a really classy and undemocratic left comment.
"You&#39;re probably talking about left-wing chaotic and anarcho meetings, right? And beer is a dangerous drug? Then, in your opinion, that should be prohibited, right?"
Nice fake statistics! 😄🤦🏼‍♂️ As if we just have peace in Europe. We probably had peace until 10 years ago.
"But you are not yet of legal age and maturity, are you? 🤔"
Oh ... no war in Ukraine? No politically heated Europe with Nazi accusations in Greece against Germany? And why must the consumer be protected from a bottle of beer? 😂
&quot;Abuse&quot; - you answered the matter yourself. Nobody says abuse is wholesome.
"So I had a well-running company that even enabled me to buy a manor, but unfortunately it was demolished in 2015 by left-wing extremists. Do you happen to know the criminals?"
"It always depends on the measure! In the case of excess, (almost) everything is unfit for digest, then you shouldn&#39;t advertise with anything anymore. Is that the point of the matter?"
"Ahaaa, he didn&#39;t mean it that way ... Strangely, that&#39;s not an excuse for others."
"Yes, just, &quot;The German people ...&quot; is there. You also have to understand after reading, otherwise it won&#39;t work. Bissl left-stupid, yes?"
"That&#39;s probably true, because I&#39;m not going to go that far! It already fails terribly on Article 1 of the Basic Law, so I understand that you like it."
Rather the total door and gate opening in Europe for Islam and its excesses! Who knows in which mosque he trusted the perpetrator was indoctrinated.
"If you artificially demand pity, but if you deliberately omit the expression of condolence in the post, then this is either cheap mood-raising or you are actually too stupid to read + understand."
"Well, the constant terrible events and # individual cases rather confirm our statements and not the statements of their kind."
"And what about Stalinists, Maoists and communists in general? After all, they still have a few million more consciences than the Nazis. What do you mean? 🤔"
Then read through the article again very slowly and completely. 😉
But of course you have a clear idea of it and can even divide people up? Not overbearing?
Isn&#39;t he talking about a blood price to pay? What is it to be paid for? Perhaps for the senseless multi-cultural experiment?
"If, as a clearly left-ideological person, the post is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, then it was a direct hit! And in terms of “one-sided view”, you and your kind are pioneers."
"And why now &quot;NoAfD&quot;? Aren&#39;t you contradicting yourself? So the AfD should go because it addresses the unpleasant truths, yes?"
"Not correct! You and our peers do not like our approaches, so they are negated. You can do it, but it&#39;s cheap and unbelievable."
"&quot;Wholesome&quot; merely suggests that it does not cause heartburn, does not put extra strain on the digestion and may even taste better - no more and no less."
"First of all &quot;you&quot; please, secondly I did not say what I drink, but what the EU prescribes. Nice if you find that a little stupid yourself."
"A beer as the most dangerous drug? I&#39;m not a big beer fan, but this is where you write garbage. 😂"
"First, &quot;digestible&quot; is not &quot;very healthy&quot;, second, a piece of chocolate is not necessarily unhealthy."
Very funny! People&#39;s fear has long been there and is more than justified. No more pushing around helps.
"Well, of course, left Spritis are not satisfied with a beer, of course. 😄"
"Right, &quot;it is enough&quot;! With left ideology the death toll and artificial cheaper outrage if you criticize this!"
"But does the VS see differently, and now?"
Again: Then #Macron was wrong with his statement or the press reported wrongly?
"Through “relationships” !? Which one? 😄 Oh, the truth is always turned left as it pleases, yes? Now that must have been an act of a crazy individual, otherwise it could contradict your worldview. 🤦🏼♂️"
"Colonialism was not multi-cultural! What are you telling? Today it is tried to cook everything in one pot regardless of origin, mentality, identity, tradition and religion. This is easily predictable for normal thinking people, a highly explosive mixture!"
"Oh you mean, because the IS claims the deed for itself, there can be no group behind it !? 🤔 Please explain this goodwill thinking to us."
I have none myself! ☝🏻 But your artificial criticism here is just left-wing propaganda.
Nice and small speakers: the activists of #ReconquistaInternet
Leftist ideology with the dead!
"Unclear circumstances, why?"
"Then Macron was wrong, do you think? 🤔"
"Terrible events and their causes must be ruthlessly disclosed and criticized, even if that doesn&#39;t fit into your narrowed world view!"
It is interesting and typical left that the criticism excites you more than the terrible deed. Shame yourself!
"Yes, Mr. #Macron, this is what the blood price for the left experiment “Multi-cultural at any price” and the Islamization of Europe looks like!"
Your artificial left excitement is clearly visible to everyone.
The EU is doing something against alcohol abuse because it prohibits the application of &quot;digestible&quot; beer with 1.3%? 😂
"Isn&#39;t that incredible? The perfidious face of leftist ideology and contempt for human beings is clearly shown here. Our society has been contaminated by such and similar ideas for far too long.

"Rather, identical diversity rather than multi-cultural unity!"
No
Rather?
Right! Because then the war would never have happened! Thanks for the assessment.
"Very correct! Therefore, the AfD is against any extremism, whether left, right or religious. A brief explanation: CDU (today) = center-left, AfD = center-right."
Says left wing? 😂
"But clearly with &quot;center-right&quot;. After all, today we represent positions of the Union from 10 to 20 years ago and they were in the middle then, right? 😉"
"The social incompetence of the old party ranks? Who speaks it beautifully, except maybe the left league?"
"Perhaps because many are now doing this reflexively due to bad experiences. I have also blocked some of them here, but then there were really juicy insults from them."
"You can of course have the assessment, even if it was not justified here."
"Well, at least those who came here illegally and those who cause us great trouble."
"Oh, the article only applies the way you think link ideologists think that&#39;s right and good? 😂"
"&quot;Should the allegations be correct&quot;, the # CSU district administrator says ... Of course, these and countless other &quot;allegations&quot; are correct, since the fraud and threats posed by multi-cultural events are now commonplace.

"The CDU from 20 years ago was maybe right-wing. Today, with her defense of the total opening of the border and Eurocracy, she is at most left-center, whereby the &quot;middle&quot; is already fading. The AfD is clearly center-right."
For example. direct democracy and referendums at federal level! Further examples?
From whom exactly please?

"Oh, it wasn&#39;t that &quot;meant&quot; !? 😂 So what is clearly written can only apply as it suits you? That is embarrassing!"
"I didn&#39;t break a right, I only paid too late. Maybe it would have helped if left-wing extremists hadn&#39;t destroyed and looted my business, what do you think?"

And further? 🤔
"Because we clearly speak out against violence everywhere? Such nonsense again. But maybe your peers are only inciting the so-called refugees to the many # individual cases? It could be, right?"
Is not he.
"No, I don&#39;t know ..."
I think that&#39;s standard now? We always did that at Thor Steinar !? 🤔
"And you&#39;re a confused link ideologist, yes?"
"This is true in principle, but it shows what lies ahead if we give too much space to this Islam!"
The man is right.

"Limitless crime, abolition of nationalities, central government Brussels, paymaster Germany do you think?"

frightening
Pluralism with central government Brussels and a tendency to abolish nationalities? Her joke was really better.
"But targeted criticism and attentiveness would be the first step. And yet, in the event of danger, generalization is very well permitted, otherwise it is used everywhere in life without a left-wing circus."
Again: what exactly did I &quot;rush&quot; for?

"That is your extremely humble opinion, nothing more and nothing less."
"Politicians “shouldn&#39;t” throw swear words around right away, right. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t do it &quot;right away&quot;. But every now and then a politician should go up or down to the verbal level at which he is addressed."

"It is quite simple: an Islam that sees the Sharia instead of our GG as its legal and legitimate basis is unconstitutional. And I don&#39;t know of any Islam that Sharia renounces, do you?"

"No connection to the right scene according to the police, so I&#39;m sorry for the false start of the left propaganda machine."
"Do you want to know how? Inferring from yourself again, yes?"
"And do I get advice from Götz Kubitschek? That being said, why can&#39;t he be a democrat? Define “democrat”."
What are you doing here? 😄
What a crap! 😂
The roaring and blocking left-wing demonstrators often don&#39;t see it that way. But thanks.
"Exactly, that&#39;s how it is."
Just because you always do it that way?
Talk about your reading circle.
But gladly ...
"Dear patriots, see you again in Dresden next Monday at #Pegida! #AfDwirkt #NoIslam pic.twitter.com/hME2ZuuEG7"
No I do not know. So tell us if you can.
Here
Which facts exactly? The fact that the police said no connection to the right scene? The fact doesn&#39;t confuse me at all ...
"Don&#39;t like that the North Police Directorate said clearly: no connection to the right-wing scene highlighted. Doesn&#39;t fit into your worldview, yes? It must have been the right."
The positive motivation and good deed.
"Simplified to the point of nonsense! Right-wing populism = perceiving justified existing fears, responding to them and eliminating causes and not &quot;stirring up&quot; fears. Leftists stir up fears! For example. the fear of National Socialism that was about to break out again. The day before yesterday!"
It&#39;s hard to explain in two sentences here. But everyone can inform themselves about the definition of “extremist”.
You forgot about your bio as a hobby: &quot;trolling&quot;.
But above all for mostly useless integration measures.
"But of course. They have nothing else, they don&#39;t do politics at all."
"Neither Nazis nor Communists make politics there, but deputies who act according to the principle: the German people"
Which one exactly?
Not the &quot;right-wing extremists&quot;.
"Yes, halfway. This fecal language is also unmasking."
So and further? Was that all?
Again: which fake news exactly?
"Well, let&#39;s say the millions of migrants, but above all left-wing politics, are largely to blame, we want to remain reasonably objective."

😂👍🏻
"Unfortunately, you did not understand the tweet."
"Strangely enough, there is no left-wing radical ZeitGENOSSE on the list, or did I miss something?"
Would be even nicer.
"Oh, Tiger I, I don&#39;t think I would have a net in that thing."
Again: why don&#39;t the left &quot;haters&quot; from Antifa &amp; Co. also appear on it? 🤔 Only one-sided exclusion: caught!
"I only blocked them after they went on the pointer, also without a proper profile picture."
"Then the list should not have looked so one-sided, now nobody will buy the boil from you anymore."
"Well, just ask Mr. Böhmermann."
"Yes, me too, although I had never &quot;strayed&quot; to him. He probably has respect for both of us. 😉"
"Which one, for example?"
And what fake news exactly?
"Shut up because you left Kasper want that? Pfff ... If the left-wing radicals demonstrably tell garbage, then I will say the same, basta."
"Wrong, I don&#39;t describe everything on the left as extreme, how do you come up with such nonsense? And no, the AfD is not right-wing extremist but middle-right."
"How come? There is left-wing, right-wing or religiously motivated extremism. Why one-sided?"
"Oh, so it doesn&#39;t matter what the police say? But what the left-wing radical club Together says is true, of course? 😂🤦🏼♂️"
I beg your pardon? This is where a false claim is made correctly.
"Riots at Hasselbachplatz for FCM celebration are not due to right-wing extremists, according to the police information in the interior committee! Reporting, initiated by Begich von Miteinander e. V., was left propaganda and fake news. Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s correct @MDR_SAN &amp; Co.!"
"Oh, if I answer at the same level so that he understands it, is that below the belt? 😂 How do your buddies always say something like this: mimimi or something?"
"Another big left-stupid cinema! How wonderful the self-proclaimed fighters for democracy and tolerance regularly shoot themselves, delicious. 😂"
Where out? We are exactly where we have always been. 😄
Because I&#39;m holding up the mic on the right? 🤔
I am less concerned with the beginning than with the end.
The fact is: I don&#39;t &quot;hate&quot; and one should learn to differentiate criticism from hatred.
"Because &quot;extremes&quot; took part? So what. They received no micro or mention, so please keep the ball flat."
No. And further?
And you are for demonstrably wrong leftist propaganda? Or should something wrong be clarified?
Where and did I say the riots would &quot;matter&quot;? I just made the wrong statement on the left. Do you feel sick in the upper room?
Or a left “witness” who saw something like the police? And where have I ever sided with Hitler or Hitler salute?
So what...
"You can ask MEPs from the Greens (Striegel) or Leftists (Quade), they also sat in the committee meeting. The fact that these are not public is due to the old parties, ALL speak out against public meetings, except the AfD!"
"In fact, it happened that the left propaganda machine wanted to put the excesses on the “right” and did not confirm this."
What exactly should I have written to whom?
Yes and further? Rääächts &quot;blöken&quot; is standard with your peers.
Legal space again through so-called refugees in Germany? Our police now have the difficult task of ironing out this mistake. These are episodes of the left-wing multi-cultural experiment that the AfD has long warned of. #AfD #NoMultiKulti https://www.bild.de/news/inland/abschendung/abschiebe-verhundet-55573884.bildMobile.html?wtmc=fb.shr…
I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time. 😉
Economy run? 😄

"Why should he? He&#39;s not a racist, you&#39;re just too stupid to notice."
I know that a long time ago! 😄☝🏻
"#Oettinger wants over 12 billion more for Germany&#39;s #EU. Above all, he mentioned costs for migration and integration, i.e. left-wing social experiments. We say no to this EU and to multi-cultural at any price! #AfDwirkt #ContraEU #ProEuropa"
"Leftist (not bourgeois) but perfectly acceptable “counter-picnic” and at least radical left-wing rumbling counter-protest “more active” (more leftist reactionary!)

"Well, that&#39;s how “normal” people think about all this left-wing multi-cultural hype in Germany. Those who are still completely in their senses and not completely ideological can only shake their heads. #AfDwirkt # skilled workers http://m.aerzteblatt.de/blogs/66199.htm"
"I totally agree with you, but what does that have to do with this contribution?"
"The police, who constantly have to deal with left-wing peers like yours and are fed up with left-wing spinning."
"I have just pointed out that neither connects more than one &quot;list&quot;. And that is a shame, because the motives for it cannot be more different."
I answered you earlier regarding autograph.
"Little headwind? With daily left-wing hate messages, death threats, devastation of homes and business premises? 😂 My God in what world do you live! 🤦🏼♂️"
How do you get bullshit with the &quot;ethnic group&quot;? Had political classes again?
I&#39;ll do it anyway.
"Yes, that applies quite well to the left heap on the edge! Thanks for the addendum."
"Oh yes we do, but that&#39;s okay too."
"Oh, it is too much fun for me to have the left-handers demonstrated for myself. 😂"
Again wrong thought! But you probably know that.
"No, then I would also be &quot;left&quot;. 😄 But you are undoubtedly left ideology!"
"In my speech, however, I addressed the violent left-wing extremists. Others don&#39;t need to feel mentioned."
"Exactly, why is there so little of it at #Antifa &amp; Co.? I always see them screaming, screeching and rioting. Should it be &quot;love&quot;? Take care of yourself."
"Unfortunately there are none but a &quot;list&quot;, that&#39;s the sad thing!"
"I think it&#39;s very appropriate to take a positive example in every respect from Schindler&#39;s list, isn&#39;t it?"
Did you mean violent left-wing extremists?
If you send me your address here via PM you will of course get one.
You mean for &quot;justified criticism&quot; ?!
"But it did not deprive me of my trust, even if it may annoy left-wing agitators immeasurably. 😂"
"You can&#39;t even distinguish populist, radical and extremist! So just don&#39;t play yourself up. The only thing you know is &quot;fool-talker&quot; because you are talking about your own appearance."
"No, I do not think so. And what about &quot;proliferation of the German body&quot; for violent left-wing extremists is now exactly &quot;NS&quot;? Tell! &quot;Proliferation&quot;? wrong, &quot;German&quot;? wrong, &quot;people&#39;s body&quot;? not correct. I said what I think, what do I care about the Nazis?"
"I think so too, thanks."
But nobody cares what you think is better.
But whether that was a left-wing extremist ... http://www.taz.de/!5491290/
"You mean because I&#39;ve been attacked by left-wing extremists several times, right?"
So it is only an unproven assumption.
"I have been attacked by them, there is nothing friendly, violent extremists."
"Yes, you are too embarrassing ..."
Neither - nor you left Trantüte ...
Yes there too.
"Neither, nor"
But that would be &quot;peaceful&quot; for the first time.
"We do not discriminate, we criticize and defend ourselves against groups of people who endanger our peaceful coexistence."
"social market economy, national identity, peaceful Europe of the mother countries"
"Otherwise it would not be &quot;how&quot;? Then we wouldn&#39;t have had the best state election result with me at the top in Saxony-Anhalt, or what exactly do you mean?"
"Stupid, no even left-stupid only you seem to be here. And no, I do not generally want to deport every immigrant, we right-wing populists can differentiate a bit, but you do not know anything like this in your left (self) hatred."
"I didn&#39;t do either, very simply. So everything is fine and no extremism."
Wrong thought!
I do not think so.
"Yes, the right-wing extremists sometimes have leftists in the ranks who call Heil-Hitler ... Everything is not so easy."
"Well that was great, yes? pic.twitter.com/hFvTOQJKRD"
Then do it tomorrow with the Linkschaoten. I wish you much success and love ...
What kind of left rubbish are you telling? 😂🤦🏼‍♂️ Nothing else on the pan.
And why please? What do you (supposedly) know about my finances?
"Why should I please? Everything is and was paletti, otherwise I would be insolvent, right?"
"You have to say that with love to the left-wing rioters tomorrow, not to me. 😉"
Yes I had! And further?
"So we didn&#39;t have any former NSDAP members in the AfD, unlike others. The magpie wrote left garbage again. 😂"
"Nope, right-wing populist please."
"Oh thank you very much, but does not change the correctness of the contribution."
"As a political spokesman for extremism, I&#39;m already feeling sorry for police forces tomorrow in Berlin, Hamburg and elsewhere. &quot;1. May riots ”will once again make it clear what link ideologues are really about: anarchy &amp; riot in the black block. #AfD #NoAntifa"
"Apart from the lack of arguments, the left cannot do that in terms of character. They mob, rush and insult on our pages, day after day, without any effect."
"Yeeeeee ... human, you are a left boredom. Always the same curd. That you have such a problem with other pol. Having opinions is really worrying. What is going wrong in your life?"
"Well over 1000 participants of the AfD event, about 100 partly roaring left-wing demonstrators in the best sunshine and clear speeches that spoke to people from the soul. #AfDwirkt #Poggenburg https://www.rtl.de/cms/mehrere-hundert-menschen-bei-afd-kundlassung-gegendemos-4156006.html…"

But that&#39;s not why you are “wonderful”.
"Thank god I&#39;m too realistic for that. Nice wishful thought, but only that."
Neither do I! I&#39;m doing something.
"Rather not, the VS clearly says: no extremism. But you know everything better, right?"
Doooch! You are the best example!
Which office exactly did I &quot;have to&quot; give back because of alleged extremism? 🤔
"If no arrest warrant is issued, everything has been withdrawn. And now head to ..."
Again wrong thought! Are you not unfamiliar with what? 😂
"Oh no, I mean the left-wingers&#39; wish for anarchy!"
Wrong: #ProAfD it says
Just a bit&quot;? Aren&#39;t you going to be stingy?
Well I thought about the &quot;right&quot; already take care of you? 🤔
Right! Then why do your people carry so much hatred on the street and foreign accounts? What do you think?
"Read ... everything is fine with me, by the way says the VS. Something else?"
Then please go to the ENT!
Very easy! Anti-fascism that does not use fascist methods!
"I did, but I don&#39;t feel threatened because the room has never been &quot;empty&quot;, not even figuratively."
Honey of course!
Didn&#39;t get beyond the reading guide with Mimi and Momo?
The &quot;dear&quot; was already completely correct ...
What exactly am I afraid of? 🤔 The left chaos again demolish my business and private spaces and devastate everything? First try this with your own people with “love instead of hate”!
"So I like # catnip tea, just by the way."
But that&#39;s not how it works.
"Then I miss the left-wing agitators from #Antifa &amp; Co. on the list, who write hate officers every day! 😄"
Political exit? Would you like to? No no ... ☝🏻
"What does @janboehm actually want with this # Böhmermann list? Exclude and stigmatize those who think differently about politics, or just check out a little? Take an example from #Schindler&#39;s list, that was civil courage! #AfDeffkt #FreakBoehmermann"
"But no, that would be extremely unrealistic. If I say: &quot;All people are wonderful&quot;, I would excuse the #Nazis and again draw the anger and hatred of your buddies to me. 😄☝🏻"
"I like to do! Love instead of left hate, tolerance instead of left agitation - I&#39;m there!"
Then explain to your rioting left buddies! 😉
middle right
"I am long, thank you."
Maybe you can still see the connection yourself. 😄
"Of course, it has to do with the naive, unrealistic so-called good people attitude. And with the concentrated and inhumane serious crime in the wake of illegal mass immigration. But you don&#39;t understand that now, do you?"
Read?
What exactly is supposedly &quot;lying&quot; in the article?
What have I &quot;polarized&quot;? That Germany is the absolute main payer of the EU construct?
My god you are stupid! Where did I &quot;immigrate&quot; to? I have been living in Saxony-Anhalt for over 40 years. We are all looking forward to your witty answer!
The only one who exudes &quot;hate&quot; here is you intellectual flyweight.
He definitely means the cause of the daily # individual cases.
Oh? Then explain to us what financial benefits the German people actually have from the EU.
The howlers are clearly here!
And wrong again ... I do not shout &quot;lies press&quot;. Nice try but as always full left-stupid next to it. 😂
Do you say left upper troll? 😄
Which instance did that with the &quot;extremist&quot; determine? But isn&#39;t it just your left-wing mind? 🤔
Rather the other way around. Anyone who is not on the left is a right wing for you. But I&#39;m standing in the middle right. Stop rushing or tolerate echo.
"Yes, left-wing ideologists cannot stand it when politically dissenting people come together peacefully. The arrogant sole claim to political legitimation is a typical characteristic of left-wing people like @StriegSe &amp; Co., so dictatorships were introduced earlier. pic.twitter.com/inOb7tjbZh"
That is your extremely humble opinion! ☝🏻
"So I think he was never convicted, so innocent. Is this enough? Or do you as a left ideologist with the legal system have your problem there? 🤔"
"It&#39;s in no hurry, is it?"
"No, because he reports * wrongly * and completely tendentiously."
I have never taken an oath of disclosure and have never been bankrupt or bankrupt. Where exactly is the failure in business now? Explain times.
"Oh, bankruptcy delay without subsequent bankruptcy !? Let alone criminal proceedings etc.? 😂 Rather a sign that there was no procrastination and there was more left spinning behind it, right?"
The &quot;rumor&quot; is left-wing agitation. I stopped operating in 2016 because I have been a member of the state parliament. As far as understood?
"Can&#39;t stand the echo? Typical left-stupid! Always call those who think differently from the right, but howl yourself when you are called extreme left ... 🤦🏼‍♂️"
What does that have to do with your howling? 🤔
"Then tell me exactly what is anti-Semitic, hateful to the people in our program! We are all very excited."
"I have never been arrested, never made an oath of disclosure, and have never been insolvent. So why failed, explain in more detail."
Yes and where is bankruptcy or bankruptcy?
Schufa is completely empty for me. Not with you?
Oh? Then why was I never arrested? Wasn&#39;t it possible to find me at my umpteen events? 😂 This time you went too far - Parag. 188 SCC ...
"You allude to Stalinism and Maoism, yes?"
Cheap links again ...
"Right, since I am center-right, I totally agree with you. And I differentiate very well between extreme left, radical left and populist left. The other side usually only knows: everything to the right of the &quot;middle&quot; is - #Nazi. A couple of stupid rattles, right?"
But radical right = National Socialist? 🤔 Doesn&#39;t a journalist downplay National Socialism?
But howling are you here! 😂
That is your extremely humble opinion. And now take a look at the piles of your left-wing extremist spiritual brothers.
"Bankruptcy is clearly regulated, first inform, then criticize."
Says a radical left chamber pot? 🤔
"1. Everything was paid for before the diets. 2. 250 people were there during the protest walk, before there were many more at the rally, so my statement fits exactly 3. Right-wing extremist = Nazi? So left-wing extremists = Stalinists? Not too easy?"
"Oh, and what is on Wikipedia is automatically the truth? By the way, where does it say that I was bankrupt or bankrupt?"
See you in Berlin on #Home! #AfDwirkt pic.twitter.com/Qfov8VBzO9
Let&#39;s say good night. 😉
Why are about 300 people &quot;few listeners&quot;? How can Thor Steinar be a &quot;Nazi brand&quot;? Why am I defamed as a &quot;failed businessman&quot; even though I&#39;ve never been bankrupt or bankrupt? Is Henrik Merker from @zeitonline a red political commissioner? https://blog.zeit.de/stoerungsmelder/2018/04/27/die-russland-fans-der-afd_26245…
But without illegal mass immigration!
"Oh yes, please continue with exactly this kind of pick! You will become a top AfD campaigner and take my title."
Did I say &quot;get rid of&quot;? Islam simply violates the (Basic) Law and is therefore contrary to the Basic Law. I didn&#39;t say more.
"Parroting today&#39;s political commissioners, instead of thinking for themselves, is more popular with the left wing!"
Today everything is the same as agitation or defamation that is said against multiculturalism and everyone is a Nazi who speaks out against the impossible behavior of so many so-called refugees.
Are you &quot;just thinking&quot;? Please do not do anything that will undoubtedly overwhelm you! 😂 #AfDeffects
"Oh, because we name the cause and demand remedial action, which would also remove the reasoned fear, do we stir up hatred? I see it differently. 🤔 And why do the left-wing shots and Islam terrorists “hate” so much? We are also to blame for that, right?"
"Wrong again. The fear is there and very justified, due to daily so-called # individual cases of so-called refugees. Nothing needs to be &quot;stoked&quot;, but the situation must be &quot;criticized&quot; and we do that."
"Completely (left) - wrong. We “judge” based on statements and deeds, not based on biological characteristics! And anti-EU = pro-Europe and is not nationalistic but national. Finally learn the difference, thanks."
"If it had at least given food for thought, it would have been a sign of reason."
"Then have a look at Spinner in the Duden on the definition of racism! It&#39;s about biological characteristics. My god, how stupid left can only make ... 🤦🏼‍♂️"
"Unlike you, I know the Basic Law, so I know that Islam is contrary to the Basic Law, just like left-wing anarchy."
You too can have your unrealistic opinion. Perhaps you prefer to spread them on your side and not here? 🤔
"Maybe, but why are you telling me that? I am clearly against National Socialism, just like against Communism, and also not a racist, because I judge according to statements and actions and not based on biological characteristics."
Incredible and shameful! I don&#39;t want to know what would have happened to the woman if she hadn&#39;t made an emergency call. It is horrifying to see again and again how this degenerative good man ideology eliminates any healthy caution. https://www.wochenblick.at/afrikaner-verschleppt-frau-und-haelt-sie-als-sexsklavin/…
"Have the others been prevented from demonstrating and threatened with violence? 🤔 If so, also condemn."
Maybe you should start taking things seriously!
Not affordable with an annual contribution of 30 euros? 🤔

"Mh ... I see you more as a fan of the &quot;Khmer Rouge&quot;. Admit it, hit it, right? It becomes clear in each of your hate, oppressive commis. Everything has to be switched red. Blue &amp; Co. simply cannot exist."
Then tell me exactly what is bothering you about it. But please reasonably factually.
"Exactly because I&#39;ve been training them for 20 years. 😂 How stupid can you be. Keep it up, it&#39;s entertaining!"
"So we can finally see a picture of you, yes? 😂"
"Who was condemned as &quot;right-wing extremist&quot;? You know it so well, so please?"
"The Office for the Protection of the Constitution sees it differently, as it has not identified any right-wing extremism. But of course you left-wing class passers-by know everything better, right?"
I didn&#39;t do it either. It will not get better.
"1. Because inclusion is a completely exaggerated form of integration 2. Because the people affected are less individually supported, even close special schools 3. Because it is simply not a good thing to lower the level of performance compulsively from 9 because 1 does not help anyone"
They are rather too stupid to separate the terminology! 😄
"And you&#39;re in a good mood again, right? Show me the Muslim who clearly renounces Sharia!"
"Islam, based on Sharia law, is clearly against the law! #AfDwirkt #NoIslam pic.twitter.com/ptTn5szNkh"
So how do you make a miserable red? 🤔
Red manure.
Right! By really clarifying the unbelievability of the old parties.
"Wrong again! It really won&#39;t be human with you anymore. 🤦🏼‍♂️ I make a distinction between the extreme left, radical left and populist. Incidentally, never get your peers the other way around."
"This is also not possible for you, because you can verbally kick as you want! 😄☝🏻"
Never thought that we would come back to a time when communists outside of their ideoogy call everything and everyone Nazis.
The world is diversity you simple minded! A variety of cultures and identities and not your left-wing uniform. #NoMultiKulti
Then you first learn to read poor drip.
In layman? But apt for that.
"We do not exclude disabled people or homosexuals, so I did not mean them, you bastard. Gay marriage is such a practice."
Who says that? She?
None of the Pius brotherhood was there. 😄
"No, it wasn&#39;t an anarcho demo! Everything peaceful, AfD stop."
As if you could logic! 😂
You like your left heap and drooling cracker always?
Then off to the ophthalmologist for a little more insight!
"Do you mean your kind, who roar through the streets in a “fight against fascism”? You are just embarrassing! And soon history ..."
Who says we&#39;re pacifists? Not paying attention again?
"Can&#39;t you understand, right? I wonder why!? 😄"
Who says that?
Where and when did I sit on the ass? Are you rummaging around in your own life?
Exactly ... learned by heart.
"And precisely because I know it, I know that it is not a “chimera”."
Why lie press? Do you use the expression? Not me.
Right...
Who&#39;s crying here? But rather you.
The howler is more like you.
From Stalinists like you? 😂
"I was never convicted, there was not even a trial and yes, that says a lot: namely that some link ideologues constantly tell garbage and artificially flare up."
Where exactly do you see a problem?
When aggressive communists call others Nazis and thus play down National Socialism. 🤦🏼♂️
Why only at Easter? And who are these brothers?
Lying with what exactly?
Why please? Where has the AfD campaigned against peace and war so far?
What else can you say to a left spinner than: left spinner?
"After all, you allow me a &quot;core competence&quot;. 😄 Now don&#39;t get jealous!"
"More red groats, isn&#39;t it? 😄🤦🏼♂️"
"Oh, if link ideologists are jealous, they can&#39;t bake anything themselves, but they buzz around. 😄"
"We know that very well, we are not stupid to the left. And why &quot;our&quot; Wehrmacht? Are you a little confused, yes?"
Link Spinner? 🤔

Who wants to convert a Stalinist like you? The fact is: you wrote nonsense and just rushed around.
"Why does gun violence mean shooting automatically? Can you even shoot with a stun gun, for example? You have a lot of imagination, unfortunately very negative."
Are you slightly stupid? 1. I&#39;m not Frau von Storch 2. Didn&#39;t she say anything about shooting but about gun violence.
Where and when did I say that? You left Kasper.
"Are you now talking about the many right-wing &quot;propaganda offenses&quot; such as smearing a forbidden sign etc.? Violent crimes are more of a concern. Ä., right?"
Center-right is correct. We mostly represent positions of a CDU from 20 years ago.
"Very classy. Left, right?"
"I have been training successfully for 20 years, so a left-wing spinner doesn&#39;t have to tell me anything. 😂"
I never have to take an oath of revelation if you left frog. Typical communist agitator.
"With regional unemployment figures, sometimes. in the double digits?"
"Of course, thanks."
Who for example? Do you have data on bankruptcy or bankrupt entrepreneurs who do this?
"Migration agency opens in the district hall Burgenlandkreis; Landrecht Ulrich speaks and we like to believe him that companies in the district are looking for workers and specialists. Reason: quite simply failed education, training and further education policy. #AfD #NoMultiKulti"
Photographed in the mirror? 😄
"Always do it with your buddies, right? Not my league."
Tell me. Are you talking about yourself?
And you trivialize National Socialism.
What do you know about my family? Or about patriotism? 😂
Should probably remind you of the scenery at that time.
Everything great!
"Well, that&#39;s unfortunately nothing new. You have no real arguments."
Would be nice if the school or nursery would have shaped you. 🤦🏼♂️
Yes and further?
"Again wrong thought! Slowly annoying yourself, yes?"
"It was about using gun violence, not just shooting. As the owner of the weapon expertise, I can tell you that these may be two different things."
"Just make yourself ridiculous! 🤦🏼‍♂️ We do not summon, but warn of an impending civil war in the face of catastrophic development. So we want to prevent it. This is what characterizes us as “peacekeepers”. Stupid, yes?"
"I can well imagine that there could be a left-wing counter-demonstration, i.e. a demo FOR war. 😄"
We don&#39;t exclude anyone as a person just because we don&#39;t approve of every social practice.
Leftists always say to us about something like this: conspiracy theorists
"What exactly, please?"
"Where is that in the program please? Perhaps you are referring to legal regulations on the use of firearms for civil servants? They are certainly correct, but not from the AfD."
Do you realize that patriotism and nationalism are not the same thing? 🤔
"No, and I don&#39;t care about left-wing videos either."
"Then I choose “Germany the Germans”. Disposing and hydrated lime is more the part of comrades, like you, when I think of Mao and Stalin."
You are a communist and left-wing leader through and through.
What kind of garbage are you telling again?
Would be rejected exactly like that. Current war rhetoric and attacks came from the West. The east was more prudent.
Now everything starts again from the communist ... 🤦🏼‍♂️
I beg your pardon?

"So how do you? Eher No, rather not."
The regional center for political education is #Nazi?

They are already playing at SPD party conferences!

"As a real opposition politician, my job is not a statesman but plain text."
"#USA vetoed the # UN Security Council against the violence in the Israeli-Palestinian border area. Well, you can do that. However, where is the global outcry, as with similar vetoes from Russia or China? But everything just a big play?"
Christian Church wishes for peaceful coexistence of all cultures. That is very welcome! Now the only thing missing is the insight that some (un) culture does not want to tolerate peaceful coexistence or diverse coexistence and one has to be able to criticize that. #AfDeffects #Diversity
"Oh, do you have evidence that Höcke wrote for them? Tell me about it. Or just stupid left-wing nonsense?"
"I &quot;didn&#39;t&quot; have to resign from any office, I just did it. If one wished for some politicians of the old parties, the post-hashers cannot! And my pole. Certificate of good conduct was and is blossom white, only marginally."
"And you worship Stalinism and want tens of millions of dead again, right?"
Didn&#39;t keep it up yourself? 😄
Again wrong thought ... you know.
"# SPD course is clear and it says: &quot;Keep it up&quot; With &quot;Bätschi&quot;, &quot;damn shit&quot; and &quot;on the face&quot; the new old style of the SPD is now even the leading culture. Nevertheless, parts of the system press sell Nahles as &quot;state-supporting&quot;! #AfD #Schandmaul http://m.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nach-der-wahl-von-nahles-die-spd-in-der-sackgasse-15554857.html…"
Very high left level again! 😄
Interested in Sharia? Get to know a Muslim who clearly rejects Sharia law? There you have your answer.
"Porn Hansi, why Wilders?"
"But I have not threatened anyone, done violence or abused. What now? Again only left nonsense secreted? 🤔"
You sure meant leftist violence ... right?
See you on April 25th. Peace demonstration in Torgau! https://www.compact-online.de/fuer-frieden-und-freundschaft-mit-russland-demo-mit-poggenburg-elsaesser-ua-25-4-torgau/…
Ms. Hohmann and I could well imagine that.
"Think !: At that time the CDU wanted to get involved in the Iraq war, luckily the outrage in the German people made the SPD government move to be silly at the time. Something like that cannot be prevented with people like you."
You trivialize National Socialism! Disgusting.
Left stupid agitation. Just because the AfD speaks out against illegal mass immigration and against left-wing extremism does not want National Socialism back. The Nazi club is primitive and worn out!
"If you are a communist and you can do nothing but defame others than Nazis because you have no other arguments, bed yourself in the garbage heap of history. A woman hardly lets someone under her skirt. 😂"
"An aspect of criminal events in the wake of illegal mass immigration. If the employee can be proven beyond any doubt, then she would have to go behind bars for a long time, with the damage she has done to the economy and the people! #AfD #NoMultiKulti pic.twitter.com/3HBR93qIDY"
Oh? Who was that supposed to be?
"Now you&#39;ve given it back to me. Such a real left verbal hook, yes? 😄🤦🏼♂️"
Do you have some reading / spelling weakness? Where is the problem?
"Left class kasper, go mob somewhere else!"
"So you&#39;re clearly a racist, aren&#39;t you?"
I think you are a bit mentally ill and a flawless Stalinist.
Why this? Do you have anything against cultivated foreign influence?
Do you have anything against foreigners in general or in particular?
"Like you are a Stalinist, yes?"
"First, the AfD does not flirt with the Nazi era, second, I have not criticized Israel in any way, but raised a question about left-wing ideology. You are welcome to answer it."
"Again: the message I am referring to came yesterday evening in the Tagesschau. The suspension took place beforehand and has nothing to do with Israel not wanting to get rid of it. So as a leftist, it’s really hard to understand, right?"
Who spoke of right or wrong here? Just answer the question of the contribution.
Then you are not able to read AND understand my post properly? Where did I write about &quot;solved case&quot;?
Container and apparatus manufacturers please ... and a merchant ... with training in technical business administration ... and many years of training in commercial and craft professions ... now a member of the Landtag ... if you want to talk about my professions.
"Since when has justified criticism of murder and homicide been like baiting? You want a left-wing Stalinist control state again, by accepting everything calmly and without criticism, yes?"
Please where was my contribution exactly &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;? Please enlighten us with your left hypocrisy!
"Right, has triggered protest because the proposed solution was too weak and there would still have been too many “refugees” there. First inform, then criticize!"
"I absolutely have to contradict that, no country should be burned to the ground."
But the majority there is clearly on this policy of the &quot;responsible&quot; !? 🤔
"Yes, yes ... you only drop unqualified ramblings here and become insulting, a great achievement. Allow one more question: you are on the left, yes?"
"Oh ... there are &quot;shades of gray&quot; and that depends on the nationality, of course? You are a miserable # racist!"
