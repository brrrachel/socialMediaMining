This is why we developed &quot;La strategi√© Fran√ße&quot; on Saarland.
Congratulations . Great reinforcement in group leadership and another strong voice for work and social issues.
I am pleased that a piece by Wolfgang Sch√§uble is returning to the BMF with STS Werner Gatzer. Good signal for a stable budget with no new debt.
My week in Berlin starts with ... bright sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è Wish everyone a good start!

"I&#39;m not fundamentalist, I&#39;m not evangelical, and I don&#39;t live in the United States. I am committed to life with the CDU on the floor of the GG, born and unborn. We therefore stand by the applicable protection concept and this includes the advertising ban."
Germany offers religious freedom on the basis of the Basic Law. Anyone who moves away from this ground and abuses this freedom does not want to belong and is not allowed to.
