. @ ManfredWeber: The Social Democrats in the European Parliament want to enforce Europe-wide unemployment insurance. I dont want that. We do not want redistribution and debt Europe. #BRextra #YourEurope
. @ ManfredWeber: Not every question in Europe is a question for Europe. The EU has enough tasks. There are many points that are better discussed nationally. #BRextra #YourEurope
. @ ManfredWeber: We are the ones who create law and order at the EU&#39;s external border. The SPD has rejected the increase in funds for EU border protection in the European Parliament. #migrationEU #BRextra #YourEurope
. @ ManfredWeber: Those who are obliged to leave must leave our country. The SPD has softened the proposals for deportations. It is a key task to reject rejected asylum seekers. #migrationEU #BRextra #YourEurope
". @ ManfredWeber: When it comes to climate protection, we agree that we need ambition. But the SPD and the Greens are risking jobs with their excessive demands. Our car industry cannot lose and Tesla wins. #BRextra #YourEurope"
". @ ManfredWeber: Selfishness and nationalism are back in Europe. Salvini and the AfD know what they are against, but not what they are for. They don&#39;t even have a common program. #BRextra #YourEurope"
. @ ManfredWeber: The devastating fire of Notre Dame has shown that we have a common European basis. Many people in Europe feel connected to the people of Paris. #BRextra #YourEurope
