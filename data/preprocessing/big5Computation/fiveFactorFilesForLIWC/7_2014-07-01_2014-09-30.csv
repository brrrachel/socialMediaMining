@Tobias_B is still dumber? I&#39;m without any ifs and buts to ensure Israel&#39;s security AND for a free Palestinian state. This works out!
I just don&#39;t believe that German arms deliveries are promoting peace in the Middle East! This is no reason for defamatory insinuations!
@l_hornung @christiansoeder rhetorical questions are not just stupid on Twitter.

"In Germany, danger comes again and certainly not for the first time from the right! Those who adore themselves on the right should wake up!"
"Ex-parties on the National Front will surely have advantages for a generation in terms of personnel, organization + coal, but will NOT explain the result."
@MGrosseBroemer Nevertheless: Your deliberate non-election participation date on the last holiday Sunday is and remains a democratic scandal!
"@MGrosseBroemer no, colleague, also self-criticism with us, but as a non-block party, like Greens, we still have disadvantages compared to the CDU."
"Why is so many citizens of Saxony so democratic? Tillich&#39;s vacation choice date is just an explanation, not an excuse."
"Of course I would have liked SPD more, but low voter turnout and rights &amp; right-wing populists follow from Tillich&#39;s non-election strategy."
"Return from Wroclaw from commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Ferdinand Lasalle&#39;s death. Freedom, justice, solidarity. #SPD +++"
Low turnout and success of Nazis and right-wing populists in Saxony is due to Tillich&#39;s CDU vacation (not) election date!
"@ gerrit_1986 I admit, something like that is not excluded ;-)"
"@grrrlsarestrong well, maybe in the case of self-staging - Frau von der Leyen is on the trail of Freiherr zu Guttenberg."

"Ganove Ronald Barnabas Schill becomes TV presenter: Can old buddies like AFD &amp; Co. invite. One wonders, but still less level is possible."
SPIEGEL writes of &quot;toll and claw disease&quot; - that is the cabinet&#39;s internal code name for the favorite project of CSU Minister Dobrindt.
Source Surprise: Focus on the market with the slimmest anti-SPD propaganda before the Thuringian election. That will hardly affect a voter.

@ Doppelgeist60 @MatthiasMeisner But you are also funny ;-)
As if it was necessary to react to weak opposition and even weaker speeches in the end really wasn&#39;t worth it.
"SH opposition leader Callsen is really cute: According to the MP speech, no one from the coalition defended it again against CDU &amp; FDP attacks. And?"
"@pscljnsn @christiansoeder Nonsense, do not share BP Gauck&#39;s position, but criticized the left because the military does not threaten peace."
"@petertauber @christiansoeder Caution, colleague, in which category does Ms. von der Leyen fall with her &quot;military taboo violations&quot;?"
"@christiansoeder Frank can&#39;t say that, I can."
"@christiansoeder because he is constantly pouring oil into the fire, but we need prudence from those responsible in the West!"
"@christiansoeder as Rasmussen, that&#39;s right ;-)"
NATO Secretary General Rasmussen apparently sleeps on cannon barrels. It&#39;s a good thing that he will soon be replaced by the sensible Jens Stoltenberg.
"Because of the many inquiries and abbreviations or interpretations that distort the meaning, the entire text can be read here! http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article131834715/Hinter-Merkel-ist-viel-schwarzes-Nichts.html‚Ä¶"

@RasmusAndresen was a colleague of Notz ;-)
"I do not share the position of Federal President Gauck on the matter, but weapons and the military do not threaten peace."
@petertauber Von because of - nothing of fear and paternalism - in the interview text statement red-green commonality and black backwardness!
glauchau
"@RasmusAndresen Read entire interview text, not agency reports, colleague! There is nothing in it about warnings or threats."
"@SevimDagdelen @tauss I do not share Mr. Gauck&#39;s opinion, but it is troops and weapons that endanger peace, not presidential words!"

Follow the debate on arms deliveries to northern Iraq in the SPD parliamentary group.
Immediately after 7 in the ZDF Morgenmagazin in an interview with Dunja Hayali.
Today is the international anti-war day! Today 75 years ago Nazi Germany invaded Poland and opened the terrible Second World War!
wishes everyone a good start to the week ;-)
"In addition, interview and media appointments. I will follow the debate in the Bundestag on Northern Iraq; evening election campaign for Brandenburg SPD."
"Union-internal criticism of Dobrindt (BAMS &quot;Aus die Maut&quot;) underlines 3 conditions from the KOA contract (EU law, revenue, no additional burden)."
BAMS calls von der Leyens Outfit &quot;Top Gun Optics&quot; when German tornadoes are adopted via Iraq. STERN is titled &quot;Minister of War&quot;.
Just on the 150th anniversary of the death of Lasalle (death in a duel) I read in the SHZ that I would have an eternal duel with a member of the Kiel parliament. Oha- be careful ;-)
"Fortunately, the hard to bear Rasmussen will soon be replaced by the level-headed Jens Stoltenberg as NATO Secretary General."
Wolfgang Bok&#39;s article in SHZ on Sunday &quot;Just no need&quot; shows that even in 2014 every reactionary clich√© can be surpassed!
Then back to Berlin in the evening. The HSV game yesterday was like the weather today. There is a lot of room for improvement! Have a beautiful Sunday!
"Yours Saxony: Today, finish the last sad black and yellow chapter and make it fairer for Martin Dulig and the SPD Saxony!"
"Important founding father of German social democracy and a fighter for freedom, justice and solidarity."
Good morning from Hamburg. Early on rainy Sunday morning on the way to Wroclaw for the 150th anniversary of the death of Ferdinand Lasalle

My contribution to the discussion about German arms exports: Many make it very easy! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=741172959282243&amp;id=480641715335370‚Ä¶
Today we deliver weapons and tomorrow we are totally amazed that it kills innocent people - what is the moral behind it?
@ Orakel2000 @Matthias_Teh @AnkeJulieMartin this unfortunate Saddam Hussein the West had upgraded against the Iranian Ayatollahs.
"This &quot;Si vis pacem, paar bellum&quot; philosophy has never convinced me and historically has little convincing evidence to offer."
"Aha understand, whoever does not advocate arms delivery no longer has all cups in the closet. What is that curly logic?"
The US has revised part of the aftermath of the war in Iraq through military successes against cruel IS militias. Persecuted people need humanitarian aid!
Nazi Germany set fire to the world and was militarily defeated and liberated by the international community after cruel genocide.
@pscljnsn Wrong - there are historical lessons that you also have to understand!
I am amazed at how easy it is for some to do this 100 years after the start of World War 1 and 75 years after the start of World War 2!
Nothing is simplistic about war! Does Kurdistan logic also apply to eastern Ukraine? What about Palestine and Gaza? Military solution too?
"The United States has directly helped Northern Iraq, and Germany has provided humanitarian aid. Do we want to be a war party now? Kurdish state? Weapons proliferation?"
"@christiansoeder there is nothing. Allied forces have liberated Nazi Germany-yes. Still, you have to make it a lot harder!"
@christiansoeder when have weapons brought peace in human history - how often have they brought suffering and death to the civilian population?
"Unfortunate Bush war against Iraq destroyed all structures, which made the cruel terrorism of the Islamist IS militia possible."
@christiansoeder it remains correct as an attitude of social democracy!
"Yes to the help of the international community in self-defense, self-defense, ending or preventing genocide! No to the neo-war logic!"
@kaffeeringe I still buy my books in the bookstore.

"@_AKHH_ think American action is right there, Germany helps humanitarian, I had already committed to self-defense + self-defense!"
"However, I find it difficult to believe that wars solve any problem: victims are always people who suffer and die from real weapons."
"Gun deliveries, more military engagement - strange mood in the year 100 after World War I. Self-defense, self-defense completely okay."
Interesting interview with Margot K√§√ümann in the new SPIEGEL. She persistently argues against the cynical logic of a military primate.
"@DerBruesseler you mean IS terrorist militia? In this case, I was not concerned with foreign policy, but with dealing with terrorists in this country."
"Strange: Those who act consistently against IS terrorist militia, but do not want to abolish the German rule of law, are insulted in social media."
"@ siegfried175 other countries We will not be able to hinder, but we can lead by example!"
Export vice world champion really does not have to deliver weapons to areas of tension and dictatorships. That has to be changed! Peace instead of profit!

"@Kunkakom that&#39;s right, sometimes the voters make different decisions than they would have liked, that&#39;s democracy."
"Incidentally, I told the FAS journalist that &quot;junior partnership&quot; for SPD can never be an election goal, not worthwhile, no matter with whom."
"Have expressly given no advice to party friends in Thuringia. When it comes to coalition issues, public advice is more of a blow!"
@MikeMohring which red-red recommendation? My tip: Reading text increases the chance that your political commentary could be meaningful.
Just for once: Our Thuringian SPD top candidate is Heike Taubert! Ms. Lieberknecht and Mr. Ramelow are competitors in the election campaign.
What is not to be understood because of all criminal consequences against convicted Islamist terrorists? Yes! Stammtisch suggestions? No!
"@ qwertzman1000 the word &quot;expatriation&quot; implies withdrawal of German citizenship, my reference to the Basic Law referred to that."
"Violence must be condemned, no matter who it comes from! No political justification except for self-defense! Would ease some debate!"
"Will support Thuringian party friends in the election campaign; Competition already distributes furs before bear is sighted, let alone killed."
Who is really surprised that Russia is now itself imposing economic sanctions? Sanctions spiral will not solve a problem.

"Incidentally, it is always worth paying attention to who gets the praise when the SPD recommends changing priorities."
@ Doppelgeist60 the desire of some to revive lost fights from yesterday has something masochistic for me - that&#39;s rather strange to me!
I am annoyed by one-sided descriptions of the Gaza war and the Ukraine crisis. Militarization of language + thinking is booming again!
A people&#39;s party must always supplement the program and many policy areas occupy the core of social justice brands is not up for grabs!
SPD has learned its lessons from membership and election losses. SPD-Linke played a decisive role in this - see election program + KOA contract!
Complementing socially just policies for good work with successful economic + education policies in government responsibility - that&#39;s it!
"Supposedly SPD-Linke is without influence and we need &quot;new middle&quot; again, third ways, devaluation of work etc. Bullshit! We already had it!"
Arms lobbyists criticize calling arms exports in dictatorships + areas of tension &quot;business with death&quot;. But that&#39;s why: Change!

"@ArminLaschet yes, but, mister, not so modest, after all, one of your greatest negotiation was &quot;success&quot; ;-)"
@SturmDaniel doubt that this is possible in this coalition with the CSU. For 25% we negotiated a lot.
"Judging differently also means criticizing Russia and East Ukrainian separatists, but also Ukrainian victims of violence."
"To judge differently means to show solidarity with civilian victims of military violence, whether from Hamas missiles or Israeli bombs."
Wonder about black and white fixation. One can and must criticize Hamas violence as well as the Israeli government&#39;s occupation policies.
@ArminLaschet I really did not say that - you should let colleagues Dobrindt know ;-)
"Intolerance + xenophobia are totally unacceptable, regardless of religion, skin color, gender, sexual orientation - anything else!"
Difficult to understand? Strict no to anti-Semitism and resolute rejection of any intolerance towards other people belong together!
"Seehofer is wrong when criticizing the SPD arms export policy change: with us, no arms exports to areas of tension and dictatorships!"
"SPD only wants a contract: Tolls must strictly observe EU law, bring significant additional income, must not put additional strain on German drivers."
Newspaper reading brings some interesting insights. CSU boss Seehofer urges coalition loyalty to toll. Must he say Union friends!

The United States is now fighting against weapons captured by IS terrorists that the West itself supplied - at that time it was against Iran. Lesson from it?
"@HorstKWittig If the United States provides military aid to the oppressed, it is because the central state of Iraq, which was bombed by Bush&#39;s war, cannot do it itself."
Read &quot;There is no return certificate for German weapons&quot;. That sums up why I think arms exports to crisis areas are wrong.
"@HorstKWittig certainly a big challenge, but Martin Dulig and the Saxony SPD are doing a great election campaign, count on significant growth!"

Frank Steinmeier&#39;s clever interview on the Ukraine conflict and relations with Russia in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung!
@ _uni9 Therefore there must be a constitutional solution!
"Unfortunately, the old truth always applies: &quot;Those who cannot fight thinking fight the thinking&quot;!"
"This &quot;laughing ban&quot; for Turkish women is unfortunately not a laugh, which is intellectually ridiculous, but above all outrageously reactionary!"
@ NickWal85626091 at some point at the state and federal levels!
Reductions in future investments in education + infrastructure are not an acceptable counter-financing - additional contribution of the highest assets is!
"Debate about &quot;cold progression&quot;, that is, to be able to keep more of the salary increases, is correct if counter-financing is right!"
"I spoke to SPIEGEL that people who live, work, pay taxes and contributions are allowed to vote!"
The militarization of thought continues unabated. Why doesn&#39;t mankind learn 100 years after the start of the First World War?
Is it right that Frank Steinmeier campaigns for a lasting peace solution in Gaza. The bloodshed must finally stop!

Thrilling game and narrow defeat of brave Colombians Brazil on Tuesday opponents of the German team in the World Cup semi-finals.
"Incidentally, it&#39;s not bad at all to have intellectual pain limits - that&#39;s why some nonsense is left uncommented."
"So far, Brazil has dominated the match against the Colombians crystal clear!"
"By the way, the SPD left supports politics by Andrea Nahles as well as probably well over 90% of the SPD members - just like that. Population too!"
One only has to read the annoyed comments of the liberal-conservative market watchmen in order to correctly assess the SPD breakthrough in the minimum wage.
It is neither progressive nor left to underestimate improvements for millions of people from &quot;pure teaching&quot;. Sayings do not improve anything!
"Enforcement of the minimum wage by Andrea Nahles is a major social feat of the SPD, GroKo compromise is justifiable with transitional arrangements!"
Close victory in a dramatic game between the German team against the French. Followed with a weak stream on the ICE.
"The minimum wage is just the lid down against obvious exploitation - overall, only higher wages and salaries secure purchasing power."

"Bismarck would have considered minimum wages to be a dangerous endeavor for social democracy. Hell, how the three-class voting right is missing."
Somehow it amuses me how brazenly opponents of minimum wages and the pension package claim that they are smarter than 90% of the population!
@ Doppelgeist60 @stephandetjen Such a jump can be damn uncomfortable ;-)
"@KaiKruk No job security from publicly subsidized exploitation by dumping wages, but good work that you can live on!"
"Finally, strengthening public services and maintaining the public infrastructure of our community!"
Long-term protection of solidarity-financed social protection and a fairer distribution of income and wealth are also important!
"To this end, the SPD is fighting in the countries for more educational justice and against the liberal-conservative elitist social depreciation model."
"The minimum wage is the beginning: fight against precarious employment, securing the level of pensions, real equality, SPD has a lot to do!"
The minimum wage is a crucial social reform that visibly ends the era of the radical market spirit and its devastation.
"When I read conservative + market liberal criticism of the minimum wage that is appearing again in the media today, it emphasizes our political success!"

"@lassebecker As you know, there is everything - and the opposite. Nihil novi sub sol- nothing new under the sun ;-)"
Accept criticism of 2 years of transitional regulations on minimum wages. SPD had to enforce this minimum wage against conservatives!
"It&#39;s amazing how Siems &amp; Co. exploitation is still justified, meaning that people cannot live on wages."
"@lassebecker The topic probably does not primarily concern Berlin politics, but rather all parts of the economy and society, right ?!"
@lassebecker @hrinfo I am still frightened by messages like yesterday. Didn&#39;t become a cynic after years in politics.

No arms exports to areas of tension + states that suppress the population! Role model for development aid instead of arms export records!
The fact that the Niebel is switching directly from the Federal Security Council to the arms industry is bold: change of policy for arms exports is mandatory!
I wish everyone the Wednesday they deserve ;-)

"Neil Diamond - I Am, I Said- this is my music tip for you today ;-) http://youtu.be/PCcaP5z4xbg"
Very unfair evaluation in the &quot;Hamburger Abendblatt&quot; for the ceremony yesterday.Nord SPD and Heide Simonis do not separate anything: We are proud of Heide!
Even fully trained young people will no longer be exploited in unpaid or underpaid internships.
"Most receive minimum wages from January 1, 2015. Transitional regulation only for certain industries or collective agreements."
"From January 1st, 2017 there is an irrevocable end to the wage wages - the minimum wage covering the entire area will be adjusted regularly by the tariff partners!"
Union + economic officials wanted Swiss cheese with regional + industry exceptions. SPD prevented that! Price: 2 years transition period.
"Every day maloche for starvation wages is bad. The SPD would have preferred less in the transitional arrangement, but the fact is: 1.1.17 minimum wage for EVERYONE!"
The faction and coalition committees meet today in Kiel. I wish you all a nice Tuesday ;-)
Yesterday&#39;s honorary citizenship celebration for Heide Simonis. In the evening the late tremor victory of the World Cup team against Algerians with great strength.

"Result counts: SPD decides red lines at TTIP! Gabriel buttoned up @Ralf_Stegner, wrote @ChHickmann http://sz.de/1.2138821 ‚Äù"
"SPD party convention decides clear red lines for TTIP and CETA negotiations. Good improvements achieved, discussion was worth it!"
"SPD Party Convention decides clear requirements for TTIP + CETA: No standard reduction, no undemocratic special right, full transparency!"
Clear improvements in the SPD&#39;s proposal for TTIP and CETA in the party convention after a joint declaration by the DGB and SPD.
@martinhabersaat admittedly yes ;-) in the light it is even more attractive üòâ
"Due to a breakdown, getting to the SPD party convention in Berlin is more difficult than expected."
