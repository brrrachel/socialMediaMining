@RaabTV And whether !!!
Now get me off the field. I was very pleased with the response. Thanks for reading and writing!
@ufukccn @jonasweber :-))
Stefan Raab: Well done! We want you soon on #Twitter!
@Ralf_Stegner :-)
@Ralf_Stegner The fact that the SPD has a companion at the end of her life who is only half her age is good for her and makes her almost sexy!
"@spatzennest :-). Whatever happens, I am  erx mich impressed by Your openess  and Spirits!"
@StefanLeifert Sure?
@spatzennest How do you want to know?
@Volker_Beck @RegSprecher what does &quot;learning&quot; mean here? We already know a lot! :-)
@andredejaneiro Have a great weekend!
@ jan77hartmann was a very nice event! And the cake tasted good too!
"@sybrandbuma Thank you! Today, it is particularly beautiful and fun in Limburg because there are so many Dutch CDA friends present!"
@ ArchangelBlue58 I learned Dutch in the 1980s as a result of studying with Dutch Christian Democrats. I
"After discussions in Paris, now on the way to Kleve + St.Gerlach for nice meetings with Dutch / German friends such as @sybrandbuma!"
The horrific attack in Isere reminds us once again of the common values of Europe! All solidarity and our condolences
@jungelachse Congratulations on that! Ghosts sometimes seem to me to be the only real organisms in a completely virtual world!
"Thank you to the French friends for lively debates yesterday and today in Paris. Thank you to JP Jouyet, the Montaigne Institute and the Embassy!"
@ young axis unmistakable! :-))
@MTaege And whether: look at forecasts from OECD and others.
"@ kalib1962 That was the tweet of your life, because from now on you are blocked. :-("
@TIMECODEX Not really!
@MdB_Stroebele 1) But something like that! 2) I&#39;m not so sure. 3) Have you guessed it before you had cult status?
"@MdB_Stroebele We were both together in the PKGr. Since I have been in the Chancellery, I have been concerned with the functionality of the services AND education!"
"@a__s_r @jreichelt Personal reductions show weakness and lack of sovereignty. For the rest, US green cards are in high demand!"
@TIMECODEX @MdB_Stroebele believe it or not: I&#39;m also part of Parliament!
@ hope_no1 @tirsales @KonstantinNotz I still don&#39;t know what should be wrong with this quote !!!
@Kanzlerpark :-)
@neythomas @padeluun @KonstantinNotz Both are binding and you have to look for a gentle balance.
"@RicoRiccsn That makes the decisive legal difference, even if it is the same person."
"@RicoRiccsn The UA may propose. BReg then sets in. The UA knows classified docs, but may not publish them."
"@RicoRiccsn Nobody does. But since BReg Ausl. Dok&#39;s must not be passed on without permission, you have to find a solution that does justice to both sides."
"@RicoRiccsn Yes, I did. They also?"
@KasperLusche @sch But something like that!
@flueke Only if you are not careful! :-)
By the way: # Strawberry Cake was the most successful tweet ever! This shows that man does not live on bread alone ...
@MdB_Stroebele Propose it officially and I&#39;ll be there !! :-)) And the enlightenment would also benefit!
@armselig :-)
"@danielmack was good, but the @Volker_Beck is not getting any younger!"
"It was very, very nice tonight. Now get me off the field. Read you!"
@josh_k_phisher @KonstantinNotz Ja.
"@orangesolar Yes, it is, but when I left it was 3,500 MW, which is very good."
@ThomasSchuback @dneuerer @MdB_Stroebele I should also protect your security! And I take my oath very seriously!
@RAStadler Likewise! We have argued properly before! :-)
@NordicEcki @flueke You don&#39;t believe how many sausages have been sent to me in the last few days! :-)
@orangesolar The expansion of wind onshore exceeds all records
@RAStadler @KonstantinNotz Exactly that.
@ flueke Sure thing: strawberry cake and sausages! Real life :-))
"@RAStadler The offer of the confidant makes it clear that we decide, nobody else."
@flueke @KonstantinNotz I would be very happy if I could discuss it with the opposition. But she&#39;s sulking right now :-)
"@hc_s @KonstantinNotz You&#39;re wrong with GsD: Political disenchantment does not increase, it decreases! After all surveys."
@DerLaxx @KonstantinNotz No. But other deals.
@johannesvogel Greetings from Berlin! Have just duplicated our joint work on Hartz IV reform. And in the evening with young FDP MPs
@tirsales @KonstantinNotz No.No.
"@Kanzlerpark Of course! Today I praised the beautiful park at a meeting, but also referred to its problems."
@Raider_MXD Good idea! Wednn who participates in @KonstantinNotz ...
@KonstantinNotz I don&#39;t think so. We are accommodating Parliament as far as is in any way compatible with international law.
@KonstantinNotz 2/2 Whether this is not the case can only be judged if the opposition has at least tried.
"@KonstantinNotz It does not need a legal basis, because: A confidant is better / more than NOT a confidant. 1.2"
@orangesolar But you already know that I will no longer answer you! :-)
@Dandii @KonstantinNotz And yet we have to respect international law. We expect the same from other countries. Like me you like me
"@flueke What is so rumored. In any case, we have made our offer and it is valuable."
"@Herr_Decker You can see from this that we are serious. By the way, the opposition could make its own suggestions regarding the person and the mandate."
"@ DennisP78 So far I have not done any interviews about it. Strawberry pie is tempting, but it needs to be carefully considered."
"@KonstantinNotz Trusted person is in accordance with constitutional and international law. If the opposition boycots, their chances in Karlsruhe decrease."
@ Chancellor Park That would be more of a &quot;nursing exit&quot;!
@flueke How long have we been acting on the basis of press reports? Our proposal is very accommodating to Parliament and is meant seriously.
@sekor @tagesschau Maybe the suggestion with the confidant wasn&#39;t that bad ...
@PiratNrw I don&#39;t know. At Jauch I said that the G7 summit takes care of climate issues. Nobody was interested. But that&#39;s exactly how it was
@flueke :-)
@freddibecker @ProSieben clearly!
"@petertauber @BruneKerstin if this continues, sausages will be the new currency on the net! Bitcoin was yesterday!"
"@ PsychoTR0N @Torgator We are taking in a lot: around 200,000 from Africa and the Middle East this year"
@ziesmannmedia @frankzimmer @ walli5 @OlafKolbrueck Debreziner definitely. You can also find it in the BT canteen.
"@Ralf_Stegner If you personally support @sigmargabriel u @HeikoMaas with a brilliant speech, it just has to go well! :-)"
@Ralf_Stegner Then I&#39;m reassured! :-)
@RobertRossmann @Ralf_Stegner At least!
@Ralf_Stegner How are you doing?
@LOB_Controls I leave that to you. Reforms in Greece are desperately needed if Greece wants to remain a member of the euro zone.
@ytzen @bertusbouwman Thanks!
@BjoernFr :-))
@bertusbouwman Of course you would like that! :-) But to talk good Dutch you have to think in Dutch! That used to be possible
"@jreichelt Fears you mess things up, but others do too. But such debates should not a. Twitter run"
"@Torgator But that also shows that Europe is not just a fortress, but also helps people in need."
@flueke Bon appetit!
"Dear @jreichelt, we do not comment on newspaper reports on committee issues. # AusGr√ºnden"
"@flueke Anyway, they&#39;re famous for their dill, pepper and vanilla ice cream!"
@flueke yes (k) sees one! :-)) You probably too !!! :-))
@ DennisP78 who are you?
Now do me off the field. Was exciting today. not just the sausages. #VDS
@ uncover007 And if I understand that. But I don&#39;t submit to it! :-)
"@ uncover007 As I said: I only speak to you when I know who you are. As I you, so you me!"
@flueke @ronpatz sounds promising! Good night!
@Azrooth The SPD could decide to completely save everything. Without changing anything about the pirates.
@ronpatz @flueke It could have been worse! Have you ever tried lentil soup with plum cake? That&#39;s actually there!
@ uncover007 @flueke What are you like? Twittering is bad with avatars!
@flueke :-))
"@sven_kindler The principle is not controversial, only when it works! Let&#39;s fight for the cause together!"
@CIA_BND_Gehlen Attention! Can you treat others with respect? So far not the impression!
@sven_kindler Thank you for a factual discussion at the HHA. It will be really difficult. But the climate is right (especially after Elmau!)
@t_truthhh Welcome to Twitter!
@HRFortmann :-))
Great atmosphere at the @BVDW network policy evening! Who if not yours! Let&#39;s start up!
"@spdfrakwandsbek Moin, nice that you follow me! On good terms with each other!"
@DR_politisch @WDR Many greetings and thanks to the CDU Rosenthal !!
"@ tr_official09 where I am, it is very nice !!! Strikingly cheerful :-)"
@rutziporiu Never !!! :-)
"@KonstantinNotz @jreichelt In order to have such discussions, the content of the selectors doesn&#39;t even matter ..."
"@presroi @jreichelt If false reports like today in the mirror about meetings Gabriel, Altmaier, Vassiliadis would be excluded ..."
@jreichelt @KonstantinNotz Wg. Interest: Did Uhrlau quote from the MoA?
@jreichelt @Doener @KonstantinNotz Not quite!
@jreichelt @KonstantinNotz The MoA is known to be top secret. And you don&#39;t want to incite me to commit a crime? :-)
@JochenFromm The Chancellery works (almost) always !!! :-)
"@offpulse Well, you are never sure of a tweet! Especially when a minister dynamically breaks out of the undergrowth with his bike :-)!"
@thorstenreschke not at all; just couldn&#39;t look so fast!
". @ thorstenreschke Yes, a very isolated but happy Chancellor Minister with his bike on the way to work! :-)"
"@LemgoWind So, so: Do you mean that I have so intensively promoted the energy transition as the most important project since the reconstruction?"
@peter_simone @RobertRossmann :-))
@ahborchers :-)))
@RobertRossmann you are a philosopher !!!
@NicDiek Tja: sports & politics! :-)
@NicDiek :-)) At least!
It has always been this way at HSV: what can go wrong goes wrong! But then the one moment that lasts for 20 years !! Congratulation !
@ethevessen @ThomasWalde We have been hearing this for months: But so far it has been prevented. The commitment to reason is worthwhile.
"@TiloJung @JungNaiv Yes, that&#39;s right, we still have a date open."
"@ThomasWalde Oh, and how about &quot;US weapons&quot; for Ukraine? Who was right at the time with his assessment?"
@victor5679 :-))
@ThomasWalde Perhaps this is because confidential matters should be discussed where they belong: in the BT&#39;s NSA-UA
"@ThomasWalde I have been standing up for years of discussion - even if the &quot;critics&quot; were completely wrong, as with &quot;US weapons for Ukraine&quot;."
Congratulations to all 950 new masters at the HWK D√ºsseldorf! Was great with you!
@FelixLeonhardt I have been living this maxim with enthusiasm for decades! :-)
@FelixLeonhardt :-)))))
@MrZeabird @flueke @TiloJung This is not an opinion but a legal question. And to be answered by those who are called to do so.
@TinaSchwarzer What takes a long time ...
@ hannig1758 Then congratulations and cheers! :-)
@hildwin G√§hn! :-)
. @ schroeder_k @sis_taz @SPIEGELONLINE That is easy to understand: &#39;I had not eaten anything since breakfast! :-)
@quovadisschland maybe that&#39;s what you mean! :-)
@RaabTV :-))
@FlorianGathmann @nminkmar @robinalexander_ @Schmidtlepp But something like that!
@ express24 But something of! :-)
Only 2! ‚Äú@Robinalexander_: The bad news: ChefBK @peteraltmaier was bugged. The good one: He still has time for 2 or 3 sausages
"@Thomaschke :-)) ... Incidentally, there were only two ... :-)"
@favkraft :-)
@Schmidtlepp :-))
"Just see that @Schmidtlepp has a birthday just one day after me! Congratulation! .,. And of course: # strawberry cake!"
@cybraner at least! :-)
@tanjafoehr :-))
"The human head is very special: the more you have put in, the more you can fit in !!!!"
@GrimmLeonhard Always at work! :-)
@GrimmLeonhard Thank you! Best regards to Munich!
@ Doc_57 thank you!
@bratfischzurem :-))
@bratfischzurem Stefan Raab is intergalactic and has many fans abroad (and I have many foreign followers on Twitter)
@Herr_Decker Well learned from the strawberry cake? !! :-)
@Kaffeerappel Should also be &quot;on&quot; #auto correction!
@ young axis is really an offer! :-)
@Dave_Kay Dementi BPA and BMWi is already out. We will adhere to the climate targets. But how is still open.
"Well, @Dave_Kay &#39;net duck again? :-)"
"@USieberg @FRonline @bund_net @HubertWeiger climate chancellor was never gone! Backloading, energy transition goes ahead, climate target is met!"
"@Muenzhandel_DD man, that you still think of me! I had the part silvered again, it became super beautiful! Greetings from Berlin!"
@luebberding :-))
"@luebberding ... and with other non-democracies too. In the matter I was very clear, just didn&#39;t offend anyone ... :-)"
"@luebberding Yes, I talked well about Eladly. But clearly said that we have to work with Egypt, although it was never democracy."
@ benrol61 It was not that rare! #Strawberrycake :-)
"@jreichelt Well, and now?"
"@gutjahr how do you want to know that Germans are &quot;being spied on, and then during my term in office?"
@ConradPfeffer That&#39;s right! :-)) And what the young CDU and Greens discussed 20 years ago was and is secret!
@ Gutjahr Again: What is wrong with my statement at the time? It is also my job to ensure that it stays that way.
@gutjahr And whether! And I don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with it in the least!
"@LongoFL I personally discussed this in 3 years with about 150,000 people and reached many millions via TV, radio and press. And you?"
Right! It&#39;s great that you recognized me despite the bike! https://twitter.com/jonasweber/status/605817839107239939‚Ä¶
@cleanenergywire unfortunately no fantasy numbers. And the Groko has now changed the EEG and the red-green countries have not blocked!
@Marlies_Uken @LongoFL And I stood behind it myself: until today!
"@LongoFL @dom_kauf @zeitonline @Marlies_Uken As is well known, all red / green federal states have agreed to this amendment!"
@flueke @TheRealNimoy @atsipras :-)
"@ walli5 So, so. But who should I troll? Are all current or future coalition partners!"
@Meseberg @flueke At least!
"@flueke Turtled moon landing, Cheops pyramid as transmitter, Elvis lives, Daeniken, Roswell incident: conspiracy theories always work!"
@flueke conspiracy theories are the change of the journalist! :-)
"@flueke everything ok, there again"
@flueke Could a tweet have just disappeared? #Release BPK
@DKluever And if I do that! It&#39;s just a secret!
@deWindvogel What you do is important for promoting sustainability. In Berlin I will be able to help you meet suitable people.
@deWindvogel Who are you and what do you do?
@DickElk @deWindvogel @apvermeulen :-))
"@apvermeulen @deWindvogel Could be better. Unfortunately, there is a bit of practice missing!"
"@deWindvogel In our country, the percentage of renewable electricity is AL 27%! In the Netherlands it is now also going up!"
"@KonstantinNotz If not instead, for what? :-)"
". @ KonstantinNotz @jreichelt @flueke&#39;s ideas keep getting better! Witness, expert, government representative, parliamentarian in one person!"
@andredejaneiro :-)
@LevinFischer @SZ That eats exciting! But I&#39;ve cracked harder nuts! Happy Pentecost!
"@ hanspschmidt1 Neuforweiler, St.Barbara, Felsberg!"
@andredejaneiro especially since you also speak Dutch !!
@ PsychoTR0N Sure! Don&#39;t we know each other from before?
@Reffeff Schaun &#39;Check it out: Twitter is full of it!
@hildwin @flueke :-))
@ChristianMoebus Better late than never !!!
@AhrensSylvie definitely strawberry cake! :-)
strawberrycake
"@ cotillo1 Oh what, you know where I am ... :-)"
@LaviniaSt @flueke :-))
@ronpatz @flueke :-)) He&#39;ll also tweet when nobody knows what Facebook used to be!
You have to leave @flueke: He tweets in real time 24/7!
@MKreutzfeldt @welt Sure: it&#39;s just a hard loaf ...
@flueke Bon weekend!
@andredejaneiro Beautiful! That was an excellent choice. Nice weekend!

@andredejaneiro do you speak Dutch? Where did you learn that?
"@Histrius Oh what, the best judgments are still the prejudices! :-)"
@Histrius :-))
@Histrius Your tweets are pure acumen !!!!!!!
"@SebSwo you have something to do with them, and who are you?"
"@sooffy It is very different: if I tweet myself, I get tweeted more often and also try to answer."
@BjoernFr Not at all! Sigmar Gabriel and Heiko Maas are not against it either!
@HolgerScherer @express24 Indeed! :-)
@ytzen @bertusbouwman Congratulations! I intended to regularly tweet in Dutch ... but it almost never works!
@Tony_Cavallaro @schroeder_k @sis_taz @SPIEGELONLINE Good thing that someone finally said! :-)
"@BjoernFr Well, you might be submitting things to me! :-) I&#39;m very reluctant to #VDS (but I keep my fingers crossed for Heiko Maas)"
