My opinion on Macron&#39;s visit to the European Parliament: http://goo.gl/duKBuf #MacronEP
#MacronEP is not completely vague about Nord Stream 2. He shares the concerns (&quot;share concerns&quot;) that it is a &quot;sensitive&quot; project. Europe must not lose any ground in energy sovereignty. Then he pans to general energy policy. # NordStream2
#MacronEP advocates &quot;consistent&quot; trade policy; it must protect workers&#39; and environmental protection standards and health goals.
"#MacronEP now says he likes the top candidate system; it is progress; but transnational lists, led by top candidates, would be even better. (I think so too.) Because he is not part of an EU party family, he does not feel bound."
#MacronEP also has a solution for all # Brexit problems: stay a member! There will be no cherry picking.
"#MacronEP wants its own EU agency on refugee policy, which financially supports municipalities that accept refugees."
"According to the catch-the-eye method, numerous MEPs ask Macron one-minute questions each. It&#39;s my turn too; My topic: Nors Stream 2. I&#39;m looking forward to the answer. Had recently heard in DC that France was rethinking its stance on the project. #MacronEP"
#MacronEP emphatically defends French Syria policy. The three countries that bombed Syria represented the &quot;honor of the international community&quot;.
Macron also criticizes Manfred Weber for his top candidate plea. Perhaps he could imagine top candidates if there were transnational lists. #MacronEP

"#Timmermans is the first to respond to #Rutte and demonstrates that Dutch people can also be emotional. Complains that, unlike all of his predecessors, President Trump is interested in a divided Europe."
"#Rutte&#39;s clear words on the &quot;rule of law in all member states&quot;. Applause from those present. - There is hardly a seat in the right third of the EP. - EP answers Rutte&#39;s speech with a slow, inconsistent standing ovation."
"#Rutte to #Eurozone: If everyone tidies up at home, everything is OK. Mention ESM + EU budget as a tool to help where it is really necessary. Message: No new steps for the euro zone! Declaration of war on Macron / Merkel / Juncker. After that he wants to lower the EU budget. OMG!"
"First applause for #Rutte in the EP because he supports climate protection for a CO2 reduction of 55% by 2030. Nobody claps to the right, of course."
"Dutch Prime Minister #Rutte talks about his European performance in the EP. Core sentence: &quot;The limitation shows the championship.&quot; He stressed the &quot;sovereign member countries&quot;, the Europe of the citizens does not exist. Nor is social Europe."

It seems that the new Saxon CDU Prime Minister #Kretschmer in #Ostritz has demonstrated insights into working together against neo-Nazis that his predecessors did not have.

And.
&quot;A member of the Union puts it this way: The European chapter in the coalition agreement is essentially little more than &#39;poetry&#39; that does not commit to anything.&quot; (From: The time)
To Bullmann (S&amp;D) #MacronEP said: I did not speak of the Franco-German axis; it is sufficient if there is a certain minimal understanding with Germany. - This is how Berlin can be rebuked given the blockades there.
"Philippe Lamberts speaks for Greens / EFA Group: We share many of Macron&#39;s European visions. But he did not realize these visions in France: where is there brotherhood, freedom, solidarity? #MacronEP"

Manfred Weber emphasizes in debate with Macron&#39;s top candidate model for 2019.
"Juncker cleverly replies to Macron. Praise him. Then he emphasizes a) no further east-west division, b) Europe&#39;s design needs the participation of all member countries, c) we have to open up to the Western Balkans."
Macron did not address Berlin directly. But indirectly his message to Merkel was clear: I will go on; You can try to defend a Europe that goes on and on. I&#39;m not going to give in. #MacronEP
"#MacronEP: &quot;Against a Europe of navel gazing, against a Europe of the way forward, for a Europe of sovereignty.&quot;"
"#MacronEP: I don&#39;t want to belong to a generation that forgets history, but one who is committed to its own democracy, because this democracy is the fruit of past battles."
"#MacronEP: Demonstrates a case history of &quot;European sovereignties&quot;, with which he apparently wants to lay an argumentative basis for a stronger Europeanization of politics. Interesting try."
"#MacronEP: After all, climate and energy still occur. Pleads for carbon floor price."
"#MacronEP: Promotes &quot;European sovereignty&quot;. We &quot;need&quot; important results before the European elections. (Berlin, do you hear?) Calls refugee policy, banking union, taxation of digital companies, more EU own resources, more convergence of the euro zone."
#MacronEP: Lively campaigns for &quot;lively European debate&quot; ahead of the European elections &quot;Get out of the simple yes / no.&quot;
"The major challenges of today, which #MacronEP mentions at the beginning of his speech, only lack the - ecological."
"#MacronEP speaks of the &quot;illiberal fascination&quot;, of &quot;geopolitical challenges&quot;, of questioning the &quot;cornerstones of industrial society&quot;. Emphasizes: &quot;Not authoritarian democracy, but authority through democracy.&quot;"
