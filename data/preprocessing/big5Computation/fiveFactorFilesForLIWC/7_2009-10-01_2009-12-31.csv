@shz_de Already forgotten? Kubicki wanted to lower the tax for high earners by increasing the VAT of small earners!
Moin from SH.Rainful departure to Berlin.#@tweet_music today: Barclay James Harvest &quot;Berlin&quot;. Nice Monday!
RT @hensch: One wonders where Wolfgang Kubicki was when the FDP election program was adopted.

"Nobody from SH in the Federal Cabinet: No wonder, because the North CDU has zero influence in Berlin.Kieler Kabinett with PHC, Wiegard + Schlie = level problem"
Black-yellow cabinet SH without any future orientation. Black-yellow in the federal government on social reduction course in health unsocial head allowance!
Moin from SH.Today at Jusos in Uelzen. # @ tweet_music Nilsson &quot;Daybreak&quot;. Have a nice Weekend!
Anti-social head allowance for health and care. Black and yellow now presents citizens with the receipt for the election result!
Factional exam well completed. Equipped with a newly elected management team and a new work structure for powerful opposition. # SPD ++
Group elections in progress.

"Discussion in Segeberg much more constructive than yesterday in Kiel, as with Jusos and Neumuenster: critical, factual, clear + solidarity: good!"
"Black and yellow wants a flat rate per head instead of solidary long-term care insurance, but the mask is falling: shadow cabinet + shadow household!"
Black coffers and chicken tricks first act of black-yellow! Tax cuts for high-earners and companies: people pay colliery!
@aristokitten not to be expected but thanks anyway!
"Moin from SH.Today&#39;s party discussion in KVSegeberg, plus consultation hour in Bordesholm. # @ Tweet_music: Bryan Adams &quot;Straight from the heart&quot;."

Wonderful autumn day here in the north. Relax again before a normal working week with a group meeting and party appointments.
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Enya &quot;Wild child&quot;. Have a beautiful Sunday!
HSV-Leverkusen not yet the hit: 0-0 so far after 57 minutes!
Bad for SH.Gut for committed opposition to a coalition that did not even get the majority of the votes!
"For this, Wiegard should be demoted to HSH supervision but still be ministrabel?! There could have been nun makers in the cabinet!"
"In terms of personnel, the coalition is the oath of disclosure: the right wing fails for 4 years, deJager fails at UKSH: wages = ministerial office.Women ???"
"Kiel coalition agreement of black and yellow promises five years lost for SH.Rueckwaerts at Bildung + Atom, no bearing on HSH and budget"
Moin from Heringsdorf. Departure from the beautiful and hospitable island of Usedom. # @ tweet_music today: Gianna Nannini &quot;I maschi&quot; .CU!
After all the storm days today a quiet Usedom day. Everything that was relaxed today! Tomorrow back to SH!
@PoliticsMedia safe!
Moin from Heringsdorf / Usedom. Wet gray Friday.#@tweet_music today: Al Stewart &quot;Time passages&quot;. Have a nice Weekend!
The black and yellow fashion is quickly fading and Jamaica is an expensive vacation trip and you need plenty of rum to endure this in the long run!
are again in obituaries to the SPD and as always they are wrong this time. The SPD is needed and will come again ... soon !!
Nice island day in spite of stormy weather with walks and other recreational joys. Black and yellow makes social and the zeitgeist
Moin from Usedom.#@tweet_music today: Status quo &quot;Living on an island&quot;. Nice Thursday! Argentina creates World Cup! Switzerland too!

Interesting TAZ commentary on the Saar: &quot;Swap credibility for power&quot;.
Moin from SH. # @ tweet_music today to go with the Saar: Knut Kiesewetter &quot;Drive down the river with me&quot;. Nice beginning of the week everyone!
RT @Frau_Elise: You just blasphemy. I think the Folkerts are great.
Republic is moving ever more to the right. Now it is important to regain trust with future concepts so that a shift to the right is not permanent
"Mayor election won in Ahrensburg, unfortunately just barely lost in Kappeln!"
"We have to reflect on our own strength. Justice, freedom and solidarity are more topical than ever."
The path to social modernity must be developed and prepared. SPD must be prepared to have few allies in the process! SPD ++
"RT @conum: ... every people gets the government they deserve, that&#39;s too bleak for me!"
This policy must be countered by concepts that are more social and fairer. End-large coalitions offer opportunities for new trust!
"Little for many and a lot for few, that&#39;s the philosophy from Berlin to Saarbruecken, from Hamburg to Stuttgart, from Kiel to Wiesbaden!"
All that remains is a consistent opposition policy against the various high-income coalitions and committed work for social modernity!
A shame for the Saarland and a shame who is chasing after the black and yellow coalition of power and money - the higher earners are happy!
"If you think that you can make better policies for the future with Mueller + FDP than with Heiko Maas, you also believe in Santa Claus!"
Jamaica on the Saar is the last triumph for OskarLafontaine and was expected after the development in Thuringia and the Lafontaine coup!
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Dire Straits &quot;Walk of life&quot;. Happy Sunday everyone!
RT @LN_Online: 1: 0 Klose !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great move!
Rainy day to watch football: Russians stronger than Germans so far. Later onion cake eating with friends!
"Overall, the SPD must not fixate itself on other parties, neither positive nor negative, Lafontaine is no longer important to us!"
remain major obstacle in the federal government and Lafontaine decision probably motivated to make life difficult for Heiko Maas + to promote Jamaica
"Lafontaine&#39;s retreat from the top of the parliamentary group in Berlin makes things easier - nobody cries tears for him, but still: foreign policy differences"

Good and exciting discussion with the Jusos at the red weekend in Schleswig. Important impulses for SPD!

Moin from SH. # @ tweet_music today Roy Orbison &quot;Crying&quot;. Nice Friday!
"The first round of discussions in Neumuenster was interesting and rather encouraging - open, direct and very different from the attacks launched by the media."
On the way to Neumuenster to start talks with the district associations and local associations after the election disaster from 27.9. in bundle + SH.
"Members want to be heard and discuss and no vain via media &quot;thought leaders&quot;, night treaders or know-it-alls since election day 6.01pm!"
"Talks with colleagues from the parliamentary groups again in the evening in Neumuenster, starting the intensive discussion tour through all district associations."

@danielbaer and
"On the way to Koeln to the Jusos, a lecture at the university and then to the Ebert Foundation in Bonn."
Most members discuss the future of the SPD in a constructive and committed manner. The media letter writers reveal a lot about themselves!
"A few of our 20,000 members with media access write me so-called &quot;open&quot; letters. Only via the media + to large distributors + objectively."
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Billy Swan &quot;I can help&quot;. Happy Thursday everyone!

Ecumenical worship and constituent session of the state parliament. Democracy is a great achievement: a good day in this spirit!
@LeaMaria everyone likes it!
@danielmack with its own programmatic profile that does not chase other parties!

Great article at Sueddeutsche.de on the Federal Council decision: Thorsten Denkler &quot;Merkel&#39;s new bed mat Carstensen in the tax dispute&quot;
RT @ thorbengeyer @ KurtBeck comments Carstensen&#39;s behavior on the growth acceleration law with a poem - http://j.mp/8Swkh6
RT @shz_de: Schleswig-Holstein has thus joined the other black and yellow governed countries. # TotalschadenfuerSH
"Angela Merkel shows Carstensen &amp; Kubicki that they are amateur league, belly landing for North Frisian paper tigers and big mouths from the Foerde!"
RT @shz_de: Beck criticizes Carstensen&#39;s shift in opinion. We unfortunately know the gentleman and knew that before!
In SH special bonuses for HSH bankers and supply posts as agents for medium-sized party fans in Berlin tricked by Merkel!
Carstensen &amp; Kubicki put party interest above the national welfare: million damage for SH by extra giveaway for rich heirs and hoteliers!
RT @KurtBeck: Big fight today in the Federal Council: The senseless tax cut must be prevented! Unfortunately Carstensen fell over!
Moin from SH on Friday before Christmas.#@tweet_music today especially for Carstensen and Merkel: Slade &quot;Mama we&#39;re all crazy now&quot;.
Good day for the SPD in the state parliament. Great snow landscape in front of the plenary hall on the Foerde.
Lousy performance of black and yellow in the state debate on tax gifts for the rich and the education hill. # FremdschaemenfuerPHC &amp; Kubicki!
Today state debates on the #debt acceleration law and yesterday&#39;s #education mole heap. Black and yellow in top form!
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music suitable for the snow today: Queen &quot;Thank God it&#39;s Christmas&quot;. Nice day everyone!
Back from the group&#39;s moody Christmas party.
"RT @macava: Christmas party of the SPD parliamentary group #landtag #nrw # is running, that&#39;s also the case in SH!"
"Angie could have offered the two of them a place for the good performance on the 3rd Advent, but she probably didn&#39;t like the mouthguard!"
"SH will agree to the #debt acceleration law in the Federal Council, so Carstensen &amp; Kubicki got chestnuts out of fire for Merkel - great!"
"Carstensen &amp; Kubicki make SH ridiculous nationwide and still brag, they would have taken fire for other chestnuts - unfortunately not for SH!"
Start of the three-day session of the state parliament in Kiel today. Question time about the Marnette diary and much more.
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Chris Rea &quot;Josephine&quot;. Nice Wednesday!
