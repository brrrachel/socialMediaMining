Remarkable &quot;unveiling&quot; by BDI President Kempf on the discussion about Altmaier&#39;s national industrial strategy: There is already a first date to talk about it with the Minister of Economic Affairs. Ojoijoi! # WIFO19
"#Altmaier claims a German leadership role for Europe&#39;s industrial policy, partly because other EU countries are industrially weak. All in all quite reasoned. He defends his Siemens Alstom position well. And he was not a planned economist. Good to know! # WIFO19"
Altmaier responds to the criticism of his national industrial strategy by turning to the basics and emphasizing that politics must take responsibility for &quot;prosperity for all&quot;. He is halfway to the primacy of politics. # WIFO19
"#Altmaier starts his impulse somewhat riotously. For example, he thinks that there is too much discussion in Germany about business ethics. Then he criticizes those who think that the R&amp;D departments of car companies &amp; business logic alone can secure the future of the industry. # WIFO19 pic.twitter.com/vP5yqLZOVg"
"The main contribution of # SPD Prime Minister Weil to the Economic Forum? Well, the General Data Protection Regulation as &quot;shotgun shot&quot; and &quot;not the yellow of the egg&quot; madden. And emphasize the healthy self-confidence of the &quot;leading automotive industry&quot;. A beacon of hope! # WIFO19"
Now #Oettinger has an &quot;idea&quot;: retirement at 70! I would have preferred a few daring rhetorical escapades. # WIFO19

"... therefore, every opinion that a member of parliament represents should be attributed to the party. Especially not when the party - do you remember? - represents the opposite position."
... nevertheless it is unfair to carry out the equation that is so important to you. The fact that deputies can have their own opinion can be attributed to the Greens. And then choose a party that doesn&#39;t allow such freedom. But you can&#39;t ...
"That&#39;s right, we, more precisely: the Federal Assembly of Delegates, have drawn up MEPs. But not on the condition that nobody should ever deviate. That would be the &quot;imperative mandate&quot; that greens had many supporters at the beginning, but was then rejected ..."
That is not a serious argument. Freedom of conscience shouldn&#39;t be overemphasized where it doesn&#39;t suit you?

"Do you want to play in the hand of those who are in charge today in RUS because you don&#39;t know who will be in charge of the UKR in the future? I tell you: If it goes to Putin, it will be him. This is a good reason not to undermine the UKR&#39;s resilience."
"You didn&#39;t understand it. I&#39;ll explain it more simply: Gazprom gas, which is supplied via the Baltic Sea instead of via Ukraine, does not create an additional supplier and has nothing to do with diversification."
"There is no additional supplier if monopolist Gazprom eliminates Ukraine as a transit country. And &quot;we&quot;, we Europeans, worsen our situation if RUS can more easily threaten the security of the UKR, if Baltic countries, POL or DEN fear for their security."
"It shreds: According to #Altmaier, Germany &quot;has only had positive experiences in #gas trading with Russia for 40 years&quot;. Well, the Soviets were pretty reliable; but #Putin? Wasn&#39;t there something in 2006 &amp; 2009? Does the CDU Federal Minister have to gloss over Russian politics?"

This is a special treat! Yang Jiechi lectures to the U.S. not to lecture to the Europeans! And then he preaches the gospel of #Huawei according to Saint Yang! #MSC
"#Yang Jiechi: ""China respects human rights. All ethnic groups cooperate peacefully in China."" As is being proven in the #Uighur camps in #Xinjiang every day, I assume. Self-confident cynicism at its best! #MSC"
"Our think tanks should spare no efforts to help de-constructing the core concepts of Chinese foreign policy. Like ""community of shared future for mankind"". For me that translates to: ""only such goals & values are acceptable in international relations that #China agrees to"". #MSC"
#Yang Jiechi: China objects to South China Sea FONOPs missions in order to defend its souvereignty. - The vague claim of souvereignty in the South #China Sea is designed to allow China maximum flexibility in pushing its assertive security policy. #MSC
"#Yang Jiechi, China's foreign policy czar, reads a speech full of Xi Jinping language. Switches to English and indirectly expresses hope of US-CN #trade war compromise. And, of course, #China supports European unity. I'd say: CN loves EU so much, it prefers 2 have 2 of them. #MSC"

Do you only remember the chorus of the whole TTIP debate? Just think of the difference between REACH and TSCA.

Greens are against the import of shale gas (as well as against fracking in the EU). For a long time. US gas or RUS gas is not the alternative. Don&#39;t be fooled by the propaganda that we cannot reduce gas dependency altogether.
