@ butzeb1979 I am quite clearly of the opinion that Merkel usually lacks a political compass
@ butzeb1979 I&#39;ll finish it. You have referred to a tweet as &quot;baiting&quot; and are now refusing to explain it. Pity!
"On the way to #Berlin, #Session week"
@ butzeb1979 We were not at all in the general evaluation. But you should be much more careful with the term &quot;baiting&quot;
"@ butzeb1979 The question was, how do you get it that &quot;missing political compass&quot; is agitation. You mix things up with it"
"@ butzeb1979 Please answer my question first, then I will answer your question"
@ butzeb1979 But now you are miles away. To accuse someone of lacking the political compass is hardly &quot;baiting&quot;

It&#39;s a good thing that the cartel office is already taking a close look at Amazon. This behavior harms consumers https://twitter.com/spiegelonline/status/649840546559733760…
@Sabine_Baetzing Welcome back to Berlin
Has the @ArminLaschet stopped? Where is his assessment of the success of NRW / @ HanneloreKraft Local Transport Financing pic.twitter.com/qUKeIwekOD
The federal government has now agreed on all important points and now speaks with one voice :-) pic.twitter.com/fVdCuGxHHS
This is how the SPD&#39;s &quot;digital policy program&quot; for the Federal Party Congress in December looks like #DigitalLeben
"CDU-MdB Pfeiffer clears the lack of transparency from @campact, @foodwatch_de etc. #Factscheck He is against a transparency register for lobbyists"
@ArminLaschet I&#39;m still waiting for your assessment of the NRW&#39;s success in regionalization funds
". @ cducsubt always attack SPD-led states. Unfair, we cannot attack CDU-led countries, there are hardly any :-)"
@ Ariakan79 The &quot;South Tangent&quot; will not come. Better new road / rail bridge at Wesseling
"@ Ariakan79 Planning ahead, checking environmental compatibility, planning, citizen participation, building design, securing finances, building"
"Hello @ArminLaschet, Brandenburger CDU complained that NRW / @ HanneloreKraft had won too much money for local transport. What do you say?"
"@ Ariakan79 But then after 2030, it wouldn&#39;t come any faster. But before that, Ennert and Kottenforst and its surroundings would be damaged"
"Refugees in Bonn: Urban employees, aid organizations and volunteers do a fantastic job http://www.rundschau-online.de/bonn/fluechtlinge-in-bonn-weiter-gebaeude-fuer-unterlassung-gesucht,15185502,32043376.html ..."
"13,000 signatures against the &quot;Südtangente&quot;, great commitment of the citizens&#39; initiatives http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/beuel/beuel-ost/13-000-Unterschriften- Gegen-die-Suedtangente-article1734449.html…"
@Tim_Acht Neither you nor I know what the order was.
"@JustusLiebig Either as a flat rate with 1.5% of the list value, or pointedly or with MdB / State Secretary with a fixed amount"
"Dear @JoachimStamp, the point is that you cannot criticize what you are doing in #Bonn #Ground Tax as an opposition in Düsseldorf"
@JoachimStamp @FDPFraktionNRW Extract from the municipal code: The city council decides on the budget and the amount of local taxes
@JoachimStamp @FDPFraktionNRW you burden all tenants and owners. Each year
"Unfortunately not only on this topic. Always the fast headline, without a concept for complex problems https://twitter.com/spdrlp/status/677156945950810112…"
"In the Düsseldorf Landtag @FDPFraktionNRW against increase in real estate transfer tax, in the Council #Bonn for more expensive increase in real estate tax. implausible"
&quot;Bad Day&quot; of course. #SPD is definitely proud that we have been able to end the German blockade against more data protection in Europe over many years
The CDU / CSU group leader in the EP considers #dsgvo a success. Colleagues from the Bundestag and EP say &quot;Bad das&quot;. Without a line! pic.twitter.com/I8rh6zbzA6
@_clairegrube @ manullo41 With this Left Party Bundestag faction coalition would have long since broken and the EU would have failed
@_clairegrube @ manullo41 Such claims of absoluteness do not advance a society. And never get a majority !!!
