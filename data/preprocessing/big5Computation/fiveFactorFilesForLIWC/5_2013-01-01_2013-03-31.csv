Good night :-( # absolute majority
@springfeld not mine
It is also significant that BM Rösler skips the Bundestag debate on energy prices
@deppentoeter so it is
"Electricity debate absurd: coalition deputies &quot;we demand&quot;, &quot;we will&quot;, &quot;one should&quot;. Psssst, you are government, after all, 180 days!"
@teresniak @cofi_juwi It provides at least one statement ...
This is how it looks http://www.spdfraktion.de/elli-verdient-mehr/elli-01.html… #equalpayday
"@silkherrmann Real, we have a maximum of 20 centimeters"
"@CoFi_juwi takes place, but Chancellor suggests that nothing be decided today. Red-green will propose a resolution"
"@danielbaer 1. Reform EEG levy formation, EEG electricity is sold. 2. Retract exceptions. 3. Lower individual remuneration"
"Too bad that when you remember # the empowerment act, neither the chancellor nor a single minister is #OttoWels"
"@ mapro67 Agree on wages. But even average earners get problems, so things are necessary"
"@peteraltmaier Exactly what @gruenebundestag wrote was in the red-green resolution proposal yesterday, which you and Merkel rejected"
"@peteraltmaier No, your task is not to name problems, but to develop concrete (!) solutions"
"Today black-yellow and red-green talk about electricity prices. We have a concept, Ramsauer and Altmaier are now arguing publicly with Schwarzgelb"
"@peteraltmaier But now it&#39;s good, Peter! Red-green ministers of the environment have described your numbers as &quot;pulled by the hair&quot;"
@Hansibergle Thank you
@ shad0whunter I would have voted against it last night. But was not in the plenary because I led VA with Egon Bahr
With Egon Bahr on Ostpolitik and his time in Bonn. The great hall filled to the last seat pic.twitter.com/6oszJhk14i
@m_willenbacher They don&#39;t get the other either
@m_willenbacher Agreement at least that no intervention in existing
@SozialoderEgo That has been refuted so many times ...
"@JottEs Sure, but that&#39;s not God given. You can also pass the EEG electricity on to the electricity distributors"
Don&#39;t want anything #Bremsmaier and Merkel decide tonight on energy prices. They have already given this to the countries in writing (!)!
"CDU-MdB Schindler does not answer my question: Why does the black and yellow EEG surcharge increase 300%, while remuneration only increases by approx. 80%"
"Under black and yellow, the price of electricity has risen by 6 cents, @BaerbelHoehn is right. #Bremsmaier wants max. 0.5 cents &quot;brake&quot;"
"Merkel&#39;s next big campaign trick is the &quot;mother&#39;s pension&quot;. Supposedly wanted, but she rejects the SPD offer for a decision now (!)"
@ tweetanno20xx We are sitting at the table and would decide today. But black and yellow doesn&#39;t even have a joint proposal
It is so brazen: Schwarzgelb verifiably (!) Does not submit a proposal for electricity prices and then blames the opposition
@ TheBug0815 As a pirate you know that you can end all content conflicts with a good conversation :-)
@tagesschau contradiction: red-green have a common proposal. Black and yellow argues. Chancellor suggests that nothing be decided today

Asked yesterday in my timeline “@HiBTag: SPD parliamentary group calls for measures against&quot; aggressive tax planning &quot;http://bit.ly/Y5bkxj”
@sonnewindwaerme Of course it is up to date when I point out @peteraltmaier to structural problems where he doesn&#39;t do anything because he&#39;s not suitable for PR
"@peteraltmaier You put no incentive / pressure to regulate fossils. Economically super expensive. Instead, you want to stop renewables"
@peteraltmaier Because fossil power plants continue to operate despite a high renewable energy supply. Make electricity suppliers responsible for renewable energy marketing!
@peteraltmaier But you should read a few facts from time to time :-)
@HeHoffmann No hassle. It&#39;s cool that @baerbelhoehn &amp; Grüne manage to give important topics attention by means of a study.
"@BaerbelHoehn That the media is always flying towards your studies, which contains what has been discussed for a long time? Well done!"

"@kzapgudden I want to talk you out of your excessive pessimism. Not everything is going badly, not all are incompetent"
. @ peteraltmaier That the FDP and CSU publicly contradict you and you remain so vague (despite hundreds of employees) is failure in office
"Oh, @peteraltmaier ... It is normal that opposition without ministries in the back is still divided on one point [1/2]"
". @ peteraltmaier, FDP and CSU disagree. You leave out important topics such as pricing. Just a show or an interest in success?"
"@ pgk1966 That&#39;s right, but you still have to be able to defend yourself against attacks, right? And expect government-approved bills?"
. @ aotto1968_2 Just message: CSU rejects parts of @peteraltmaier&#39;s suggestions. What does the government want to negotiate with us?
@ aotto1968_2 I will not let you out. You have cleared out a prejudice and are owed proof. Embarrassing! http://yfrog.com/kkk15uiwj
Why so self-critical? “@ Aotto1968_2: don&#39;t waste your time with me.”
@ aotto1968_2 Just stick to the topic. Her prejudice: the Federal Council prevented a reduction in remuneration. I have made evidence to the contrary
@ aotto1968_2 Did you know that I had written to Röttgen at the end of 2011 to reduce the PV compensation? He didn&#39;t even answer
"@ aotto1968_2 Wrong: The remuneration was reduced as in the Bundestag resolution. Bureaucracy, for example, less, no 3rd (!) Counter in the basement"
"@ aotto1968_2 With &quot;opinions&quot; I have no problem, with your prejudices"
"@ aotto1968_2 Wrongly researched. Röttgen&#39;s law was stopped. Regulations and deadlines, however, in the compromise supplemented by something else"
@ aotto1968_2 You are a Twitter stalker who always avoids questions. At some point you then draw the conclusion
"@ aotto1968_2 If you again only make allegations without providing facts, discussion is fruitless and I switch to ignore again"
@ aotto1968_2 Answer a question: Where did the Federal Council ever block a price-reducing effect? An example?
@ aotto1968_2 We don&#39;t play bird feed or die. Altmaier doesn&#39;t even have legal text
"@andreasloeschel 2009-2013: EEG electricity volume + 70%, EEG remuneration + 100% (PV effect), collected EEG surcharge&gt; + 300%. Ergo: mismanagement"

Do these viewers have no idea? @katjadoerner in last place? My redial is running!

"@HeHoffmann @ mapro67 I think you are confusing me. Hermann and I boxed this policy together, including exceptions"
"@HeHoffmann It&#39;s not about subsidies for electricity-intensive industry itself, but only for trade-intensive ones"
@ mapro67 2. Do not displace energy-intensive industry to the USA / Gulf states
@ mapro67 1. Pay attention to the (!) energy required for everyone

"Immediately an interview with WDR on horse meat, then a debate on pension policy at IG BAU, then on the joint welfare association"
@JochenFlasbarth Because wealth check bureaucracy. My suggestion was &quot;low consumer tariff&quot; that fits
"@ndroste At the HANDELSBLATT conference you should have heard the voices from business on black yellow, the market and reliability"
Rösler / Altmaier paper has one message above all: unreliability. In D you shouldn&#39;t invest in the energy sector! Devastating
@JochenFlasbarth @andreasloeschel First condition is enough
@andreasloeschel There are models that ensure that electricity tax cuts are well received by citizens
@ manu0307 The insolvency for investors (incidentally also citizen wind farms) would lead to savings of € 60 million according to the black and yellow claim
"Schwarzgelb will forego many proposals, and SPD proposals (including lowering electricity taxes, new EEG surcharge model) will have to accept them"
"If one were to implement black-and-yellow proposals 1: 1, many offshore and onshore wind investors would go bankrupt because there would be no remuneration"
"Black and yellow &quot;electricity price brake&quot; paper, however, still very vague, especially when reducing unjustified subsidies industry"
"With this, concrete negotiations are finally possible. Proposed by me @peteraltmaier for the first time in June 2012 (!)"
The unexpectedly good news first: Black (@peteraltmaier) and yellow (Rösler) actually submit joint paper
"In Bonn you go to the &quot;cultural-political Ash Wednesday&quot;, where it&#39;s not about the shrillest sayings"
Today I had to comfort many disappointed Bonn and Duisburg wrestling fans. Historyless decision of the IOC
So @peteraltmaier wants to know from the others &quot;whether they join in&quot;? But refuses to turn his prose into a concrete draft
@Gerdbillen It is difficult for the opposition to negotiate with a government that cannot agree among themselves
"@Elektronews Unfortunately not in one paper, but in different statements, also in my paper from June 2012"
@BerndSchreiner I know that the Bund-Länder conference was only called up today. I suffer from external determination :-(

@Der_Dutschi Then you seem 101% fixed and hide the grayscale. Pity!
@Der_Dutschi But can you already see the difference between the grand coalition and black and yellow today? Is this a secondary topic?
@Der_Dutschi We just differ. 100% or not at all is not a very responsible attitude.
@Der_Dutschi LINKE even weakened the topic at the time because they covered up the fact that state elections were important for minimum wages
@Der_Dutschi coalition breach for an application that never becomes law because no majority in the Federal Council? What kind of a sign is that?
"@Der_Dutschi The article is nonsense. First, we were in a coalition and were not allowed to agree. Secondly, the majority of the Federal Council was missing"
"@ manu0307 At least I think it is so, then to speak openly about my misjudgment"
@Pereos Crucial difference: He speaks openly about the misjudgments!
"CDU campaigns for minimum wages, which it prevented and FDP against childcare allowance, which it agreed to. It could hardly be more embarrassing!"

"Also in links cited by @Alex_Neubacher, @jochenflasbarth only calls for a ban on permanently installing batteries, not a ban on devices. Wrong track?"
WELT reports on the refusal of the black and yellow federal government in the fight against online warning rip-off http://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/finanzen/article112367393/Schutz-vor-Abzocke-mit-Gewinnspielvertraegen.html…
What does @peteraltmaier say about SPIEGEL&#39;s result that the expansion of the EEG surcharge is so drastic? Until when change?
@andreasloeschel government has claimed: no widening exemptions. Fact check: at least doubling now
It starts again: Order festival of the Bonn Carnival Festival Committee. PS: We also celebrate with Berliners and Swabians :-) pic.twitter.com/WVNCJGiy
Finally SPIEGEL comes to its task in the area of energy policy once http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fakten-check-zum-energiewende-papier-von-wirtschaftsminister-roesler-a-875355.html…
How the Federal Ministry of Transport denies noise protection to citizens.
@hakantee vzbv or media reports
@ victor5679 SLS made a design. Has been blocked by the CDU / CSU for a year
Schwarzgelb does not agree on a bill against warning letters. CDU / CSU blocked to force FDP to make other concessions
"A family can have a warning letter costing 2,000 euros from a child&#39;s super-small mistake CONT"
The economic damage caused by the warning rip-off amounts to (!) Up to one million euros CONT daily
4.3 million Germans have already been victims of warning rip-offs. Online copyright violations and (alleged) downloads CONT
"@schneyra True, funny mistake. So: A small truck load of things mucked out and disposed of :-)"
"So, a small truck mucked out at home and brought to disposal. A good deed every year :-)"
@tsghessen Which film? Hobbit? Ralf is enough?
I visited the Grube-Messel exhibition in Museum Koenig with my children. An unconditional recommendation
Particularly funny about the premature SPIEGEL obituary for Bush: You are already writing about the obituaries of the other media :-) http://www.turi2.de/2012/12/31/heute2-spiegel-online-bringt-bush-nachruf- early-15370733 /…
I wish you both extremists all the best for 2013 :-)

@ manu0307 and what&#39;s the difference in impact?
@LukasStede How would you have argued today if Rösler had been for the ban? So young and already a party soldier :-P
"@TobiasAustrup No! Removing all (!) Exceptions would lead to immediate closings of locations, production would then only be relocated"
Difference between January and March in Berlin? The snow sky is brighter :-)
@TobiasAustrup deal. We want to withdraw the exceptions that have been added in recent years
@MrxFFM Our plea: everything beyond child benefit / allowance in infrastructure and educational offers
@MrxFFM The BVerfG has made the child allowance binding. Child benefit ensures that poorer families are not financially disadvantaged
@MrxFFM No. Otherwise only the high earners benefit from the child allowances
"@phil_grau Unregistered individual demonstrator, there are no counter demonstrations"
Can I get that as a poster? pic.twitter.com/KWotgBRIjN #altmaierbremsen
@ pgk1966 Indeed. Climate change has probably shifted typical weather conditions so that unusual north winds prevail. No contradiction
@MrxFFM Child benefit is the only way to offset the allowances for poorer families set by the Constitutional Court
I'm dreaming of white easter :-)
The nice thing about the winter weather is that the protester who is rushing against immigration has to freeze in the snow flurry :-)
