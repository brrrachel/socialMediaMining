Check facts. There is no such thing as unlimited immigration. http://www.bamf.de/DE/Migration/migration-node.html… welcome culture remains right!
of course not at any price. There will be no social clear cutting and war operations with us!
"No. What was not told when it came to introducing the minimum wage. In the end, it worked as a stimulus package."
Our promises are redeemable and above all affordable. We&#39;ll prove it if you elect us to the government :)
"By immediately raising the minimum wage to € 10, then to € 12 and getting temporary workers 10% more than the permanent employees."
