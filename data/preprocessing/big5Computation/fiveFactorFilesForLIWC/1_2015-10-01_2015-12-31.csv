@SBogi I do not understand: D is convinced that it receives more victims of persecution and civil war refugees than any other country in the EU. 1.2
@SBogi ??? Dark is meaning. But at least you have good manners.
@KleineMaulwurf @AndreasGlas See: I say so !! :-)
@KleineMaulwurf @AndreasGlas Simply go to Altmaier and then go to News. Second or third article from above.

@ sefi99 I am happy &amp; relieved because the coalition has demonstrated its ability to agree and act.
This will relieve the local authorities and create more capacity for people in need.
"That was a good day today: If you are not persecuted and come from a safe country, you will have to leave our country sooner."
@FlorianGathmann @DLF I see 100% exactly the same !!!
"@CaseyHoerth Germany still massivly exporting energy, transition on track, succesful integration of immigrants will strenghten the country"

"EU-Turkey summit: an important step in the right direction. By improving the lot of refugees, we can reduce their number."

@flueke There was a confidante for the NSA selectors that the parliament had proposed ...
Paris is the longing for freedom. You can bomb it - you just can&#39;t destroy it!
@GoeringEckardt @neomagazin At most a few green kiwi!
@SBogi 2/2 But whoever lives safely and freely in his country is not entitled to asylum. It&#39;s the same everywhere.
@GoeringEckardt @neomagazin I would also use crumble and whipped cream without plums! :-)
@FlorianMoertl @neomagazin I did! Short but to the point: compliments!
@FlorianMoertl @neomagazin Okay: strawberry cake and Black Forest cherry! :-)

@gregorspilato At least! :-)
@DNW_GMH You really missed something!
@ patricknnm47 huh? Do you think a &quot;team&quot; would come up with &quot;strawberry cake&quot;? What you read is what I wrote! :-)
@ BelaAnda1 We are in contact with France and we will do what we have to do as soon as there is the slightest sign.
"We cry for the innocent dead of Paris. But we will never bow to hatred, fanaticism and violence!"
It is so sad that France has been attacked for the second consecutive time: Paris is the birthplace of our universal values!
Tonight we are all French!

"Dear @fneuhann, YOUR part in @berlindirekt was exciting + good: Thank you! And since today I know who Sister Theodula was! :-)"
The attack on Henriette Reker does the opposite of what we wanted: our shared values are stronger than xenophobic violence!
@KohlmeierSPD @larsklingbeil Okay. Then let us go to bed at this venue! :-)
@larsklingbeil That anyway. But old friendship doesn&#39;t rust ...
@tirsales @larsklingbeil @HeikoMaas We have followed the guidelines of the BVerfG very closely. We&#39;ll see!
@flueke @larsklingbeil @HeikoMaas Then we first ask Otto Schily what he thinks of it. :-)
@larsklingbeil Why should someone do something like that? It was a draft law by @HeikoMaas

@RainerLoveiam Irgenwann I had to block you: and bye!
@fun_cello :-)
@dominikrzepka i guess you will send it ?! :-)
@dominikrzepka @ARD_BaB What did he say?
@ FranzB49 It would be even better if he has not started on his way because he knows that he cannot stay.
