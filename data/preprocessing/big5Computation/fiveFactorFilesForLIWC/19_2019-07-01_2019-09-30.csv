"A hospital does not have to pay off in the first place, but must be responsible for the health of its citizens. The same applies to water, energy, education and housing. These things must be cooperative or non-profit, or the state must have direct influence. https://t.co/ZtCq5wUmG1"
Real and perceived disadvantage is also perceived in the generation for whom the wall and divided country almost sound like the Middle Ages. This only disappears when there are no concrete experiences of disadvantage. @superillu https://t.co/tgIMTc3Wa5

"With Sigmund Jähn, a real hero of our time has died who was very reserved and humble. As the first German in space, he stays in our history books. My sincere condolences to his family. https://t.co/s6bT6EWCxX"
"A tragedy: The auto companies have preferred to develop fraud software rather than engines that meet the limit values in reality. Capitalism, the market itself, is not able to develop an environmentally friendly, resource-saving economy. @berlinerzeitung https://t.co/McblhcsNYg"
"70 years ago today Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. He was 73 at the time - two days younger than Wilhelm Pieck, who became the first president of the GDR in 1949. Hm, everyone should make their own thoughts."
"What moment is the beauty of life? That you are needed by people and can actually help. The feeling that you are needed but cannot help is terrible. The feeling that you are not needed at all, too. @SSuperhelden https://t.co/vLZgeuH3Ab https://t.co/z7avEpLJp5"

"We are experiencing a kind of Trumpization against the established. This is also due to the fact that the state in rural areas withdrew from its responsibility for a socially secure, economically promising &amp; culturally worth living. https://t.co/rRlgCrcaqc"
"We have to define our new identity, i.e. how we bring ecology and social issues together, and face our changed role as an established force. Now we all have to focus on success in the elections in Thuringia. @zeitonline https://t.co/AF8fTAJdgm"
Housing is a question of public services. Does a hospital have to pay off in the first place or be responsible for health? Politicians have to ensure that every citizen in Germany can realize the right to affordable housing. @maischberger #Mietendeckel https://t.co/YU3xBAsfaz
The AfD wants to build walls. The wall broke down. She doesn&#39;t want freedom of expression. Quite the opposite of what people fought &amp; fought for in 1989. By the way: The liberation of the East happened in the East - not through Helmut Kohl. @maischberger https://t.co/IRWxgpihLf

"@Nato&#39;s 2% armaments target: we spent 38.5 billion in 2018, 43.2 billion are planned for 2019, then should it be over € 75 billion? I have rarely seen such misdirected tax revenue. There is no neighboring country that is preparing to wage war against us."

Trump&#39;s termination of the #Iranian nuclear deal is a fatal license to only have to stick to international agreements if you like it. The world has reached a point where the entire post-war order is in question https://t.co/rqyMp9t4NZ https://t.co/J33UHlzNvt
