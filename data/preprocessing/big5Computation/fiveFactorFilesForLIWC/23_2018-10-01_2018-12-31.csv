"The &quot;inner rage&quot; !? You can also get overwhelmed by tweeting. But there should still be room for improvement, unfortunately! Good news!"
I think it&#39;s not just a reporter. The question of the tasks and rules of journalism / media as 4th violence is of concern to many people all year round. And storytelling instead of reporting often happens! There is a need for discussion!
There are several police unions. Where are the others?
It should only sound in the ears what is actually in the tweet!
What is the level of criticism equal to the AfD level?
"One will be allowed to ask what for ...!? I am not questioning the √ñR, but referring to the fact that I am paying and that they currently want more. So you have to ask! That started - rightly - with the discussion about talk shows and goes up to the salary of the directors."

"1. End the # male quota (did he say something about that? Oh no, that doesn&#39;t fit into his ‚Äúattention-grabbing‚Äù model, which he has been driving successfully since the end of his judging period). 2. What does he think of the compliance rules of the #BVerfG? ü§ó"
