I&#39;m thinking of victims and relatives of the attack in New York. We stand against hatred and violence!
We want the United States of Europe. Nous voulons les États-Unis d&#39;Europe. We want the United States of Europe.
"A convention should write this constitutional treaty, which includes civil society and people. The result must be presented in all member states and those who disagree automatically leave the EU."
"Mr. Dobrindt called me &quot;European radicals&quot;. I have only one answer: yes, I am radically pro-European. #europaradikal"
2017 must be a fresh start for the SPD. I am now in Frankfurt to work on it together with our members.
Many thanks to my party for this party congress! Now it is up to each and every one of us: let&#39;s renew our SPD and make policies that improve people&#39;s lives a little bit every day. Have a safe trip home!
I am happy that my friend Emmanuel Macron will receive the Charlemagne Prize. This is an important and encouraging signal at a time when European unification is being questioned internally and externally.
I wish you and your loved ones a happy new year and a great 2018! With all my heart I thank everyone who supported me this year.
"I want a European constitutional treaty that creates a federal Europe. A Europe that is not a threat to its member states, but a meaningful addition."
"We mourn Greta Wehner. With her we lose a lifelong social democrat, a convinced and convincing democrat and a pioneer for political education."

"President Macron and the Commission presented their reform ideas for the EU. The European debate on the future is in full swing. Germany must no longer stand on the sidelines, but must courageously seize the opportunities that are now available to us."
Mário Centeno has just been elected as the new President of the Eurogroup. Parabéns!
"A new government has to tackle the major political challenges. If the SPD party congress agrees, the SPD will talk to the other parties about it. The basis must be our basic social democratic beliefs and the election program. There are no automatisms."
Federal Minister Schmidt&#39;s scandalous behavior and massive loss of trust within the federal government and between the parties. The SPD is still on course: we will campaign for a nationwide ban on glyphosate.
"I am shocked by the news of the attack on the mayor Andreas Hollstein. Democrats must stand together against hatred and violence, because they must have no place in our society. I wish him a speedy recovery in the family."
"Congratulations, dear Navid Kermani, on your 50th birthday! In these times, Germany needs your keen eye, your advice and your linguistic strength more than ever."
We may get a constellation that has never existed in the history of the Federal Republic. We don&#39;t need to be afraid of that. And that&#39;s why we need calm and serenity now. I have both.
"At the invitation of the Federal President, I will take part in a discussion with him and the chairmen of the CDU and CSU on Thursday. In the upcoming talks, we rely on the strength of our arguments, not on Kraftmeierei in the media. I also advise the CDU and CSU."
"Social Democracy will be running a great top candidate in Hesse for the state election in 2018: Congratulations, dear Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, on your election today! The whole party and I will support you wherever we can."

The increasing number of victims of the attack in Egypt horrifies us all. My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives.
"The Federal President called on the parties for talks in a dramatic appeal. We will not refuse that. If this leads us to participate in any form of government in any form, the SPD members will vote on it."
Make big profits and close locations at the same time: what Siemens is doing is not social - it is irresponsible. We stand by the employees! pic.twitter.com/bzaIdVL00D
"Stephan Weil has just been re-elected Prime Minister of Lower Saxony. I am very happy for you, Stephan. And I&#39;m happy for Lower Saxony. Congratulations and good luck!"
We are not available to join a grand coalition - this constellation has been voted out. We are not afraid of new elections.
I wish you all a nice holiday on today&#39;s 500th #Reformation day. I&#39;m going to read a good book today.
Eight dialogue forums in all corners of the country. Hundreds of cardboards full of ideas. Our renewal process did not end today in Nuremberg. He&#39;s just started. pic.twitter.com/geztiAQIJs
"We need passionate and critical internal debates and unity outside. Our dialogue forum with 1,000 committed comrades in Castrop-Rauxel was exemplary in every sense. Thanks for your contributions! pic.twitter.com/3ASzuyHmIm"
On the #day of the lecture my tip for all parents: “Stories from Franz” by Christine Nöstlinger. I always enjoyed reading aloud. :) pic.twitter.com/k7Xmnccn55
"Germany cannot wait, Europe cannot wait. I appeal to everyone involved in the Schwampel soundings: let the show, negotiate seriously and come to Potte."
"So far, Europe has not played a role in the probes. Ms Merkel will also not take part in the EU social summit. She waves from the balcony in Berlin - other governments are starting to make Europe more social. Germany threatens to fail as the EU&#39;s motor for reform."
"Technological progress must always lead to social progress. To do this, we need to work hand in hand with the unions. Was just with DGB boss Reiner Hoffmann at the EVG congress. pic.twitter.com/ZR1g9U1W2g"
"Controversial debates honor a party and our democracy. If, as a party in Berlin, we openly discuss and then fight for it, we can do anything. pic.twitter.com/bbHghzhXVC"
"&quot;Because I also want to live freely and safely at 80,&quot; answered an 18-year-old in Wolfsburg today. I asked him why he came to the SPD. His answer touched me. We should make a claim to you. pic.twitter.com/mBqhQU51aD"
The perpetrators of the 1938 pogrom night are no longer dangerous to us today. But their ideology that some people are worth more than others is. We oppose that. No more anti-Semitism again! Never again fascism!
I was like many other eyewitnesses to how peaceful protest over the lack of freedom prevailed 28 years ago. Courageous people brought down the Berlin Wall with their efforts. I still have deep respect for the enormous life achievement of the East Germans.
Thank you for the good discussion today at @SPDFraktionRLP! Addressing everyday problems of people with optimism - (also) you can learn from Malu Dreyer and @Alex_Schweitzer. pic.twitter.com/slE1uBT2kP
A car crashed into our party headquarters last night. In it substances were found with which one can start a fire. We don&#39;t know the details yet. But I am extremely happy that no colleagues have been harmed. Thanks also to all emergency services!
I wish you on Christmas Eve and the coming days a peaceful time full of relaxation and nice encounters. I would like to express my sincere thanks to all who will work during this time. You keep the store going.
The CSU does not want to probe before the exam in Seeon (formerly: Kreuth). So we need a little more time. I proposed to the SPD party executive that the special party conference on January 21. to do in Bonn.
"I will keep our fingers crossed for our sister party and its chairman in the election in Catalonia on December 21st. They stand for balance and cohesion in Spain and Europe: Querido @miqueliceta, mucho éxito para las elecciones! You podréis contar con la amistad del SPD!"
"Five years ago, Peter Struck, a great social democrat, a staunch parliamentarian and above all a great person, died. I was able to work closely with him at the time when we were both political group leaders. I will never forget him."
Today I commemorate the dead of the vicious attack on Breitscheidplatz a year ago. And I think of their relatives. We have to do more for the victims and their bereaved.
No matter what some demand or others speculate: It is clear to me that the exploratory talks will be conducted with no results. So the party congress &amp; party board decided. And that&#39;s how we do it.
"Good, long overdue news: Mesale Tolu is released! #FreeDeniz and everyone else!"
"We will now probe. It remains to be seen whether the talks will lead to the formation of a government. Our party congress then decides on how to proceed, and we involve our members intensively. We do without balcony pictures and tweeted intermediate stands. It&#39;s about a lot."
I wish all Jews here and worldwide a blessed Hanukkah festival! My best wishes to the Jewish community here and around the world for a happy Hanukkah!
"I am happy that Erwin Sellering has survived his severe cancer therapy. With his return to state politics, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania regains an accomplished politician. I have the highest respect for this sense of responsibility."
The anti-Semitic failures of the past few days are disgusting in every respect. We cannot and will not tolerate such a thing in Germany!
300 days in custody are 300 too many. My solidarity is with Deniz Yücel. #FreeDeniz
I am delighted that my friend Emmanuel Macron is receiving the Charlemagne Prize. It is an important and encouraging signal in time for attacks against the EU from inside and outside.
"With Lars Klingbeil we have the right general secretary at the right time. I congratulate you on your choice, dear Lars! Let&#39;s renew this party together. pic.twitter.com/PvLQihuKrX"
"Thank you for your trust, thank you for my reelection as party leader. Let us now renew the SPD together, make Germany fairer and found a new Europe! pic.twitter.com/3EX2e7EpoE"
A convention shall draft this treaty in close cooperation with the civil society and the people. Its results will then be submitted to all member states. Any state that won’t ratify this treaty will automatically leave the EU.
"I want a new constitutional treaty to establish the United States of Europe. A Europe that is no threat to its member states, but a beneficial addition."
"Hans Schäfer was a hero for me, for FC, for our whole country. A great guy, down to earth. He will be missing. Thank you, dear Hans."
Great journal. Work on Paradise Papers. Lacquered people are honest taxpayers. Need European Solution against these machinations!
I am deeply affected by the cruel shooting in the USA. Trump must finally give up his nonsensical blockade on gun laws.
Need online topic platforms with the right to apply to federal party conferences for more participation and compatibility of family and party work.
"Our renewal will be comprehensive - in terms of content, organization and structure. I am now discussing the way there in Kaiserslautern."
There is so much in the SPD. I could feel that today. I look to the future with confidence. We have to make better use of this potential.
Thank you for the serious &amp; lively debate at #SPDerneuern in HH. We will continue to work with your ideas for a strong SPD.
Discuss the future of our party in HH with 600 members. I am overwhelmed by the great interest &amp; great suggestions.
The best news for a long time: Peter Steudtner is free. Great joy. But we don&#39;t forget all the others.
That was a good #UBVK. Together we tackle the new beginning. We rely on dialogue and listening. Be there: http://www.spd.de/spderneuern/
"This is a great victory for the Lower Saxony SPD. Dear Stephan, what you have done in the past few weeks is without a role model!"
Stephan is fighting. The SPD is fighting. I fight. We fight. Fight with. It is worth fighting. It&#39;s about a good future for Lower Saxony.
Solidarity with Mesale Tolu and the other arbitrarily detained in Turkey! Who locks journalists away abolishes the rule of law!
On World Girls Day I wish all girls the same opportunities and rights so that they can become what they want as women.
Lucky day for an ex-bookseller with affinity for Europe: Robert Menasse receives book award for EU novel &quot;The Capital&quot;. Read!
Michael Vassiliadis remains chair of my IG BCE. Congratulations on your re-election - and until Friday in Hanover.
Willy Brandt died 25 years ago today. To commemorate him also means keeping an eye on the future of the SPD.
The life achievement of the East Germans deserves respect. And respect also means reliable pensions and fair wages.
The escalation in Spain is worrying. Madrid and Barcelona must de-escalate immediately and seek dialogue.
"From today, everyone who loves each other can finally get married in Germany. And that&#39;s just as well. Thanks to everyone who fought with us."
