Your newspaper is the most popular among the major media among AfD supporters. What about your responsibility now? Or did you just want to mob?
&quot;Well informed&quot; is exhausting. It is easier to reproduce platitudes.
I keep experiencing that journalists find it extremely difficult.
"Ultimately, how often do you write an article that is the opposite of your initial thesis?"

"Unfortunately, the #media concentrate almost exclusively on what Merkel is doing. Why not report what 1000 CDU officials and members also say every day and that is NOT scandalizable, but politically necessary: why? Because 1000e are irrelevant if the tip spins."

Do you think that is wrong? Do you think it is extremist? H√∂cke is a flawless extremist and Gauland prepares his field.
Gauland together with H√∂cke would be worse than Merkel. Anyone who thinks this is medicine will pay a high price.
