@Alex_Mitrakas :-)
"@RmuzF Sorry, #fail. Tomorrow again. :-)"
@flueke
. @ Regierungs4tel
@borismueller :-)
The appointments are getting better around midweek: I look forward to talking to @herrurbach!
@realmbruehl but I had spoken of &quot;opposing candidate&quot; :-)
The result of the FDP membership decision is good news for Europe and great encouragement for the coalition! :-)
"@android_berlin excellent analysis! As long as you keep this arc of tension, life remains bearable!"
"@moritz_schlarb True: Saarland is not part of Europe, Saarland is Europe!"
"If everyone who was nice to me on Twitter were a fake account, the whole network would be contaminated! @red_hardliner @HoffmannPhilip #oderso"
@HendrikSachtler Thanks for the flowers! You can&#39;t get old with such timpani beats! :-))
@edomblog I&#39;m not a quick memory! :-))
@ world famous thanks! We keep the EU flag high!
@simbauer Congratulations: the network forgets nothing! Best regards
You have to know the past to be able to correctly assess the present! @ uncut02
@simonliebing I said yes that he has to answer the questions. :-)
"@muehlenwind From my point of view it would not be, but presumably it works along the lines of comparable facilities"
@netzpolitik I think any pressure in this direction is wrong. #Staatsollsichraushalten
@JoernPL I am especially against the fact that we providers make any regulations or printing
@christiansoeder :-))
I can not see that something has been &quot;pulled through&quot; so far! @mathiasrichel @kritikkultur @JoernPL
@christiansoeder Why should we vacate meaningful positions? SPD even stays with #VDS
The group has no other suggestions. @mathiasrichel
It remains: coalition u CDU are against legal network closures! @mathiasrichel
"@richardcwilliam @johnhumphrys We shouldt not feed the anger of the tabloids. As Politicians, we should rather unite than divide."
"@joaum If so, I wish you a good party with a happy new year! :-))"
"@Linuzifer @herrurbach @laprintemps Oh, there were many more who ate cookies. This is called &quot;dialogue&quot; and is good for everyone. :-)"
"@pedromiramis @constanzekurz Then she didn&#39;t understand what &quot;learning&quot; means. Incidentally, I am criticized for the fact that my tweets are getting fewer."
"Dear @SteinbachErika, I wish you that too! I will fight on all fronts until tomorrow evening, then it will be contemplative !!"
On the way to the Saar: First in the state parliament or would you prefer to go to the Tonhalle? I&#39;m very happy!
@herrurbach The good impression is mutual. Thanks back + Thanks for the letter: The discussion has only just begun!
"@aprica I don&#39;t need a survey for this, I can feel that in hundreds of conversations. But it always depends on what is asked for."
"@aprica That&#39;s right, but SPD has always been close to CDU on internal security. And #VDS was Brigitte Zypries&#39; law!"
@karpfenpeter SPD-Paper has shown that CDU is not alone in #VDS. Both still have more than 60%. This affects doubters in the CDU
@Ranjit_Bains1 @BBCr4today I was reassuring because I really mean it: There are barely people more european-minded than my british friends!
@ JoeJoe_7319 @kungler So I personally like to ride a bike! Sometimes I go sledding with someone. :-)
@NavyBK @herrurbach Now I will get to know him (and he me): The question is then: Who knows whom?
@ pant3r Don&#39;t really know: With the KT we will definitely experience something!
@flueke Gefhr was great that it would be general cookies. Then I remember: We also wanted to drink coffee: 030-227-73542
"@docanonymous_ Yes, the problem is the appointment. I&#39;m here, but privately: unfortunately only a few days until Easter without politics. Happy next time!"
@SchnuffelPirat @herrurbach He wanted it that way !!! You should have warned him! At the end he applies for the #VDS
@SteinbachErika @tj_tweets That is also my impression when I look in the mirror in the morning. Especially after Christmas parties! :-))
@herrurbach Yes why not? I have had completely different appointments. :-) Please mt my office030-227-73542
"@korbinian @feuertinte @dorobaer The BVerfg declares that it is possible, albeit within narrow limits!"
"@SchaengelPirat To be honest, I don&#39;t think the number of months is decisive. I think there is more!"
@Duesenberg_ @ pyth2_0 I think about it and find it a shame that nobody is involved in the network.
@SlickRights :-))
@bohemianberlin This is due to my condition after the Christmas party! sorry :-))
@herrurbach is that easy? Pirates have 7% and not 70%. And even all of your Twitter friends together are not the majority.
@ TheBug0815 @herrurbach Exactly that was not meant. The further network development is wonderful and I want to protect it!
"@cdubasis you too! I am very network-savvy, but I also have a heart for internal security. :-))"
@ pyth2_0 I also pleaded not for #VDS but for a compromise!
"@ fire ink I think the @dorobaer is sagar against #VDS. For me, it differs: u laws have to be implemented."
"@HendrikSachtler That was the nicest tweet since I&#39;ve been on Twitter. No free ticket, but great human!"
@SlickRights You know me badly: idealism is the most beautiful thing in life!
@aprica @herrurbach Can do all surveys. The result depends on the question. The SPD&#39;s decision changed a lot.
@phil_grau @ pyth2_0 Depends on the audience. It is suicide for network-savvy people. Not with others.
"@zonkinoff You don&#39;t have to read my tweets. By the way, believe that I am quite differentiated!"
@Volker_Beck @herrurbach Volker &#39;Beck always wants to make prey. The Greens always gave the Schily everything!
"@ maltespitz I never denied that. But nobody prevents us from thinking, #Adenauer looking forward to coffee and cake."
"@digitales_Ich @jakobmierscheid doesn&#39;t hurt anyone! He is a nice guy, but totally from yesterday!"
@ TheBug0815 @seitics The pirates are not a coalition partner so quickly. But an extremely important innovation in the political system!
@irm_tw @herrurbach #VDS was not meant. Whoever turns the word in my mouth is to blame! :-)
"@KonstantinNotz You&#39;re confusing something: the Greens are tweeting in the survey recession, but Germany is still doing well! :-)"
Let&#39;s see. Now get me off the field. Always a pleasure. Greetings to @ Kyra2001 and all angels of the world!
"@ Kyra2001 We are still in the middle of work in the BT and as a PGF it is going well, but next Where would be much better and I would be in a better mood! :-)"
"@ Kyra2001 But talk a lot about #DE because I have now understood what it is good for. Don&#39;t do it anyway, but I&#39;m coming soon!"
"@ Kyra2001 Oh yes, but I still don&#39;t have a damn headset and the Mumble software is not installed either. 1.2"
@nowrap @huxi 100% agree!
"@NavyBK I agree. Would not be the case with #VDS. Nevertheless, we need a compromise that is also acceptable to critics."
"@ TheBug0815 That was not what was meant: It was about freedom on the net that can be misused by multinationals, for example."
@levudev I have often argued against the majority of my party. But the majority decides. The minority protect the laws.
"@ 9er0 @aprica For example, I also feel that everyone on the net is against #VDS + that&#39;s not a bad argument."
"@huxi Definitely! Nevertheless, the majority in democracy decides: Even if it is still wrong!"
@herrurbach @ thebug0815 Freedom has to be as long as it doesn&#39;t threaten anyone. Problems arise when e.g. Multinationals spread themselves online
"@cdubasis Yes, none of this is one-dimensional. Authorities are also not perfect. #Beruhigend"
"@flueke CDU does not want the authorities to fall behind. However, many politicians have not yet understood the network dimension."
"@presroi @flueke Our worldview is based on freedom and responsibility. This allows #VDS, but also shows limits."
".@drbenjohnson @BBCr4today I would rather say ""realistic"": British people are pragmatic and very openminded. Thats what Europe needs."
@ian_bath @BBCr4today The UK ist an net contributor not only in money but also in ideas. Brits are amongst the most able EU-supporters!
"@norberthense But you trust me too much! After all, we live in a democracy! :-)"
@scanlines Why lie: A majority is required for a change. Would not even be possible with D!
"@jolyonwagg1 However, if UK, Danmark, Sweden would have joined it from the beginning, the Euro could be the worlds strongest currency!"
"@Andyhesse @karpfenpeter That is the problem: No matter what the state is doing now, there is mistrust. #Vertrauensbildung"
. @ ronpatz With Twitter you can really get around! I sensed that it could all be used against you. :-))
"@marlenemortler Dear Marlene, We both watched Overath at the time, but for the @tj_tweets it&#39;s the war of 1870/71!"
"@ passerby16 Unfortunately, but these four: German, Dutch, English and French - all with a lot of mistakes and a lack of practice!"
@BastiCologne It is now clear that it was a false alarm. #Entenhausen :-)
@karpfenpeter I agree that we will need a lot more safeguards in the future to prevent misuse.
@s_lucke She should have known that the EU could face convictions and fines. And now?
@oliverdasgupta It&#39;s very simple: there is a risk of fines and convictions by the EU. Pacta sunt servanda! :-)
@BastiCologne I don&#39;t think that is convincing and I don&#39;t think it will come.
@s_lucke I am always nice to @sls_bmj and I really appreciate her. But I&#39;m afraid she put a lot of pressure on herself ...
@tj_tweets Overath was a soccer player before the First World War?
@tj_tweets :-)
@presroi So far only @tj_tweets has been tweeting lonely. Think they&#39;re on Twitter&#39;s strike. I&#39;m also looking forward to analog!
@chrissielefranc why should it be against UK interest to strenghten budgetary disciplin ?
@ JvdK1985 I really like that more and more young people in Germany are very interested in our neighboring country!
@Fabian_ikono :-))
@pulegon @Fischblog @reinboth Hopefully your own blog will be a Christmas present! I already have a lot of topics :-)
@Fabian_ikono @herrurbach :-))
"@herrurbach Good question. If you use a @ account, it is a public SMS! :-)"
"@RavenoDeFaune I have no problem with you. But @pirat_logos has only tweeted to me so far, no followers and no one follows. Strange."
@RavenoDeFaune That should make it clear that from @Pirat_Logos I still don&#39;t know who he is and what he wants.
@ thomask77 You hit the crucial point: we need a total solution that takes into account the rapid development. No piecemeal.
The key question is what the state is allowed to do with regard to enormous network and storage development and what is not!
Thanks for huge echo on #VDS. Show me the importance of finding consensus. Lazy compromise would not be a consensus. 1.2
@ Government4tel That would be added!
"@Pirat_Logos Funny: You still have no followers, they follow no one and get all your tweets looking for me!"
@ mh120480 you too! Yesterday I pleaded for historical compromise!
@simonstuetzer Why should I criticize good people? But honestly: We currently have even more important problems!
@petertauber Don&#39;t believe him a word. Probably beaver ragout (looks very similar to venison and venison ragout!)
@laprintemps :-))
"Oh, only now noticed: My 2000. Tweet was @Laprintemps! But that was also appropriate!"
@KlarerVerstand The strange is above all a stylistic device with which attention can be achieved for something that deserves it!
. @ laprintemps But I see it very differently! Rarely discussed with someone who has such a good eye for the essentials! Was funny!
"@ki_naudiz then I was definitely not in today, GsD :-)"
@Elsevierbrussel That is Europe: A German politician talks on English TV and is followed by a Dutch Journalist! :-)
@reklamezentrale :-)) Read You!
"@ aotto1968_2 Admit it&#39;s difficult, but if it were easy, you wouldn&#39;t have to think about it."
Unfortunately I have to make an appointment now. Check out what I&#39;ve done later! :-))
"@herrurbach We are at the beginning of wonderful things. They must be able to develop, even if we do not yet know the result."
"@buschsalat @herrurbach It&#39;s always like that, but doesn&#39;t change the result. #Democracy"
@Pirat_Elex I think that the general public is rather indifferent. Answer varies depending on the wording question.
"I&#39;m off now. It was nice again, much to EU tomorrow."
@stagerbn We will see that again!
@tknuewer don&#39;t know anyone in Germany who wants total surveillance
@wokrim not necessarily. It works excellently with vehicle register data
"@tknuewer Yes I am public. Today I am in Berlin, Frankfurt, Ensdorf, Overath and Rehlingen! Pirates don&#39;t stream every phone call either!"
@KlarerVerstand I don&#39;t quite understand. We are currently talking about #VDS and whether compromise is possible. Has nothing to do with video!
@ JvdK1985 I have been a great admirer of Dutch culture + politics for 30 years! My Dutch can unfortunately be improved
@Duesenberg_ Unfortunately only 3 (Franz.Engl.Niederl.) And they sit in my head! :-) # Follower service
"The Dutch / German cooperation was particularly intensive, important and successful!"
"Now, the 23 - 25 MS must prove strenght and determination. This could mean a new dynamic of integration!"
The UK's veto is regrettable because it's participation would have been a strong signal of determination to overcome the crisis.
"I'm disappointed that we have to sign a seperate Treaty, but I'm delighted to see 23 - 25 Member States joining it!"
@tknuewer 2/2 today almost every conversation and can be viewed by the police / courts at any time :-)
"@tknuewer At #VDS this is currently not public, as use is only possible in strict exceptional cases. My diary already contains 1/2"
@Joerg_Werner Last night you didn&#39;t know how right you were with your last tweet!
@Joerg_Werner After all: yes they have beautiful gardens! :-)
"@JU_Paderborn First of all, I will be on breakfast TV tomorrow 8:10 am, but only to Al Qaeda. Information about the EU as soon as there is news."
@Pillendreher Thank you!
@Joerg_Werner It&#39;s always a good idea. Have fun in Hungary!
"UK is heavily interested in avoiding world-wide recession. Therefore, it should agree to trearty-change without any other condition"
"@Elsevierbrussel I don&#39;t think so. If GB does not participate, a 17-country agreement is the only possible solution"
@maltespitz OK. Get in touch.
@JRehborn A few understand almost everything from the net and a great many almost nothing!
@JRehborn So we get closer to the thing! That&#39;s exactly what I wanted to say when I spoke about parallel worlds in FAZ. 1.2
"@maltespitz Oh, e.g. on copyright. You also make it too easy for yourself with #VDS. But we should really drink coffee!"
"@SteveRueck @JRehborn Funny: Each of my online noises gives a big hello on Twitter, 3-page mirror conversation offline not at all. :-)"
"@korbinian Not at all, because it is so common here. Incidentally, the first person to successfully use me was @psychoTRON. Smart and good."
@JRehborn ok. :-)
@lassebecker :-))
"@JRehborn Yes, but if an article only appears in print media and not online, for example, the digital natives will not find out! :-)"
@danielmack But hello there is the separation! You don&#39;t notice each other! :-) Sometimes you even exclude yourself!
@TiloJung :-)
@danielmack It was easy for the Greens because they avoided all controversy. Kind of like if CDU would vote pro #VDS.
@TiloJung Hopefully we&#39;ll never sink that low!
"@sekor Herrmann, Beckstein and Söder will burst with pride! :-)"
@danielmack @KonstantinNotz Really only a few ???
"@HendrikSachtler Why not: Everyone can hear that in the original. Of course, as you can see from your photo, you are immune to narcissism!"
@danielmack The @KonstantinNotz should really fiddle with the intolerants of the Greens. Then he would get a lot of followers!
. @ _ rafl You would never have believed Twitter to have someone like @peteraltmaier act like that. :-))
. @ KonstantinNotz is a smart mind. He only says that to agitate his followers. But they actually like @DoroBaer + @peteraltmaier
"@ Advertising center, however, nobody has accused me of being too few politicians in my life ... :-)"
"I kicked something off when I wanted to commend the SPD! Sign me up, but only now live in BBC Newsnight 22.37 to Euro."
@theQ_Ffm I&#39;m not so sure about that. Mathematicians can prove that 2 + 2 are not necessarily 4.
@Tannador :-))
With #VDS we need an approach that reconciles both sides + can be accepted by everyone. Neither side can win with all or nothing.
SPD wrestled with #VDS. That was brave + worthy of recognition. Shows that this topic is not just black and white. (1/2)
@A piece of cheese :-)
@MoonShadeOsu Study the texts with great profit. There was already misunderstanding with the press in the Berlin election program. Maybe so wanted?
"@ Einstueckkaese Happens to me continuously, I&#39;m used to it. It is so in this network! :-) But still sorry and no offense ..."

@kventil The revolution that would eat me would have digestive problems afterwards! Absolutely not recommendable!
@Pirat_Logos How do you know the pirates? You do not follow them and the connection to your website is not trustworthy.
@HerbFlintstone Cute is always good. And I know who was meant by the &quot;fat&quot; baby ... :-))
"@Pirat_Logos See how many pirates I follow! Meet some in a casual sequence, e.g. @beapirate @tirsales or @Schmidtlepp"
"@sofakissen I&#39;m not there for a long time, but I meet a remarkable number of smart people! Must have something to do with the medium!"
@Einstueckkaese But you&#39;ve been there for a while! Wait ... :-)
@JohannesPonader Probably not! Still compliments that you got it done!
@Joerg_Werner They shamelessly exploit the fatherly / motherly feelings of the observers .. But you cannot be seriously angry with them!

@Demon81 :-)

@heliantje :-))
@shred_ Netzfilter come from Scandinavia and #VDS came from the SPD (Zypries). And I always thought: learning from them means learning to win
"How true: A Twitter account does not yet have network expertise, but those who don&#39;t even have one are pretty flat on the net! :-)"
Pirates have long been at the forefront of the network. But the revolution eats their children and the web can do much more than most pirates think!
. @ RavenoDeFaune I&#39;m not so sure about that! Twitter has huge development potential as a reputable medium
"@sschuermann So far, however, the CDU has survived all revolutions (which you can&#39;t really say about the revolutionaries!)"
"@JoergPassmann Oh, felt like 10 years (although Twitter hasn&#39;t been that long)"

"@ andreasmueller1 In the meantime, the agencies are reporting what I have known on Twitter for about 1 hour: Clear majority of votes (almost 60%) for construction."
". @ Farlion This is always the case with such decisions: you don&#39;t have to like them, but you should accept them."
"@borismueller You see each other several times in life, but now everyone should bury the hatchet"
@ulierhard That was not the point today: the clear majority of the votes cast want construction to take place.
@jbenno I only asked for TKÜ sources. Thanks for the honest opinion.
The BaWü&#39;s made a wise decision because the result does not seem short but clear. That should make acceptance easy for everyone.
@jbenno If you see that soi you will certainly accept Quellen-TKÜ
. @ ruedigerp then you would know with whom you last telephoned.
. @ ruedigerp Have not yet committed myself to #VDS since I&#39;ve been on Twitter. Data from the last 3 weeks would help with the murders
What doesn&#39;t happen when you mention #VDS! I will respond to all the different questions at #politcamp on Tuesday with @Volker_Beck
"@aprica Quick freeze goes in the USA because providers are allowed to save all data. With us they have to be deleted, so it doesn&#39;t work."
"@ f4453 I am against violence. However, some protesters are not &quot;squeamish&quot; either. What is &quot;squeamish&quot;? Better avoid the word"
Best pizza greetings to Kiel! Good advice on network policy + courage to set smart priorities instead of simple wishlists # bdk11
"@aprica When Greens say they are against #VDS, this is not new. But they would not have to say how they reconcile the network and security."
"@Ralf_Stegner Well. SPD has missed the advent of the Greens and then the Left, now that of the pirates. Great balance! CDU = bourgeois modernism"
"@themroc You know how it is: if we get started from the CDU, then we will do it right! Can only do network policy well!"
@codeispoetry will still come with the base. Above all said that the B90 avoided many sticking points and therefore made it too easy
@HerbFlintstone voters we have millions + that was an individual opinion that I do not share. Am for European police work and de-escalation
@Media cigar :-))
"@huettemann I thought you were with us tomorrow! Finally, I make my last speech as president! :-)"
@ManfredMarkert There could be a few more among the members. But I don&#39;t know them exactly. Maybe the KT will be tweeting soon
"@sebaso I discussed this with the Internet Study Commission on Wednesday. It won&#39;t be easy, but it is realistic until 2013."
"@ManfredMarkert Absolutely. But that comes faster than you think. By 2013, the proportion will increase tenfold. Then you become an &quot;honorary pioneer&quot;"
1st day of the EUD Congress great thanks to the Polish Ambassador&#39;s tougher speech. Now colorful evening with Ringelpietz.
@ManfredMarkert Have the impression that thanks to @DoroBaer the CSU is well on the way to becoming &quot;the&quot; network party! #LaptopundLederhose
@sebaso I would mainly focus on establishing the importance of network access + integrity through all-party consensus
@ PsychoTR0N you still exist! Had been missing you for a while. Nice 1st Advent :-)
Good luck at the JU NRW Day. Compliments to @SvenVolmering and all Twitter friends for a good presence on the net! Greetings to Olli Wittke # nrwtag11
Best pizza greetings to Kiel! Wish you good advice on network policy + Courage to set clever priorities instead of simple wish lists!
"@ e4Motion I would like to try it, but it would probably be a violation of the Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of torture) :-)"
"@gelsen Im Hauptbahnhof, 24/7. Get well!"
Also #ff @Volker_Beck @DoroBaer @DWoehrl @marlenemortler
#ff Member #e the @tj_tweets @jimmyschulz @halina_waw @ Özoguzaydan discussed until 02.15
"#ff Members of the #eidg, who discussed with me until 02.15 @JensKoeppen @larsklingbeil @ManuelHoeferlin @KonstantinNotz @petertauber"
@Rezisto The target is dramatically lower than last year. We only know later whether this also applies to the actual situation.
@Sven_kindler is about to speak in the final round of the budget debate. He certainly praises the government&#39;s great consolidation success!
@Farlion I&#39;ll check right away if he&#39;s still wandering somewhere in the apartment. :-) In the early morning he was in a really good mood!
"#eidg is a great team. Sometimes they get lost (real rooms), but have what it takes to make a big hit. Human &amp; professional great!"
"@yaguza She spoke clearly on both topics. In the case of government debt, we have only twice as much debt as planned."
@NeoXtrim She speaks topics like environment and human rights at least. Schröder just laughed about it ...
@rechtspfleger The chancellors are always responsible for everything! #General debate :-))
"Right-wing terror murders, euro, climate protection, Arab Spring: A.Merkel addresses the big issues. No party pole small-small! Sovereign."
The @SteffenBilger is chatting away state secrets again!
"@MichaelKreil That would depend on the wording. Therefore, some would prefer a decision of the BVerfG. Either will come."
@PirateDraugr :-))
@NorbertHuth With the agenda in 2003 he paid a high price for the 1998 propaganda.
@NorbertHuth I definitely think that propaganda alone will not be successful in the long run. See Schröder &amp; Agenda 2010 Folgt2
"@larsklingbeil Don&#39;t believe a word from @ThomasOppermann! The apartment is so small, not even all Saarlanders fit in! :-)"
@Jaufzug Of course you are something special: like every one of us! :-)
"@JFlour Thanks for the recommendation! Incidentally, I come from the neighboring town of Ensdorf and have some friends in Bous. Best regards from Berlin!"
"@NorbertHuth @TeraEuro I hope so! With a good balance sheet, no one needs to fear voters. :-)"
"@TeraEuro ch, you wouldn&#39;t write again and again! - :)"
". @ SebJabbusch yes, but 10 years ago the network was not as important as it is today."
"@ port80guru For me Libya, Tunisia etc are excellent examples of the importance of the network today. It goes on"
"@SebJabbusch The internet has been around for a long time, but it is developing rapidly + Many have not yet got it."
"@TeraEuro You often got some. But as you call into the forest, it resounds too! :-)"
"@Schmidtlepp Oh, Twitter frequency has been picking up again yesterday. But there are moments when that is not good for work or Twitter"
@SebJabbusch I don&#39;t underestimate anyone. But the development of the network is so fast + tremendous that it cannot be stopped.
"@Cyrus_McDugan We should let @Volker_Beck believe. By the way, a good teaspoon is also something fine."
@_nenya_ Without the cameras I would have really missed something! The Dutch now want to mount it on the border. Not even I think that&#39;s good.
"@twittycmf With the saying, the Crown Prince went swimming in the Empire. :-) But true: the adversarial process is often the best"
@ralphmakolla So: First comes the food and then the moral. #Eidg will teach me Mores. :-)
"@beapirate @ruedigerp Well, that&#39;s how it is if you don&#39;t have #VDS! (this is not a requirement now) :-)"
"@gormulus No Panic. Since I&#39;ve been on Twitter, I haven&#39;t asked anything at #VDS. The ideological rejection is also suspect to me."
"@ f4453 I do not know who it is, there is no name. Perhaps Green will file a criminal complaint, then the public prosecutor may investigate."
@SilkeGebel @JoernPL @maltespitz If you say so ... :-)
"@ruedigerp If you knew who the three were talking to last, you could possibly find accomplices and helpers."
"@jehof Sorry, had missed the name. You were there last week. London had irritated me! :-)"
"@HerbFlintstone If the quote is real, it&#39;s a mess!"
"@JoernPL Sure I read it. Praise mainly related to the linguistic style. In terms of content there is also good, unfortunately also green populism"
"@JoernPL If so, I have to meet @maltespitz for coffee; maybe he will write one for us! :-)"
"@jehof You sit in London after your account, but after your tweets you seem to be watching our rubbing pretty closely!"
@ f4453 I told you two hours ago that I don&#39;t share his view! :-)
@ f4453 You&#39;re in a great mood today!
@JoernPL Who wrote the green net paper? Linguistically good job!
@vertigonix you are one to me! Would you have said that if it had happened the other way round (20% pro vs 30% contra)?
@ebner_sha All Democrats can be found on the basis!
". @ bastianhaas You always know whether it was smart afterwards, but it was democracy and the opponents would have triumphed if the outcome had been different."
@Stefan_Urbat @rheto That is the only sensible attitude in democracy. The future will show what is right or wrong.
@Rezisto Do not grieve: That&#39;s the way it is with democracy. PS: I&#39;m not a big fan of referendums.
"@rheto Your opinion remains unaffected, but in principle. Rejection and protest should be over now."
"@codeispoetry Beware, euphoria threatens. I&#39;m happy with B90 net paper, but it is quite a wish list. There are no clear priorities."
@HerbFlintstone The CDU-CSU votes are not a faction or party account. And your link to the police action is unfortunately not working.
"@sebaso @EiselStephan I&#39;m - as usual - ready for almost anything. But only from February, due to appointments"
@Griepentrog Recommend &quot;Chefkoch.de&quot;
@konstantin_frbg :-))
@SvenVolmering :-))
"@Jaufzug Out of respect for the will of the people, I always hold back with forecasts!"
@SvenVolmering Too bad that N.Röttgen cannot read the tweets. You have to teach him this with this Twitter! # nrwtag11
@Mitgezwitschert I will definitely send greetings again! So much network commonality must be! :-)
"@ Twitter I hope that everyone will accept the result. Incidentally, it would be a difference whether quorum is narrowly or clearly missed."
"@konstantin_frbg Sure, it&#39;s about the train station. Because I have been in favor of this for years, I hope that CDU&#39;s efforts will be successful today"
"Hey, I&#39;m verified! Hope the tick also applies to my political statements! :-))"
@ port80guru I do that too. Hope everyone accepts the result. #irgendwannmussschlusssein
@Jaufzug :-))
@JElevator Sure. I did that last night with best pizza greetings on Twitter!
I wish my CDU friends good luck in BaWü today!
@huettemann @collegeofeurope From you anyway! :-))
@thomassteins beautiful 1st Advent! &#39;And not too much mulled wine! :-)
@ManfredMarkert :-))
"@ManfredMarkert Should stay that way. But my 82 year old. I always tell mother: if she wants to live 20 years, she has to be online!"
"@olewin Sorry, did something wrong. Try again tomorrow"
@svenseele These left are the devil. I probably mistyped it. Tomorrow the whole thing again!
I&#39;m curious what Th.Oppermann u V.Beck will tell me at the netzpol evening on Tuesday: http://t.co/ltjmj9
"@ziem super! I would stream the green Frakt.essions: If there are still voters left, I would let Trittin speak to the Netzpol!"
"@norberthense SPD and Greens see things differently, as friendly as they deal with pirates :-)"
@muffinm0erder :-)
@marcristau You&#39;re welcome! I&#39;m very curious how long pirates are transparent! :-)
"@norberthense If you do that, you will definitely get a lot of votes from SPD and Greens! :-)"
@jo_br Believe it is an authentic fake account! :-)
"I would also meet @FWhamburg when it is in Berlin, ... :-))"
"@marcristau That would be even nicer, we are not in the surveillance state!"
@woksoll Those who don&#39;t talk to others know much less! CDU designed.
"Today meeting + good conversation with @tirsales, the federal pirate. Looking forward to BPT + how pirates position themselves politically!"
Update @siegstyle TL! Yesterday the #eidg was with me for a great conversation and they tweeted what the TL holds!
@Volker_Beck there are those who do not want to know anything about the network or do not recognize its meaning
"@padeluun approval: In the end, the power of #eidg was right with your hands!"
@twittycmf plaintext always good if connected with understanding of the position of the other: he could be right (K.Popper)
"@Jaufzug can offer 2 entries: 1) Sweden, 2) Sweden / Netherlands / Switzerland. Assume that you know D yourself. Please email"
"Talked about everything yesterday with #eidg: Experts, employees, MdB: I&#39;m still very dazed: So many good unconventional thoughts!"
"Talking to #eidg last night was really good. Everyone says: The biggest challenge is network agnostics, which are still everywhere."
. @ Cyrus_McDugan I agree. But pleonasm is a stylistic device to underline the meaning of something!
"@sven_kindler There was no majority for that. If saving is important to you, you must not saddle up now."
@hellertaler Thank you very much!
"@JoergRupp I&#39;ll look at that. If it&#39;s true, we have to take care of it."
@SaarThomas @ arnoschmidt70 I agree!
"@HFeldhoff Not true: As State Secretary at the BMI, I made sure that 3 extreme right-wing clubs were successfully banned."
@LiterallySimon Am for principles. But in the current case it stinks to heaven + the helper / sympathizer scene has to be uncovered.
. @ world surveyor Everything is put through its paces. Doubts have to be removed.
@ImmerNurWollen One should not play left- against right-wing extremists. Both bad. The terror murders are the most disgusting thing in decades
"@Always only want democracy is always good, but let&#39;s discuss this separately, now it&#39;s about a lot more: #DefensiveDemocracy"
"@sven_kindler There are about 20 million + less was cut than usual. The decisive factor is what the money has done for 15 years, ie. the success."
@JoergRupp @sven_kindler What is that with the &quot;pi&quot;? Request clarification.
@LiterallySimon We&#39;ll discuss that later. But it really has nothing to do with the current case. First things first.
"@BenjaminDThomas Yes, everyone has to jump over their shadows. Compassion with victims + clear edge against right-wing extremists is crucial."
"@sven_kindler Sure: If the extremism clause hadn&#39;t come last year, the murders would not have happened 15 years ago! #Logic"
"@ arnoschmidt70 You will see that, rather not. But we need other structures + decisive action against extremism."
@gelsen Hermann Gröhe is the second speaker of the Union (after BMI)
We are currently working on a cross-party application against the brown neo-Nazis; BT debate tomorrow at 10:00!
@zeronegativ what do you mean exactly?
On the way to CDU-KPT Bad Dürkheim in Forst. I look forward to exciting discussion + Twitter friends
@tirsales what do you suggest instead for better law enforcement?
@tirsales We all agree. But auxch won&#39;t be able to do without law enforcement
"@kbojens No, no, no: that was an erroneous man who almost sent himself. Sorry @ review culture"
"In addition, debate on right-wing terrorism on Tuesday and indoor session on Monday."
We have the party and faction leaders. invited to a joint meeting for Tuesday at the BT. O
@kritikkultu. r st
@Zoor Probably we politicians also solve the problem: with verified denials! ;-)
@FlorianBuehler :-))
"@presseschauer Not just you. The pirates are an open-ended experiment, but it is quite successful in the beginning."
"@presseschauer @philipbanse Thank you for the chance, I am sure that network politics will change + develop strongly for all parties."
@sengeln @presseschauer I don&#39;t have a problem with that. Why should politicians be omniscient when everyone else isn&#39;t?
"@presseschauer During the interview, I was tired because I came from the party conference. But it was a pleasure because you could develop your thoughts."
"@cducsu I guess everyone made mistakes: that&#39;s why banks, agencies + states have to do something!"
"@world surveyor Sorry, judging by your tweets, I thought you were a lot older. Leipzig was the People&#39;s Party CDU at its best!"
"@weltvermesser &quot;Jubelperser&quot; is funny! I have often carefully examined my own positions. For example, Internet blocking. :-)"
@Freibeuter_arrr But we have to start with something. And FTT is best because many are in favor of it.
@NusquamNusquam Spending grows less than tax revenue + GDP. Will also incur less debt in 2012 than is stated in the budget.
"@andrs_mr German government bonds go away like hot cakes: less than 1% interest. FTT is against high frequency trading, which is bad."
@vilbi I think the British may still join in if they see that we are serious. :-)
"@ollistoer They relied too much on monoculture. But I am sure that the FTT will not be distributed, especially not from London."
@weltvermesser Klaus Peter Flosbach is really a super guy and has a super standing as a finance politician.
"@joaum And what the SPD has just taken over from us: market economy, Western integration, EU, stability, labor market reform ..."
"If the UK doesn&#39;t want to, we should do financial transaction tax in the euro area. One has to start."
I&#39;ll be live on BBC Newsnight on financial transaction tax. Some in the UK believe the world will go under if it comes. Is rather the opposite!
@habichthorn @buschsalat @Fran_Muc There is pol. Argument. I am thinking about a solution that is ok for both sides.
@Fran_Muc @habichthorn @buschsalat You don&#39;t have to want that. But Uhl + Friedr didn&#39;t say anything illegal.
"@AtariFrosch @docanonymous_ In the whole case, a lot seems dubious. Nevertheless Greens, SPD, CDU talk about right-wing terrorism + I agree."
@buschsalat @Fran_Muc @habichthorn I just learned that Wendt is with us! He only says what 27 EU countries have decided.
@matthi_bolte Thanks for the clarification. Excellent proof of swarm &#39;intelligence on the net! :-)
"@sekor It depends: If he wants recycled paper for the letters it&#39;s green, otherwise it is red."

"@mathiasrichel But you listened well. I am convinced that he will come soon, however."
"Thank you, dear @OnkelAndi, it was really fun. And I was allowed to talk too!"
@CDUBirkenwerder Almost everyone is satisfied. Some nope because we weren&#39;t as contentious as they wanted to criticize! :-)
"@Cyrus_McDugan Followerpower is a thing: If you have 4400, someone always knows what. @Volker_Beck will definitely be smart!"
@jfkorn :-)
@Saendralein &quot;Enquete Commission Internet in the digital society&quot;. One of the best kept secrets of the German Bundestag
@Jaufzug It really doesn&#39;t happen that often that I owe someone the answer ... :-)
@JoeRich_ You really give me ideas. :-)
. @ hideout &quot;Enquete Commission Internet in the digital society&quot; of the Bundestag. I always tell them that nobody knows that!
@jfkorn I would rather leave the hand-made speeches to our Northern German mood cannons in the inquiry commission!
I wonder what the # eidg people will teach me. Hope you don&#39;t shamelessly take advantage of my inexperience!
Wed # eidg people come to me: What should I offer besides cable + data salad: consensus sauce with brawn or rather peppered controversy?
@peterradebach If it serves the good cause: happy to work overtime!
@Cyrus_McDugan :-)
@sven_kindler That&#39;s the nice thing about the green housekeeping: Always for saving + take back all cuts! :-)
@tobiashans :-)
@tobiashans Best regards from Berlin to the deserved 6 friends from Neunkirchen!
@pikarl is rather the loneliness of the caller in the desert! I meet cross-party with Internet inquiry: It is going ahead.
@vonKlaeden Maybe we should give @petertauber a nice warm beaver fur hat for transportation! :-)
Congratulation! Now @petertauber can stand me up in the faction. :-)
@huettemann I have no idea what it&#39;s about: I didn&#39;t write it! :-)
"@derdiedie No. However, their findings are included in the constitution protection report. The Bundestag will examine its role closely."
@Pirat_Cain That would only be current if the Bundestag as a whole could no longer do its job. GsD is not likely to do this
@Pirat_Cain There was one in Bonn because the &quot;government bunker&quot; was nearby. It&#39;s been quiet since the move. The case is more theoretical. :-)
"@cherubimu Thank you, I was very happy! We have to talk about the party again: it really has it all! :-)"
. @ Volker_Beck This referred to the motto of @derschutzpatron who sees himself as a hiker between the worlds of Real. + Internet!
"@zeronegativ With amounts that are in SZ today, you take your head. V-people may never be financed in such a way that organization benefits"
@derschutzpatron Thank you for the flowers. It would be enough for me if you became a CDU voter in the real Werlt! :-)
@georgdingos What does &quot;wood&quot; mean here? Whole forests have to be drilled so that the British can participate! :-))
@ Mathis22 Because of &quot;announcement&quot; You just have to read your own report: # conjunctive! :-))

"@peterradebach In u after my speech we discuss euro, taxes, child-raising allowance"
@Energisch_ We will appreciate the victims. The Bundestag will debate next Tuesday.
@NusquamNusquam Da kann ich nur sagen: I certainly ...
Now the # cdupt11 begins and everyone wants to go to the network and Twitter meeting at 7:00 p.m.!
@b_torsten Unfortunately you did not listen: CDU was never essentially a conservative party: that was only part of our roots. See Adenauer / Kohl.
"@red_hardliner Wow, good idea! Perhaps I should ask the Internet community for a wish list of what should be on the homepage? :-)"
"@red_hardliner The new website comes with the blog. But that&#39;s harder than tweeting, that&#39;s why my employees are on it :-)"
"@ o0Phamos0o on FB I&#39;m not quite right yet, but I&#39;m considering it. What do you say?"
"@ o0Phamos0o Twitter ideal for politicians, because hdy can be used from anywhere. Short texts are great. Kriege zstzl blog for explanations"
@polypepper_p @petertauber Twitter is the icing on the cake: I recently wrote about network + politics in FAZ - contradiction desired! :-)
"@DasGuteessen @petertauber If you are nice, you are most welcome! #cntt"
@petertauber am curious whether all students will come to the network and twitter reception at 7:00 p.m. on Monday #cntt # cdupt11
@ o0Phamos0o Volker Beck agitates his followers here. In 140 Z I unfortunately cannot go into everything
@ o0Phamos0o not at all. Look at me. The line between sighted and blind people runs equally through all parties
@ o0Phamos0o PS: I differentiate between &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;neg&quot; trolls. Only the latter is problematic. Once I blocked someone
"@beandev If so, it needs to be clarified why. The case will occupy us very intensely."
"@ o0Phamos0o Yes, but less than 5 percent. of users who report. Twitter as a social network simply rewards &quot;nice&quot; and fair behavior."
@ o0Phamos0o Because you go!
@meselfandi Simply brilliant!
@ exilberlin3r real thing! You don&#39;t have the honor very often.
@meselfandi What exactly did he say?
@Dietmar_Bauer Really? That&#39;s a thing :-)
@quadratschaedel Everything is now on the wallpaper. Incredible that it could go on like this for years
@twitCaptain I don&#39;t get it either. It&#39;s pretty much the biggest scandal in the past 20 years.
"@woksoll When it comes to right-wing extremist-racist political goals, it&#39;s terror."
@woksoll But they probably have backers and sympathizers.
@BendlerBlogger Every murder is equally bad. Wants to know backgrounds so that danger can be averted.
@BendlerBlogger You can find out who you are by searching. I was as clueless as many + that&#39;s why I&#39;m angry now.
"On Friday it was criticized that I was talking about extreme right-wing terrorism. Everyone is talking about it now, including the Greens, because that&#39;s exactly what it is."
@Griepentrog Progress cannot be stopped! :-)
@joergkohl Have a good trip for everyone! And don&#39;t forget the network meeting on Mon 7:00 p.m. #cntt # cdupt11
"@sven_giegold sorry, read too quickly. Shorten a lot + everywhere, because: Save. Murder series raises questions, but not just those."
@sven_giegold Money is not &quot;for&quot; but &quot;against&quot; extremism. Terror murders must have consequences. Which one will be seen soon.
"@agoptron From 1982 onwards, the CDU, with the Minister of Post Schwarz-Schilling in Germany, implemented fiber optic cabling against SPD resistance"
@joaum the name is not mine but haunted the entire media
@Der_Kalle also the Interior Minister of NRW (SPD) called it &quot;right-wing extremist terrorism&quot; this evening
"@_Belze_ According to the police, it is a real right-wing extremist underground organization. Bad that nobody noticed."
@fire ink This is it. And it is a recognized linguistic stylistic device to emphasize this with an adjective!
@stefanklute That is completely indisputable!
@joaum I&#39;m afraid that can&#39;t be prevented because it&#39;s so memorable

@Jonny_Osbock Thanks :-)
"@twittycmf @cducsu At CDU / CSU, I&#39;m more interested in network and Twitter. Therefore also network and Twitter reception on CDU-BPT on Mon"
"@leskorp Yes, I have read it for a long time and congratulates Pavel Mayer. There is a lot to discuss in terms of content, for example on November 29th. #Politcamp"
@berlinsightsee I don&#39;t know. Each ministry acts in its own area of business and responsibility.
@BendlerBlogger #Liquidfeedback is a great thing when it comes to expertise and opinion. But an imperative mandate would be bad.
"@cducsu I find that everyone is now dealing with Twitter. The quality is different, but interest is increasing."
@drnweiss @DoroBaer It&#39;s all a great learning process: In 1 year the communication via Twitter will be much further.
@sebweigle fully agree
"@tirsales the others would have accepted that, but then Grie didn&#39;t want anymore"
@pottblog I have publicly criticized my friends from the ND often enough for their refusal. :-)
@ UrbanP1rate The problem was that no carrion knew beforehand + that the vote should only be in the spring.
@ Effect hit I&#39;m very much to help the Greeks. &quot;Responsibility&quot; means that Grie stands by what it has agreed with the EU
The nomination of Papademos is an encouraging sign that Greece is becoming aware of its own responsibility. Good day!!

"@Naturalism Yes, but if you have them, you cannot choose the results!"
@BetrVG I&#39;m afraid (even if I haven&#39;t seen it). From tomorrow on I won&#39;t eat anything! :-)
@ pgk1966 But go to London: cameras on every corner. And they also have a conservative OB who is very popular.
@ pgk1966 This is actually not my way. But just trusting in the good in people is unfortunately not enough.
@KonstantinNotz In the opposite. Our head start in terms of competence is clear. But I&#39;ll explain that to you tomorrow in peace!
"@der_MvG If we ask whether there are more or fewer cameras, a clear majority is always in favor. However, data should be handled strictly."
@ pgk1966 It is also worth something to me. That is why I am for the police and sufficient equipment.
@Naturalism I only said for my green friends who are always so good for referendums. :-)
@ki_naudiz Again tonight? Wow!
"@ pgk1966 We already had: I&#39;m for protection men, but you can&#39;t set many for the price of a camera."
"@Volker_Beck Have you ever posted, repetition will not make it more correct. Citizens think that security is in good hands with the CDU!"
"@presseschauer @Volker_Beck But since we don&#39;t want a surveillance state, the cameras are only evaluated if something really happens."
@Volker_Beck @presseschauer Good night and thanks for the praise for my Twitter presence! :-))
@ muffinm0erder There are also people who want cameras + police officers and others who neither want nor. Am for a reasonable mix
@ JohnDoe9277 He probably regrets that under red / green he always complied with Schily&#39;s safety laws! :-)
"@Volker_Beck The same applies to the cameras as usual: Good in moderation, but you shouldn&#39;t overdo it."
@Volker_Beck @presseschauer Volker Beck has trouble sleeping again. No wonder with the development of the green survey numbers!
"@MaxoSchaufhelt But you shouldn&#39;t listen to that. If he thought it was right, he could have done it in the constitutional convention."
"@presseschauer Actually yes, but do you have an idea how many teachers can be hired for the price of a video camera?"
"@MrZeabird I took care of foreign and European policy in the same way. In addition, plans for parliamentary treatment of brown terror."
@LucasF @philipbanse What is &quot;flutter&quot;?

@Mr_Harmlos You&#39;re right. But because of 24/7 you need 5 police officers for a camera. So you can never completely replace them
@TobiasHuch Nobody wants every corner. But there are already a lot of cameras today and nobody gets upset.
@ Kotzfrosch are also not a panacea but a useful addition to the overall approach

@TobiasHuch I don&#39;t know that anymore. Was in connection with Ford after video surveillance stations after gas bottle attack
@Mr_Harmlos With the Argum we would have to surrender completely. Violence can always evade. Parents often want to go to school with video cameras
@TobiasHuch I was told differently when I was still BMI State Secretary.
"@HerbFlintstone Unfortunately there is no one-size-fits-all solution but only a bundle of measures. Video is one of them, not more not less"
@Energisch_ agree 100 percent. But one does not rule out the other.
"@Dave_Kay When arguing with majorities, you have to accept that public opinion on the point is pretty clear"

"Now get me off the field. Greece tomorrow. As well as financial transaction tax: somehow everyone is for it, but nothing happened. Sleep well."
@Joerg_Werner :-)
@Joerg_Werner You have to like your opponents! And I would really like to be a horticultural engineer. Somehow plants are the more tolerant people!
@DoroBaer @tirsales Grrrrrrhhhhh! :-)
"@Joerg_Werner So with 1), 3), 4) you should be completely satisfied. There has never been so much content since Vita Sackville-West!"
"@tirsales Ja, supedr: 227-73542"
@Schmidtlepp And super: 227-73542
@tirsales @ki_naudiz We should definitely eat burgers together and drink mineral water.
@Schmidtlepp @wolfgang_thies Super happy. Now all you have to do is set the day and year.
"@Schmidtlepp @wolfgang_thies The later the evening, the better the offers! :-)"
@ki_naudiz Thanks for the offer. But I really don&#39;t want to compete @tirsales! :-)
@wolfgang_thies @Schmidtlepp So that was really something of something. It&#39;s not a century ago! :-)
"@oliverdasgupta I heard about it from the press - as it should be. Agencies, very traditional :-)"

"@KerstinGriese The @ThomasOppermann always wants to score goals, the @Volker_Beck agitates his followers + I am the only one who is right"
@ LINUS64 I did not pretend like my friend Volker Beck! :-)

@polypepper_p he is right :-)
@SPD_Saar @svnee :-)
"@SPD_Saar 1. Are you jealous, 2. It depends on &quot;when&quot; + &quot;how&quot;, 3. Has the SPD invented &quot;copy &amp; paste&quot; with the Godesberger program !!!"

@suchenwi I felt the same way in 1958. Adenauer was really good for D!
"@SPD_Saar I don&#39;t think we lost the compass, but at least the SPD hasn&#39;t found it yet! :-) Saarland greetings"

@jonasanner Sic! This is how it works: tens of people throw money into the piggy bank to later slaughter it with joy!

@BetrVG We say: &quot;orient&quot; on temporary work. You will see the rest. The current decision is not going to be easy
@Elfengleich So the CDU has long been for transaction tax. Angela Merkel pushed this forward 1 1/2 years ago.
@atradior Certainly not. The socialists are just starting to shoot at it. There is also something like that in many conservative countries
"@ABuschmeier @awillburger &#39;Yes, but there are areas where there are no collective agreements."
@DaGaula It is now a question of defining a CDZU position at the party conference. Only then can we talk to coalition partners in a meaningful way.
"@hellertaler It&#39;s not about temporary work, but about TV orientation. With Equal Pay there is of course also a need for action"
"@BetrVG It should be the case that lower wages wherever there is no TV. Orientation towards temporary work, that would be up to over 7.50 in the West"
"@awillburger belief in your tweet &quot;not missing&quot;? Wage moderation was ok for a long time, now there is limited scope thanks to good growth"

@Fran_Muc Many thanks: the strength lies in the calm: Who should believe us when we are always so hectic?
@FreytagFilm Thanks for the flowers. I always try to see things pramatically.
@marcsiegert I still feel like Alice in Wonderland here! Nice feeling and great atmosphere at the online talk shows
@kabukai @ZDFlogin @ZDFonline That was also the case and I am convinced that many Twitterers can remember it.
"@andi_b_muc It was really fun, even if I was a bit slack, after the whole day :-)"
@edomblog This is because you can only raise awareness of a topic if you don&#39;t immediately come up with the details.
"@dipead State list members are also elected members. Incidentally, around half of all MPs. And now I am directly elected."
"@ALietschulte Would have liked to have said more about the historical dimension, but time was short + I had to concentrate on economic issues."

@NazimKenan @ZDFlogin Not so long today because of the many &quot;side jobs&quot; that you still have on Twitter! Best regards
@Huwendiek Thanks to a great team for a great show.
"@red_hardliner Glad if I can help. Somehow crazy that so many are discovering it now, even though more than 100 MdB on Twitter"
@cdubasis what forecast?
@ThomasOppermann makes himself happy: for the majority this time we hadn&#39;t mobilized at all because requests from all factions
"@mrklrch compared to the last abst, we had 4 fewer votes: colleagues who were seriously ill or who were abroad like min ramsauer"
@seotologie on the bass we can agree
"@Cyrus_McDugan no, they came so late white cducsu + fdp negotiated until last night. Was often the same with red / green"
"I am also pleased that the coalition has achieved &quot;chancellor majority&quot; in the Euro vote, although colleagues were missing due to illness etc."
"I am very pleased that the CDU / CSU, SPD, FDP, Güne joint application for the euro was accepted by a huge majority: Good day for all of us"
@MTaege @Schmidtlepp @Volker_Beck @martindelius I recommend my article in the FAZ + my interview in the Sächsische Zeitung
@Volker_Beck @Schmidtlepp @martindelius Was no longer viuel! :-)
@wolfgang_thies Just because I say we want to win? This is also in the interest of the FDP.
"@Volker_Beck How do you get it? High growth, low unemployment are a great record for the CDU / CSU / FDP"
"@MaxoSchaufhelt Yes, of course: Because we credibly exclude Grie Default, he is also considered less likely in Italy"
@Volker_Beck always forgets what the Greens under Schily have been through for 7 years! :-) @Schmidtlepp @martindelius
@ danielmack Schaun mer times
@ThomasOppermann @Volker_Beck @martindelius I think @Schmidtlepp meant the SPD&#39;s ability to form coalitions! :-)
"@Schmidtlepp @ThomasOppermann @Volker_Beck @martindelius To be honest, I find that much smarter than red / green that are already binding"
@MaxoSchaufhelt The record high is because the Italian government is currently having credibility problems #Saving program
@MaxoSchaufhelt That was even wise. But it only works if banks are willing to substantially waive their claims.
"@danielmack How did you come up with this? I didn&#39;t invent the pirates. Incidentally, I want CDU to win in 2013. I think that&#39;s legitimate!"
@jonasrauber :-)
"@LucasGerrits Green i J 19983 were completely different party than today (exchange of offices, rotation, NATO, BWehr). Pirates will also develop"
@danielmack That&#39;s why they are project space (black box) for many. They have smart people and the swarm intelligence on the net helps them.
@wolfgang_thies I take pirates seriously today. But I take the rapid evolution of the Internet and its use even more seriously
@MaxoSchaufhelt The topic is in good hands with us and we stay on the ball.
@Elfengleich Even unions (egIGM) were strictly against it for years (due to collective bargaining autonomy). &quot;Industry model&quot; was the door opener
"@awillburger No, but we have &quot;social market economy&quot; + since 1949 economic pole. it makes sense because we rely on tariff partners."
@ONEDeutschland did not know that it was ad + I missed it. But it&#39;s really funny. in the matter fully my opinion.
"@Elfengleich &#39;In Germany, however, the matter was highly controversial. Now she has lost her fear for many."
@ 787_8 @schroeder_k @dorobaer :-))
@Elfengleich Can do that now because we are with the industry-specific. ML&#39;s good experience. So it becomes economical. compatible.
@koernerjochen we want tariff partners to determine that.
Minimum wage: Will be determined ´a good debate at the party conference + in the end there is a big step forward. Evolution always works

@ThomasMoeltgen Minimum wage: Good things take time. Seems the debates have paid off.
@ChaOzZzX I agree. It will be fun.

"@ Gutjahr Yes, it was a nice evening: Come and have a coffee."

"@ Schmidtlepp Well, then please bring the ice cream over there. Have already explained gestures on ZDF login. Great show, by the way."

"@DavidRSchuster Yes, consider broadband coverage to be essential. Realization flexible, crucial that DSL on every yard."

@Piratefuchs one by one. Just help widen the horizon of the network. Step by step
@UlrichKelber You know that I am structurally completely incapable of polemics! :-)
Volker Kauder made an aggressive decision: vote on EU summit in the Bundestag! Even if the budget is legally sufficient. Strong signal
"Just now with Andrea Nahles TV recording for Phoenix on Euro crisis, 22.15. Sometimes pleasantly factual + with very little polemics."
". @ Volker_Beck has too little to do, so many tweets during working hours! VDS does not currently exist in D, so there is no need to panic!"
"@red_hardliner That&#39;s right. The decisive factor is the dialog function, that is, that you respond to each other: # Two-way traffic"
@Volker_Beck VDS is currently not implemented in EU + in Germany. Discussion about the network and the correct procedure is just beginning.
@Volker_Beck Then I would have more F. than you. Seriously: Online / Qu.TKÜ are now possible with &quot;general inspection&quot; with consequences. 2

@sven_giegold We will discuss soon! :-)
@MTaege Grundstzl yes. But you have to differentiate between Rekap to increase your own capital and hedge against debt relief Grie
@Vbibelhausen Now the EU has decided on forced capitalization. More to come
Pleasing: EU decides that banks have to increase their capital by 100 billion on their own. Clear signal
@Valandir I think that nothing else came to mind to get into the headlines
@Blubser I have always campaigned for a modern drug policy! For example methadone. Left turns the wheel

"@beapirate Yes, suggestions are coming. But first meetings with #eidg, CDU network politicians (party congress), experts (e.g. CCC, Politcamp), also pirates"
@UrbanP1rate :-))
@ UrbanP1rate We also like to develop them in dialogue!
"@Vvvion I would not have thought of it, but the idea is not bad! :-)"
@Naturalism :-)
"@tmmd yes, but that&#39;s the way the world is. There are around 100 MPs tweeting, but the public is only interested now."
@ evilroli83 we are known to the people every 4 or 5 years! Responsible policies are not always popular
@larsbecker As an old EU official I know what should be done!
@Fjunchclick Good idea! I&#39;ll remember
@Huwendiek In my youth everyone knew that. But everything was still full of little giants and big dwarfs!
@marcifrebber you will still be surprised! #Hach
"@larsbecker After all, these are real quick reminders. I&#39;m sorry for you, but it&#39;s for a good cause: for Europe"
@JoReiter Thank you for the flowers! I also come from the JU + the best courses I did in Krettnich back then!
@Medienhoheit @Huwendiek Helmut Kohl is right: Europe and the euro are 2 sides of the same coin! Therefore: save!
"@HPXFilesFan @Huwendiek If we all help each other and everyone does their homework, nobody will go broke!"
@Huwendiek That is child&#39;s play: after the euro nothing comes for a long time and then comes the Mondo!
"@DeHucky @danielmack Actually, we always like to save everyone. only with football it does not work: FC Saarbrücken :-("
"@BrossT Up to now I have not used podcasts, but that comes step by step: Next a blog, then we&#39;ll see."
@biolatvia @Volker_Beck The &quot;Parliamentary Managing Directors&quot; keep the shop together and cooperate with other groups.
@gutjahr The joy of it on my side. Hopefully I&#39;ll bring good news from the Bundestag on EU voting.
Do everything so that the Telecommunications Act can be passed on Thursday. Prominent CDU network politicians will speak.
Today the PGFs tweet very little. Work non-stop + focused on good solutions for EU summit on Wednesday. Late evening details.
"@DWoehrl @Volker_Beck Yes, but this lot only affects the best of the best!"
"Echo on dino comparison was great! Looking forward to #DE! And besides, I&#39;m off now! Good night and see you soon."
"@Zoor @ Simon90L Here we are again on the topic: very much, but it will take another 2 or 3 weeks because my job is still there: See You! :-)"
@ Simon90L @Zoor Tweet No. 1000 is unfortunately missed. What is a #DE? I&#39;m still a learning system. thanks for congratulations!
@Blacky_Bayern Everyone will learn that
@sturek :-)
@sturek So it was with the mammals back then: great. But the dinosaurs dominated.
"@MaxoSchaufhelt is still open. If transaction tax only comes in the euro zone, EU budget will of course not work at all."
"@Zoor Ei, jei, jei: Into the pirate&#39;s cave, too many nice people? I have to take courage first! :-)"
@ Petereter that was just the highlight !!
@Cyrus_McDugan sic!
@UlrichKelber Don&#39;t believe a word of @ulrichKelber. It&#39;s a nice guy but he doesn&#39;t have it with the rules of procedure! :-)
@Runkenstein Super: then I can be very calm! :-)
"@Cyrus_McDugan of course I don&#39;t agree, but regardless of the content: respect for humor + creativity!"
@Piratefuchs You know each other like that! You were definitely one of us!
@jbuer last night when I came back to Berlin. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t manage to clean up the apartment ... :-(
@Freiittweeter :-))
@flueke My FAZ article was a shooting star. The big impacts are yet to come!
"@ronpatz doesn&#39;t matter why the dinosaurs are extinct. In any case, they are no longer there!"
@Runkenstein historically this is not entirely true: after 1945 the CDU was a completely new species with astonishing evolutionary capabilities
@ Haetscher I admit that if you see me you could get the idea! ... :-)
@flueke in the long run this is of subordinate importance ...
"@Volker_Beck @kluelz yes, but only if there is money from the state. They should help themselves now."
"@edomblog yes, are clever. But earlier SPD / Greens campaigned for legalization of &quot;soft&quot; drugs, now leftists for &quot;hard&quot; #difference"
Congratulations to @frederics for a successful portrait!
@Phil_Ot Biensur: Nothing less than it is well resurrected from the dead (bzgl Hermann Scheer) :-)
"@Piratefuchs The thoughts are free, but the reading glasses remain on the woman (or on the man)!"
@JURLP Preussen is still alive !!! :-)
@beapirate Seemingly senseless tweets make understanding easier than scholarly papers! Read you! :-)

"@Phil_Ot there were many reasons, not just that. But does not work with 140 characters. I&#39;ll have a blog soon"
@MaxoSchaufhelt Every country can leave the EU as often as it wants. UK application but no chance even in UK parliament

"@triplesmart overall, I would like us to take a more determined stance against drug growing and trafficking. Eg Asfghanistan"
"@hdsjulian attac was really good, you were ahead of your time ..."
@hdsjulian I&#39;m glad that you are interested in politics as a young person. Better a different opinion than none at all!
@hdsjulian Liberalization in the Netherlands didn&#39;t do it any better!
@TimRozenski You also have to fight in coalitions. I am firmly convinced that it will come
"@TimRozenski I agree 100 per cent: eg financial transaction tax, if necessary also without GB"
@erFnord :-))
@Dave_Kay :-))
@mgzie :-))
@Leibowitz Like most. If you work with addicts: respect! Too little is still happening for that
@der_demagoge They are probably afraid that the left one will come to Bavaria :-)
"@helmi if I think about how often my CDU is leveled in the course of a day, I&#39;m still humble ... :-)"
@MTaege Hasch has long been liberalized in the Netherlands. Maybe Wilders ...
@UlrichKelber He didn&#39;t vote at all because SPD had already stretched out in advance. Was also not expedient :-)
"@hdsjulian I am also in favor of modernizing drug policy, for example more help for those affected. But Left makes problem worse"
"@ sokz42 Unfortunately, the decision of the Left Party was unconstructive and I only thought of something pseudo-funny ..."
"@ DosOz42 Fortunately I ride a bike, at least quite often ... :-)"
"@presroi maybe it is also the concern about a government participation of the left, especially since most of the visitors are not from Bavaria :-)"
@erFnord I&#39;ve seen quite different Netzkasper! :-)
@ sokz42 thank you
@Fjunchclick That will change when we start talking to the pirates :-)

"@GeorgDingos When it comes to prohibiting uncovered short sales, we have advanced nationally. But in general we have to act together in the EU"
@GigiPhilostra We&#39;re just getting started. Was a compromise with other EU countries. D would have done more now.
"@IforInformation Increasingly critical, especially among young people. Left Party is 20 years back by resolution"
"@edomblog wagenknecht is blatant, but siue is not part of serious politics"
"@HM_DiKS Don&#39;t say that. Cdu / csu is still the strongest party, even in polls."
@FabSP Don&#39;t overdo it!
@Volker_Beck decision on leverage together next week. Hope reason and consensus are maintained across parties.
@Volker_Beck Have achieved that parliamentary rights have been respected + decisions carefully prepared. Decide the next steps tomorrow
@Volker_Beck was a really nice evening. didn&#39;t always ask questions like my green friends!
@ world-famous It&#39;s great that you still know who Hans Katzer was! It&#39;s been a while!
Care before haste: Resolutions at EU summits only if good results and sufficient participation in parliament are ensured.
"@ gAndy84 I don&#39;t know who owns the account. The party and the faction are not, nor is the official logo. #Freedom of speech"
@beapirate @Volker_Beck That&#39;s right! If the people had only seen it that way with red / green: :-)
@beapirate @Schmidtlepp It also has to be clarified who is the chef and waiter in the water preparation.
@trotzik @Piraten These hashtags are the devil! #Piraten
@ekindeligoez Much better: @peteraltmaier is &quot;The Black Corsair&quot;
@Schmidtlepp @beapirate mineral water maybe ... :-)
@beapirate I&#39;m happy
How about if we as &quot;PGF colleagues have a coffee? Then I&#39;ll tell you which @Pirates I know or will
@ManuelHoeferlin @tmmd The best is a round. Let&#39;s talk this evening when the young group comes.
@Zoor @Schmidtlepp And never so. But @Schmidtlepp also understands a nice word. :-)
"@HeptaSean In the tweet, @Schmidtlepp did not get excited about Uhl, but about my statement. He particularly likes it."
@edomblog citizens have the right to be suspicious
"@beapirate also takes time because I have to be there as a 1.PGF for pretty much EVERYTHING, not just the network :-("
@TeraEuro Moin!
"@BendlerBlogger If everyone throws molds, it doesn&#39;t matter who started! :-)"
@ gAndy84 Everyone can make a mistake! And irony is of course allowed.
"On the contrary: the more factual the arguments, the greater the pressure for clarification. Could have been more precise today .."
@schirmi I&#39;m already there: See my article in the FAZ. Other initiatives will follow.
@TwittingThom I&#39;ve known the HP Uhl for a long time + we&#39;ve achieved a lot of good things together. Does not rule out individual differences.
@_nenya_ Good observation! Those who participate on Twitter - whether politicians or not - are generally more tolerant + open
@kaifuzius That is your right. But I generally want to start thinking. That doesn&#39;t take and doesn&#39;t happen overnight.
"@realgiggls If the court agrees and all requirements are met, it is ok. Whether it was like that is currently being checked."
@michaelcrass Thank you very much. It&#39;s not always easy! :-))
@Fischblog At Green / Left / SPD there was also polemics + prejudice. Overall was not a real great moment.
@Valandir Although I had a lot to do (Euro) I heard &quot;all&quot; speeches + was also in the plenary at times. The debate continues.
@zonkinoff CCC was not polemical. But he can above all technology (I praised it) + not judge constitutionality with authority.
@_Belze_ Good question: We don&#39;t have both.
@MTaege With tactics you won’t win a choice. That is why parties struggle for positions. The CDU / CSU does the same and is no shame
@ sokz42 ignorance u lack of understanding on both sides. THESE are the &quot;parallel worlds&quot; that I described in the FAZ.
"@tirsales You will see whether it was a violation of the law and then act, but that does not decide @tirsales :-)"
@Schmidtlepp I&#39;m not surprised: There are also pirates who prefer tough party politics rather than looking for solutions. :-)
"@Cyrus_McDugan It was definitely not the only one. Depending on their point of view, many find polemics good or bad."
@tirsales I still think that we should refrain from hasty preliminary commitments. Data protection report is coming.
"We will show that network freedom, the rule of law and internal security are possible together. This includes dispensing with polemics from everyone."
We will show that network freedom + r

"@ fm1304 This is a solution that is common in the USA but has not helped there. Nevertheless, I am open to it if the advantages are clear"
@jo_br @holgi Now one of you has to explain to me exactly what that is. :-)
@tomaschek We can still get PGF to find a decent place here somewhere. Perhaps state representation.
"@ UrbanP1rate @Valandir Yes. unfortunately, politics still has no answer on how to prevent banks from being &quot;systemic&quot;."
I am very pleased that the politcamp will take place on November 29th. stands. Maybe you can help prepare for this on Twitter
@TeraEuro We don&#39;t want that right now. Others around the world do the printing of money. We have avoided that so far.

@StefanMoch Friday or Saturday
@helmi For 2 hours I&#39;ve been writing my fingers sore: just read .. :-)
"Incidentally, today an exciting interview was made with the Sächsische Zeitung about the Internet and politics. Public interest is growing."
Thanks also for the willingness to discuss + exchange arguments is great fun despite 140 Z! I usually don&#39;t have it on TV either
"After about 60 @replies I&#39;m done. Hope I didn&#39;t block the TL. Not everyone is satisfied, but politics is a process"
@holgerschupp Because the others are http: // eg in committee meetings or in hearings. Or in citizen talks.
@rvrscm I want to do that too. But in democracy politics is never done by one alone. And you need majorities.
@Naturalism I would like to ask you! ... :-)
@musevg @tmmd But now hardly anyone doubts that. And many have already convinced themselves of it.
@tmmd I have been promoting this for weeks and also do it: soon I will have #eidg at my home + I will also speak to many others. Thank you

"@nutellaberliner I&#39;ve been on Twitter for 3 weeks, but I&#39;m not that smart. It will be clarified."
@Vbibelhausen greeting back. Politicians are fighting on many fronts! :-)
@thetaphi @tirsales I am now &quot;network savvy&quot; but I am also a lawyer and know that the assessment is very difficult.
@Oreo_Pirat @hellertaler Nobody said. And we don&#39;t yet know whether it was a violation of the constitution.
@MTaege Internal party debates are one thing + necessary. But citizens publicly expect a clear position from us.
"@Naturalism Yes, but for that we need common positions."
"@Naturalism You can do that at any time if you think so. As a PGF, I cannot censor the faction speakers."
@holgerschupp :-)
"@MTaege I knew and appreciated them. But in the end, not many people listened to her because she was mostly alone."
@HeinzHaraldF That will be adopted next week (Thursday). Report me in detail.
"@tobiasraff Oh, Oh: I gave it on Monday evening: Was the responsibility of the Berlin police, who acted alone, without the Bundestag"
"@ victor5679 Yes, I know that too. But in the end, each party + parliamentary group must agree on a common line. We are working on that."
@der_demagoge Thank you for the demagogic encouragement!
@frederics FDP has it much easier because it does not represent the Minister of the Interior neither in Bavaria nor in the Federation + therefore does not have to justify itself
"@frederics @marcelstuht Of course, but not in a specific case, as long as everything is not cleared up."
"@MaxoSchaufhelt You can never rule out everything, but make the occurrence of risk less likely."
@jensbest @gutjahr As you can see: Politics means staying power.
"@hellertaler All parties, including the SPD and the Greens, make sure that you take your own protection and don&#39;t drop it immediately"

"@pottblog They have a lot to say, but the question was whether police action (Trojans) was lawful. Domestic politicians responsible for this"
@henrikMSL No faction wants to offer the SC game of different opinions. And domestic politicians are responsible
. @ ozaed is not a strategy. But opinions are different + the two parallel worlds have been around for a long time
@Raider_MXD People see it differently depending on their point of view. It is crucial that adss education continues. &#39;That was the beginning of the debate
"@Throki No, HP Uhl has given his opinion + faction. Debate over #ozapftis continues when it is clear whether + what was unconstitutional"
". @ hellertaler I am concerned with a new access to network policy. To do this, we have to interlink the &quot;parallel worlds&quot; (my FAZ article). Lasts"
@deBaernd The spread of the Internet is unstoppable! And yet people&#39;s opinions are and remain different.
"@hellertaler Yes, he spoke for our group, even if not all 237 CDU / CSU MPs agree with everything."
. @ marcelstuht Right to speak applies to everyone and HP Uhl is responsible for domestic and legal policy.
@Carbidfischer Hans Peter Uhl is our inner pole spokesman + with it for online D. + TKÜ source of the responsible.
My account is still intact. Report me in detail in about 1 1/2 hours of flat share session
@ PsychoTR0N You&#39;re in a good mood today! Will make sure that gamble comes to an end. It wasn&#39;t worth it at GRie
@TeraEuro I tried to orient myself on what we discussed. After debates in parliamentary groups etc direction is slowly becoming clear.
"@ PsychoTR0N e.g. Europ. Rescue fund, aid measures for GRie, Irl, Portugal, now it&#39;s about banks and again about Grie"
"@ PsychoTR0N I see it differently: previous summits have achieved a lot, prevented collapse + developed solution step by step"
"@deochs I agree 100%. We have to act prudently: bank self-help has priority, not lost grants"
@Valandir Banks that cannot do this only get credit if they are &quot;systemic&quot; + only against state property rights.
". @ Valandir I would like us to go one step further: First, no state bailout, banks have to recapitalize themselves"
@ nati0n We also think that 21% is not enough. Deshsalb is now being added.
"@ PsychoTR0N We will see: banks are not funny, but politics sets the framework. Expect a clear signal from the EU summit on Sunday"
"@AlexKoenigMdL Faith can move mountains: GR could be saved when serious about unbundling, liberalization, privatization"

"@RainPMV Everyone is challenged + you have to know the mutual constraints. Will now invite #eidg to me, informal + without TO."

"@seewolfDE Sure I am: electricity can be produced independently, the Internet cannot!"
"@levudev are at the beginning of the discussion about legality and consequences. For source code, difference between disclosure and deposit."
"@edomblog If everyone took this to heart, politics would have a few problems less."

"@JoergArweiler That sounds pleasantly pragmatic: Well, Saarlander"
@sven_giegold Would like to get to know you personally. If you are soon in Berlin.
@citoyenberlin You hereby speak to me from the heart
@Trias_ Europ Finanzpol is doing very well with the CDU. Eurobonds difficult in the foreseeable future because the desire to save is not yet everywhere #Berlusconi
@felixno I always get very dull about bankruptcy
@quadratschaedel International financial transaction tax could slow down high-frequency trading. Would affect holding periods
@twittycmf Reducing system relevance is an unsolved problem and must be addressed

"@ben__schaefer I think so too. Principles are important, but it is very easy to trigger domino effects by collapsing"
"@Rainer_Klute Applies to Ackermann &amp; Co, but no longer to HRE, Landesbabnken + Sparkassen"
"@ aotto1968_2 Not the only answer, but an interesting aspect. Banks made a lot more in bubble than they used to earn with interest"
"@PSchonard I talked about development in 5 or 10 years. Today about 100 MdB tweet, very diverse. The best way prevails"
I have to check @stefanklute
@MJaegerT Welcome! As a former minister you know how to be brief! :-)
@kritikkultur Tomorrow will set time and place for Twitter meeting at party congress! I&#39;m looking forward to it!
@PSchonard Develops O should not be prevented. Interested voters will be on the net + get involved vigorously
@michaelcrass True: Question Time is an instrument of opposition
@michaelcrass @StefanKaufmann Depends on what the Twitter community does with it. See enormous development potential
"@stefanklute Money for electricity has always been included in the Hartz IV social assistance rate and, since the 2011 reform, has also included a flat rate for the Internet"

Happy birthday @marlenemortler !
"@tirsales did you marry yourself? In that case, congratulations !!! Yours Peter Altmaier"
@Cyrus_McDugan with me there is not much left to split! But accuracy is important: on both sides.
Thanks for about 70 tweets to banks (+ many links). Take a closer look at me tonight + sign up again!
@Pirat_JMaurer let&#39;s see. Clarification continues: Wednesday current hour u Question time in the Bundestag.
@Schmidtlepp I think you are wrong: He had said that BKA did not use the trojan tested by the CCC.
@fdoemges wanted S.Kauder (strikes). But I don&#39;t see a chance for that
"Say exp, prefer Basel III (ie more equity) + valuation of government bonds at market price. Then there is a risk of collapse"
I am interested in: Should banks be obliged to provide greater capital backing against their will? + should the state help then?
@stagerbn I see no need and the GG is sacred to me!
@StefanKaufmann It seems to me that you are clearly talking too much! :-)
"@domainrecht yes, but we all create reality in this way. W is not only a condition but also a product!"
@sebastiank @herrurbach @habichthorn I definitely don&#39;t. I can do well with her.
@drbieber FAZ-Feuill is particularly interested in network issues. Basic questions just there
. @ christiansoeder That is why I prompted the SPD to speak out for it without need! :-)

"@fbahr Unfortunately not right: swarm intelligence works quite well with primitive individuals, with intelligent ones it becomes gigantic"
@_Belze_ In the CDU I have been fascinated for 35 years + that she always finds answers (if not always immediately).
@ClemensvN Exactly like that!
@NusquamNusquam Naive ?: Nemo ultra posse tenetur! The network changes power structures + this is not a question of power but of evolution
I also see @netzwerghh. Hamburg CDU is doing quite well on Twitter!
@edomblog that&#39;s why we call ourselves the people&#39;s party: we give all types of people GsD
@smrqdt Addiction is always a problem that most addicts don&#39;t even know they are. I&#39;m already attached! :-)
"It&#39;s not about whether the CDU or pirates get 2 per cent more / whom, but about a change in the world that is faster than climate change"

@CSU_net Thank you! Firstly for the friendly comments + secondly for the great work on the net!
"@Laberlohe yes, tweeting is as nice as driving the S-Bahn after a long day at work!"

". @ sebastiank Sure, I incited the SPD, the EP, the Commission, the member states, the Bundestag and the Federal Constitutional Court!"
@jolyonwagg1 This is merely a prejudice. Brussels has liberalized markets in EU and most of the new regulation is replacing MS-regulation
"@oliverdasgupta But the big end is inevitable, and then you better have a strategy."
@SteinbachErika :-)) Happy Advent Sunday!
"@Schmidtlepp I was too stormy and almost accidentally deleted your nick, sorry!"
@Der_Kalle Thank you. The network is indeed there for everyone. That&#39;s why there is room for a few of us CDU students
"@aprica good idea, look what can be done. We have to talk about it anyway"
"@baranek Thanks for all the flowers. But hope that real debate gets underway, even among non-nerds"
@Rakkox i like early 20th century books + early 21th century webs!
@ennomane It always depends on who determines the strategy! :-) #fail external control

@nico_kirch I&#39;m happy!

"@MichaelJaegerTV I&#39;m not so sure. Parties must be systems that can learn, otherwise they will sooner or later have problems"
@OAGIS Don&#39;t think the other factions are way ahead of us. Everyone has to learn!
@XiongShui we are a big people&#39;s party. And hopefully also capable of learning. #CDU
@CowboyOfBottrop They know why!
@ Kons1982 sorryn that was just for @deppentoeter. Fascho was younger (at times) but the saying was good
@ Kons1982 you get too. But basically no answer without a question! ... otherwise we just talk :-)

@Farlion :-)
"@Dandii Thanks for the tip, but I&#39;m always sorry if I can&#39;t answer questions for hours. V.Beck always has free rein :-)"

"@Opp_Sprecher Pizza is difficult, but I can offer you filled dumplings!"
"@Volker_Beck @Opp_Sprecher That&#39;s right, pizza never, the Greens were very spoiled back then"

@scanlines Fiery arguments look different: I always say: We need compromise with which both sides can live.
"@presroi &#39;is an old argument. Found the blacky okay, but it&#39;s not a question of principle. Stupid that so much of the # IT stuff from China"

"@YoungSocialist if it happens before the government deposits the instrument of ratification, that&#39;s no problem. After that it is difficult"

"@Farlion Habs just read it, but I was very happy. The communication aspect is really exciting, it&#39;s also fun! Thank you"
"@mplusk_ Given my current size, this could also be achieved by cell division. :-)"
"Help! I&#39;m currently not twitterable, because speakers in Mönchengladbach + then on the plane. Get in touch."
@YoungSocialist Don&#39;t do it because it doesn&#39;t work. But in Slow it was clear from the start that third vote would probably be successful.
Thanks for today. Unfortunately I still have to do: # late shift :-(
@littlewisehen All democratic parties should be able to form coalitions with one another. Only with Linke I make exception #faildemocracy
@Sput Your initial thesis was that Schäuble was responsible for these laws + was overturned by the BVerfG. Objectively not true. #Bad luck
@NusquamNusquam I&#39;m not afraid: Those who are strong in their convictions need not fear the dialogue with others.
"@ Haetscher I suspect myself, but it doesn&#39;t have to be right. #Copyright"
"@Sput Should have said: VDS no longer law. Nevertheless, Zypries (SPD) minister responsible. The must ensure GG conformity."
"Because there are no good and bad parties, there are only good and bad Democrats."
"If you eat green pizza &amp; tweet with pirates, you can be a good CDU student! (Reply to Opp spokesman) :-) follows 2"
@vertigonix @Sput It is important who exactly made the wrong law. Not peeling right now + I was his State Secretary at the time!
"@Sput Oh, oh, badly wrong: VDS was Zypries (SPD) + is not yet a law, plane firing was Otto Schily (SPD), online through. was NRW (FDP)"
@ Haetscher As &quot;problem&quot; I meant oppression ...
"@Haetscher That would also work across parties: one for Syria, one for Bahrain, one for Yemen etc. Sometimes it works in the EP."
@Haetscher There are many countries and many problems. Must create that individual MPs are identified and featured with a country.
@ Haetscher Are we doing enough as D?
@Sput certainly doesn&#39;t want them. But is also responsible for #security. Not unimportant. None of Schäuble&#39;s laws have been repealed
"@mgzie So.So. The food invitations are of course self-serving: as a host, I have to go with a good appetite. :-)"
"@EinBug @presroi On the other hand, at Blacky I now know how to use the umlauts - if it works."
@sven_kindler @YoungSocialist @awillburger I think so too: A parliament can decide as often as it wants: #Democracy
@Haetscher @pettre What actually came out of Bahrain?
"@impactsuspect As I said before: With today&#39;s life expectancy, however, everything can still come."
"@Sput In the end, BVerfG always decides, which does not get all laws equally"
"@Sput Yes. But if it says, for example, human dignity, the experts argue what that means in concrete terms. Therefore #Gesetz makes sense. Follows 2"
@ostpirat Have a good future cooperation!
"@pettre @Haetscher That with the Juso can go away again, I wouldn&#39;t worry about that! :-)"
"@turbotommi So nothing against your parents, but for over 70 they are really exceptional. Otherwise almost all CDU vote! (But not just that)"
@mgzie Then I&#39;m reassured. As long as I don&#39;t have to slim down ... :-)
@christiansoeder I saw him in the Bundestag. Really a number but sometimes we moaned.
@flobraun Then I don&#39;t know Cologne yet. let me give it from Hermann Gröhe.
@Sput law should clarify what the state is allowed to do without violating fundamental rights.
@ dck800 Greens are also no longer as before. Just try to answer the questions that are getting more and more !? Therefore: blog soon
"@Valandir My staff take care of it. However, it should have a comment function"

"#Trojaner: Now the finance minister has also clarified. 16 cases at customs, but probably other software. If legality ... 2"
Good evening. Wg BlackBerry was pretty Twitter-free today. Probably shamelessly took advantage of @KonstantinNotz + @Schmidtlepp.
"@ben__schaefer Actually yes. It took 40 years, but at least."
"@helmi logo. Incidentally, the problem for politicians is to link tweets, emails, SMS, online media, print, TV in such a way that there is still time for clear thoughts!"
"@helmi That means something: With 41,426 own tweets! :-)"
@ostpirat :-)
@PSchnieder I am also fighting for the honor of the Greater Region! Thank you good night
"Friends, it&#39;s a lot of fun, but I&#39;m getting out of the field now. We&#39;ll talk to you about it more often! Many thanks! Read you."
@Valandir Of that too. And from the useless economic stimulus programs. Fought against it. But &#39;unreasonableness was stronger.
@seitic&#39;s main problem is that most of it only works internationally and there are still a lot of brakes
. @ josh_k_phisher @Dave_Kay @ PsychoTR0N So you can&#39;t accuse me of refusing dialogue :-)
@Farlion But they were due because the United States unfortunately allowed Leeman to go bust.
"@turbotommi #Charm I find good, #Uncle very bad because of # old &amp; troubled, # momentarily is wrong, just wait! :-)"
@RainPMV We dare. Nevertheless: bankruptcy of a &quot;systemic&quot; bank sweeps everything away. Now everyone sees it that way.
"@Valandir Should not be exaggerated. Grie needs structural reforms, better administration and unbundling. What we did in D."
"@Valandir We have shown our teeth a few times to banks: for example, when the uncovered teaching sales are prohibited. Was spot on."
. @ levudev Discuss Euro with the community right now. Offer: Trojans again tomorrow.
"@Farlion That&#39;s right. If we hadn&#39;t had all the debt since 69, we would have had to spend 50 billion less a year. Would be a paradise for education"
"@Schmidtlepp Well for the TKÜ sources, says Burkhard Hirsch (Liberal Liberal). I tell you yes."
"@kluelz No, but politicians also belong to the people! Mostly :-) Schröder won 98 with great promises + then did the opposite."
@lars_haise We are much more at CDU / CSU: @DoroBaer @DWoehrl @petertauber @marlenemortler @tj_tweets @NadineSchoen + gaaanz many others
"@ostpirat Yes, they were as blind as economists + rating agencies. Politics must now pay for it."
@Valandir have so-called Merkel. &quot;Rich tax&quot; (plus ESt) introduced. Now want financial transaction tax against high-frequency trade
@ThorstenRinne The problem is that we have to choose a certain system among each other # Networking capability. Just take a look.
"@Dave_Kay Unfortunately not indisputable. It doesn&#39;t just depend on us. Berlusconi, for example, is doing a lot of wrong right now."
@jakuuub Now think that you can do a lot of serious things with Twitter. Because people participate that you would otherwise never find
@Valandir I&#39;ve already answered the @psychotron
"@SusanneButz Yes, you have to get involved with Twiter, otherwise it will be boring (not only for the others) :-)"
@dorsalis For today it&#39;s over. Until tomorrow!
@awillburger &#39;Unfortunately there are economists for everything + everything: for saving + spending money!
@Valandir Denen lights up yet
@Farlion Education is GsD the only area where we have not saved in the federal budget but increased spending.
". @ Dave_Kay Above all: I don&#39;t know a better concept, not even from Pelzig :-))"
"@flobraun Yes, CDU NRW was very helpful. Old pro-Europeans :-)). It has always been like this."
". @ Dave_Kay There is no model for the crisis. But is debt crisis, so they have to go down: by saving. Otherwise they have to cushion the crash"
@weltvermesser @vertigonix @_JennyGER_ I agree. But US boys want us to print even more money. Not possible.
"@kluelz Unfortunately, the people voted for them because the one who promises the most wins. Unfortunately. But save since 2005 anyway."
"@Dave_Kay Didn&#39;t say anything bad about the pirates myself. But: you are the children of the network, not his fathers."
@Dave_Kay @ PsychoTR0N We&#39;re trying hard. You don&#39;t believe how many of us are tweeting! :)
"@Dave_Kay @ PsychoTR0N White. But if I can only have 140 Z, at the end people think I&#39;m one-dimensional"
. @ vertigonix @ PsychoTR0N I recently visited Friedmann too - and survived quite well.
". @ PsychoTR0N So far, the &quot;little ones&quot; have not paid anything in Germany, only investors + speculators. Banks have to be put up with Greece."
". @ awillburger When Leeman went bankrupt, we saw episodes. But we introduced a bank levy and banned teaching sales."
@Dave_Kay must convince a few thousand MPs + 500 million people.
"@Dave_Kay I hope so too, with his salary! But politics is not stupid either. &#39;It&#39;s only really difficult when you have 27 states."
. @ PsychoTR0N Yes. But it is difficult with 140 Z. That&#39;s why I now get a blog. Angela Merkel spoke well at Jauch.
"This includes that the global economy must not drown, as it did in 2008. We have done so far. Main problem: debt since the 1970s"
"Ah, who recommended the furry to me before. He has good questions but no responsibility. I am convinced that we have to save Euro + EU"
@ PsychoTR0N Your link doesn&#39;t work?! :-)
@ PsychoTR0N is indeed changing a lot. Think nobody can assess the consequences yet. Enormous expansion of reality. Just the beginning.
@ PsychoTR0N honestly wish good luck. But the Greens always wanted that 30 years ago. Unfortunately it didn&#39;t take long ...
@ostpirat You are a bitch! You wanted me to explain this to &quot;the Uhl&quot;! Assume you know Carl Schmitt quite well yourself!
@levudev Got it. But then one would have to give JM executive powers to deal with prosecutors. and Richterlfkt. bites. Think about.
@EmanuelKotzian @ PsychoTR0N @piratorama But feel free to look at the experience of pirates + I&#39;m willing to learn.
"@EmanuelKotzian The debates in the BT are always public. Party conventions too. But if there were committees + factions, more deals would be secretly"
@Trailerjunkie @schmidtlepp :-)) !!
"@Tannador I&#39;m not resentful, but the topic is serious too. And 140 Z are a challenge for precise arguments anyway. HG"
"@quarkmitsauce That will be clarified. If it was administrative assistance, it is different from acting independently, but that comes up on the table."
Federal Minister Friedrich has sent a clear signal: Stop the Trojan until further notice. Enlightenment is advancing + sensitivity is increasing.
"@ostpirat Occasionally ask for suggestions on what to say :-). Location description is simple, but unfortunately there is no one-size-fits-all solution."
@Schmidtlepp FAZ is also on Twitter today &amp; did a really good job with #Trojaner. &quot;Twitter-Connection&quot; comes from @pettre #UrheberR
@josh_k_phisher I don&#39;t know more than the 16 cases either. And BMI statement that only TKÜ + program ok. Everything else is coming
"@mgzie It&#39;s a demand, not a statement!"
@ralphmakolla @Schmidtlepp @pc_org Anytime and happy!
"@himselforama @schmidtlepp You shouldn&#39;t either. But if everyone always knew the border clearly, you wouldn&#39;t need dishes at all"
@vieuxrenard @fukami The old problem: Every weapon can be used for both defense and attack. Defense is still necessary
@Schmidtlepp Don&#39;t panic: I don&#39;t like to be surpassed when it comes to protecting freedom and fundamental rights. I would be happy to have a public debate
@Schmidtlepp Now that&#39;s a claim. BVerfG limits must be adhered to when used. It remains to be seen whether this is possible
"@ PsychoTR0N @piratorama .. often in the newspaper the next day, which was given confidential advice :-)"
"@ PsychoTR0N @piratorama .. otherwise easy prey for political opponents, who then exploit vulnerabilities. But &quot;us&quot; also says .."
"@ PsychoTR0N @piratorama Thanks for the link. Partly watched me, it was exciting. Fear that pirates won&#39;t last long"
"@fukami But the other way around is also difficult: Who calls over the telephone network, must count on TKÜ, who does not make calls over Internet et"
@Volker_Beck @ThomasOppermann We will ensure that the topic is sufficiently discussed in the Bundestag.
"@fukami Sure, we also have methods + solutions for this (eg &quot;Judges&#39; Band&quot;) At Quellen-TKÜ it has to be that way too."
"@ PsychoTR0N My experience: crouching does not help. This applies to all &#39;parties + people. PS: On the net, I am used more often :-)"
@asp_net You say that correctly: &quot;In case of illegality&quot;. You will see.
"@inpressulum Yes, and if ioch understand BVerfG correctly, then that is not possible. But Bavaria says everything is ok + that&#39;s exactly what needs to be clarified now."
@rainerSpunkt Not too much. But there can always be isolated cases + they are punishable.
"@Schmidtlepp Because in principle at Quellen-TKÜ. other things too, BVerfG has set strict limits. They have to be respected."
"@Schmidtlepp There you stand against the BVerfG. TKÜ has always been legal, so you cannot generally exclude source TKÜ. Follows 2"
"@rainerSpunkt @ PsychoTR0N The citizens always do that. There are parliaments for this, free press + now the network"
@Dave_Kay They should all be answered.
@ PsychoTR0N Just enter &quot;Copyright&quot; as a search term on Twitter. I cannot send links yet.
Initiative &quot;Fair Copyright Law&quot; of members CDU / CSU is a great example of successful initiative on the Internet.
@tomaschek Danke
@tirsales @pc_org @rka @Schmidtlepp Great. Agreed. The people at @pc_org should make an appointment with us.
@levudev What should it look like and who should occupy it?
@levudev The public prosecutor always investigates. The police are always only an auxiliary body (but of course not those specifically affected).
@levudev I get it: But it&#39;s about the difference between checking and determining. Investigation is only possible if there is concrete suspicion.
@Cyrus_McDugan I see exactly the same. Therefore my offer.
@levudev We already have that in data protection: Security authorities have to log activities so that an occasional check is possible
@Schmidtlepp No sensible person has ever asked for preventive monitoring of potential burglars. So what&#39;s the point?
@Schmidtlepp At the level we do not discuss here. &quot;Turn the word in the mouth&quot; is not possible.
@pc_org Definitely. Also with @tirsales or @rka if @Schmidtlepp can&#39;t
"@himselforama @schmidtlepp Checking is completely ok, so I not only protected CCC but also praised it."
@Farlion Then we have to provide the federal and state data protection officers with sufficient equipment
". @ Schmidtlepp But that&#39;s an argument: As a private citizen, I also trust my fellow citizens - nevertheless my apartment was broken into!"
@Farlion Good questions. Will try to get a detailed answer from BMI etc. Can&#39;t promise but do my best.
"@Dave_Kay I&#39;ve been doing it since Saturday, with BTag responsible for the federal and state parliament for the federal states. Will debate in the Bundestag on the overall question."
@vertigonix That is currently being checked and there must be no Persil notes in advance after prejudices.
@Schmidtlepp Such measures are only permitted in exceptional cases under the strictest conditions. It&#39;s about whether they were complied with here
@jfkorn But we have to bring exactly the two sides together. They have to learn from each other.
@Schmidtlepp Then mans can also leave what many want. But today B. Hirsch supported the BMI&#39;s demand for law.
"@DVaulont Consider including judges as a good idea, as with other measures. But not enough on its own."
"@Farlion If software is checked publicly, it is dead. Therefore, they need a reliable legal and technical check that guarantees GG conformity"
". @ DVaulont Parliament to deal intensively. Problem: MdB often lacks technical knowledge, judges also often. Technicians often are not lawyers."
"TÜV for Trojans is interesting, but not yet mature. Need position that can judge technical + legal side equally well."
@ PsychoTR0N It is always secret for those affected. But in the network age everything comes out (almost). Control works.
@SusanneButz This is what is so exciting about Twitter: You often know people even though you have never seen them.
1. Legally or not? 2. If not: Who was involved? 3. Consequences for the future (Probl: Who should check whether GG requirements are met?)
Now we know pretty well which federal state has used Trojans and how often. Went fast. Clarify now: (Follows 2)
@cdubasis This is the SPD method to punish the federal electoral losers: they have to spoon out the soup at the federal level.
@presroi Didn&#39;t get the blacky completely after 2 years. Is Android better or just trendy?
"@ 2n1f @ 50hz @Volker_Beck @ThomasOppermann Not so quickly: Act.hours is &quot;currently&quot; agreed, so Mo is the meeting location. Tweet follows"
@Volker_Beck @ 50hz @ThomasOppermann That&#39;s right. The majority PGF has not yet spoken. But it&#39;s great that @ThomasOppermann is back too
@tj_tweets Then greet them from the &quot;old&quot; THW State Secretary @peteraltmaier
@cducsu At least. But Luxembourg + Switzerland would also have trembled before him. (But also do all SPD voters)
@Valandir I am not a friend of the banks. But need a working structure. Am for bank levy (already law) + transaction tax.
@awillburger The last hope of all euro skeptics.
"@MTaege @deppentoeter @Schmidtlepp @pettre @Volker_Beck However, if you are Flemish, I naturally expect your answer in Flemish!"
"@cducsu So far, SPD has not had any success with Steinbrück: NRW 2005 was lost, BTW 2009, despite Switzerland etc., was not used."
"@awillburger That&#39;s the highlight: If everyone can use their comparative advantage, everyone has more. Ricardo already knew. Euro helps"
"@Valandir no, unfortunately not. Politicians read a lot and watch little TV. So texting, email and twitter good, everything else difficult."
@dorsalis Do you think my interns are so stupid? You also don&#39;t have to read my tweets! :-)
@Valandir But should it be like Lehman Brothers? Nobody has an answer to that yet.

"@AndreasSchepers @Volker_Beck I&#39;m pretty new, but Twitter changes a lot. Va in external communication. Above all see light sides"
"@Schmidtlepp @Volker_Beck Politics is basically a struggle for the right position. But you also have to do something together: EU + M rights, for example"
"@torschtl @Volker_Beck Of course not, but it is particularly trendy + therefore very vivid"
. @ Stefan51278 It is also a learning process to meet the requirements of the network age. :-)
. @ MTaege What administrative assistance was given when and by whom will be clarified. Everything should be on the table that requires legality
. @ skglas The discussion has just started + is far from over. Will be really lively.
GG + BVG must be strictly observed - also + especially by security authorities. Any doubt must be cleared up. Thanks again to CCC!
Good thing that BMI (yesterday) and Bayern reacted quickly. But many questions are still open. Please clarify quickly &amp; understandably. (Follows 3)

"@Volker_Beck Unfortunately, public interest is currently limited. But maybe we can change that."
"@ 2n1f On Twitter, the council of elders would probably be much shorter! And if you scored a goal, everyone would see it!"
@Volker_Beck Yes. Human rights also have something to do with the economy. See China. It&#39;s a shame that this was neglected when i-phone was introduced
@Volker_Beck @deppentoeter @vertigonix With Manchester cape. we stood at the abyss. With Lötsch communism we would be a big step ahead
"@michl_mueller Thank you, give me a lot of effort, but it doesn&#39;t always work because in between ..."
@Valandir :-))
@deppentoeter You are wrong: The Left Party is not selling itself but us (the people) and then also bad
"@vertigonix @michl_mueller @deppentoeter I am very much for freedom of expression, but you do not expect an answer to every single tweet now ??!"
@SvenVolmering Congratulations! This shows that J&#39;U-NRW is on the right track!
@michl_mueller Citizens&#39; rights have grown enormously through limitless EU + Internet. Restriction only if absolutely required + GG compliant
@Volker_Beck The Left Party is lagging 40 years behind!
@Volker_Beck You always find that in principle :-). But as I said: we can talk about everything reasonably.
@Valandir So far I haven&#39;t said a bad word against CCC: on the contrary! But the CCC doesn&#39;t say it was the federal government or the BKA.
". @ michl_mueller I have respect for citizens, don&#39;t be afraid. But courts, laws + police exist in every constitutional state - for about 2300 years."
"@Volker_Beck Let&#39;s see if you are still interested next wohe. In principle, as you know, I am always cooperative."
@vertigonix @ Stefan51278 We are not talking about federal trojans - we are talking about national trojans. Unobtrusive is ok as long as it is legal. :-)
"@Volker_Beck As I said, administrative assistance needs to be clarified. I am sure that the BMF is getting smart."
"@tirsales Oh, then Spiegel-online incorrectly quoted the pirate boss - because it was incomplete."
@schreyegg @heise_topnews You can see: I&#39;m netz-age is being clarified point by point + quickly known. Therefore: openness is best.
@hellertaler BMI explanation runs through agencies: e.g. dpa 16.45 #Ozapftis
"BMI seems credible to me, especially since CCC has not even said that it is &quot;federal&quot; Trojans"
BMI quickly declared itself publicly and clearly: No federal Trojan. Gottlob. Now countries have to explain.
"@hauk_cdu Well then: duck well, all well!"
"@CaeVye That would be a great idea. Incidentally, the process shows that public control also works here."
@mgzie Always hold me back with conclusions. I already have horses ... See
"@KlarerVerstand I&#39;m out of pirate age. But as a CDU man, I want everyone to comply with GG + laws. Also from the state"
"@Valandir yes, it would be scandalous, but the question would be who has responsibility."
"@MichaelJaegerTV No speculation. But because I am for internal security, I also want compliance with the GG"
"@skglas Agree, the only question is whether and who used programs"
@ mopsi62 I think the matter is serious. But we have to know the facts. CCC has helped a lot
@yrthy Already happens in response to @asp_net
@Raider_MXD Yes. Examination must be comprehensive
"@yrthy On whose behalf that was, you will see"
"@sven_kindler In the Reichstag, clapping due to our good politics is also very important :-). When you got out of the A, you probably clapped too"
"@Farlion Hope for the next working day, ie tomorrow"
"@svnee @hauk_cdu I really appreciate the Hauck, but the account is kind of weird. The real one would definitely have more followers"
@presroi So that with the Hauck account strikes me as Spanish
@Cyrus_McDugan It is very clear that the source TKü must be technically ensured that no misuse is possible
@JoernPL @hauk_cdu #cdu #ozapftis Funny it is not feasible. Will investigate the Hauck matter
@ Demon81 I think you can clarify who may be responsible. This is how democracy + the rule of law works.
"@Valandir If it were actually a State Trojan, it would be bad, see case law. But whether that is the case has to be clarified."
@asp_net It is not. Scherzkeks referred to a false claim that I want to give authorities time until Saturday
"Trojans: There was probably a &quot;prank cookie&quot; at work: authorities have to express themselves quickly, hope that they will be ready tomorrow."
"If it&#39;s a country trojan, it would be scandalous. Not so with purely private providers. So od so: Clarity is needed. But fix."
"# 0zapftis: Is it really &quot;federal&quot; Trojans or something external? If so, it would be bad. BMI + BKA please clear text quickly! Compliments to CCC: Good job!"

@jensbest Every visit to Twitter is a little rendez-vouz with the world. (At least a part)
"@Schmidtlepp Unfortunately there are more wrong quotes in politics than healthy. Must try to be correct, like @Schmidtlepp usually :-)"
@ switch2mac I am convinced that we will get the answers.
"@tirsales I&#39;m interested in: Where is evidence of misconduct BKA? In any case, BMI clearly denied the use of the software."
"@vertigonix It doesn&#39;t go that fast, but it was a mature achievement of the CCC, even if it has not yet named those responsible"
"@tirsales Weil spiegel-online quotes S.Nerz, &quot;the BKA is clearly outside constitutional boundaries&quot;. So far no proof"
"Again #Trojaner: CCC was good, authorities have to clear up + quickly, but no prejudices, @tirsales was too quick"
"@tirsales logo, everything has to be cleared up, but the BMI statement is a step away"
"@karpfenpeter Both are correct: my quote + your assessment. People factually oppose it, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be so important to them"
@skglas It&#39;s just a form of self-immolation in politics. If we don&#39;t make it this time - it&#39;ll be dark
"@Cyrus_McDugan Exactly, unfortunately."
@presroi you are one to me! But I would be really happy if Greens were ready for consolidation as a sustainable policy.
@ostpirat The boss is - as most of the time - right: we have a government debt and a banking crisis
"@ Kreuzer1965 problem is only when banks go bankrupt, investors suffer ie population. If bank systemic then all of us"
@twittycmf Julia Klöckner naturally has a lot more followers and therefore more work!
@indiesemNetz @anked @hildwin @dominikrzepka @haekelschwein # maternal crochet pig feelings I&#39;m looking forward to your pig
"@ Kreuzer1965 Exactly. Unfortunately, banks have not learned much from the last crisis. Unfortunately."
"@karpfenpeter My argument was: as long as BTag cross-party for it, people will accept that."
"@weltvermesser No, the example of Deutschlkand shows that consolidation + growth is possible at the same time."
@awillburger That is why we need more banking and financial market regulation. Hope financial transaction tax comes quickly even if only eurozone
"@skglas Yes, except USA where both. That is why states have to change direction, not 100 to 0, but sustainably!"
"@world surveyor True, competitiveness is key. But whoever is in debt also loses it because he Evades decisions"
"@skglas Unfortunately, the outbidding competition is still working. Everyone likes to take gifts + Popolism comes from populair!"
"@awillburger I agree. But are there any countermeasures? Merkel, Draghi, unfortunately not obama / Berlusconi. Need support."
"Horst is right: we don&#39;t have a EURO but a DEBT crisis: in the USA, Greece, NRW + elsewhere."
"@Schmidtlepp @ hmpf22 Yes, that&#39;s right. Rumors that we had a role offer for remake of the Muppet show are greatly exaggerated :-)"
