@ achim1282 We want a minimum wage of € 8.50. Comprehensive and legal.
Minimum wage is the lower limit for decent wages. We are also #hartaberfair for strong tariff partners &amp; good deals
"While Christian Lindner speaks, watch the video &quot;Work is worth more!&quot; What we will change: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j3Mebegfdg&amp;feature=share&amp;list=SP85IMmq0WVlRCp8XnPL48GiYkAZv4Z5SZ… #hartaberfair"
For us it is clear that those who work full-time must be able to live off their wages. Therefore: minimum wage. #hard but fair
"Statutory minimum wage: guaranteed everywhere, in every industry. The lower wage limit is Swiss cheese. #hard but fair"
The difference between the minimum wage and the Union wage floor: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QE-sqJxk2o… #hartaberfair
Germany does not need many small wage floor limits that do not help anyone. We need the minimum wage that works. #hard but fair
Collective bargaining is not worth it. We protect honest companies that convince with quality. Not with wage pressures. #hard but fair
The minimum wage strengthens companies that pay good wages. Because they no longer have to compete for dumping wages. #hard but fair
The minimum wage saves around € 4 billion in tax money annually because we no longer have to raise poverty wages. #hard but fair
"Today one in four works in the low-wage sector, only 67% in normal employment. #hard but fair"
"The SPD nursing concept: 125,000 new nursing staff. So that the focus is on people. #hard but fair"

Minimum wage works. The new child benefit is even more effective: increases child benefit by up to € 140 / month up to an income of € 3000 #optionarena
Eliminate daycare fees! #wahlarena # steinbrück pic.twitter.com/Jvu9zTRK0M
Today women earn an average of 22% less than men - often doing the same job. We end that by law. #wahlarena # steinbrück
"The lower wage limit or minimum wage is not a hair splitting, but a difference: For 6.8 million. People who earn less than 8.50 # Wahlarena"

"@aflasbar If you have paid 45 years, you CANNOT have to retire at 63 years."
Anyone who has worked for 45 years can retire at 63. Without deductions. No ifs and buts. #hard but fair
Good pensions need fair wages. That&#39;s where we start. Immediate measure against poverty in old age: Solidarity pension € 850 with the SPD. #hard but fair
". @ abloescher @TSmithRV Nice that you have regional, economic and family opportunities. Many don&#39;t have it. #hard but fair"

. @ florianmerker Business models that work through the exploitation of people must not be subsidized by increasing.
The minimum wage immediately improves income from 32% in East Germany and 17% in West Germany. #hard but fair
Support for families. The new child benefit helps family with low income. CDU wants politics only for high earners. #hard but fair
