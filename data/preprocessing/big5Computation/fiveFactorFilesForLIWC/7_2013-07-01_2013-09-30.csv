"@PNothwang now? Union strong 42% - but Merkel without chancellor majority, or did I overlook something?"
@ulimoll but not in advance!
@DirkDiedrich @Achim_Zoeller: That&#39;s right: We don&#39;t want a grand coalition! Maybe in the end we have to - but only if there is a change of policy + members - Yes!
"@jensspahn @MGrosseBroemer Mr. Spahn, Ms. Merkel has 42%, FDP is outside - black and yellow without a majority = change of policy. Basic arithmetic!"
"Wolfgang Bok (!) In SHZ warns of populist polemics, praises the Union &amp; FDP &amp; AFD majority, criticizes the left-wing press. What pills do that?"
Wolfgang Bok (!) In SHZ on Sunday warns of populist polemics praises majority of Union &amp; FDP &amp; AFD
Today we are going back to SH - but the next few days are also tough. A lot of discussion about the right way is necessary!
"Besides, one does not have to try to verify bad political clich√©s by one&#39;s own bad example. Trouble reading morning!"

"@ 2n1f Is not in 140 characters substance with good work, fair social and tax policy, modern family policy, social Europe."
Government participation only if there is a change of policy and the consent of our members - I am committed to this.

Polling stations still open for 3 hours. Vote! Abstention from voting is totally uncool and stupid. Democratic duty instead of zero buck!
Was an election campaign with ups and downs - really stupid I found only occasional glorification of the non-voters!
Have seen a lot of great involvement with SPD election workers in the last few weeks - I hope very much that this will be rewarded by voters!

Black and yellow people on the timeline whine because they quote Bouffier and take it seriously. But wood against the SPD with a red sock campaign!
"CDU &amp; FDP poster against alleged red-green danger, although SPD has ruled out the crystal-clear - Bouffier wants to be ashamed of AFD!"
@c_vogt Did you hear your Hessian coalition partner Bouffier? Didn&#39;t your partrei coalition with the crook Schill in Hamburg?
"Typical Hessen-Union: in case of doubt on the right Who should trust Merkel &amp; R√∂sler &amp; Seehofer-Bouffier is not just anyone, but CDU federal vice!"
Not at all! ‚Äú@ SteffiLemke: Why should one believe the federal CDU that they mean AfD exclusion if CDU Bouffier is committed to them?‚Äù
"If you want a stable and social Europe, you can&#39;t trust Merkel &amp; R√∂sler &amp; Seehofer &amp; Lucke (AFD) coalition! No vote for black and yellow!"
The black and yellow campaign against alleged red-green plans of the SPD von Bouffier exposed as hypocrisy: AFD coalition option for CDU
"Bouffier is chatting away: Union plans coalition with right-wing populist AFD: yesterday Schill in Hamburg, today AFD danger for Germany!"
Merkel is playing around with the AFD topic like with all other topics - Bouffier says (accidentally?) What really matters: Maintaining power even with AFD!
"CDU + FDP argue violently over second votes as if they belonged to them, not voters. Best solution: Neither CDU nor FDP but SPD, or red-green!"

Anyone who heard R√∂sler&#39;s speech tonight knows that it will end in black and yellow the next Sunday!
Dobrindt and D√∂ring appear very fussy in the Berlin group - confidence for black and yellow election victory in the federal government looks different!
@c_vogt not only - but you want black and yellow in the waistband! Don&#39;t be so self-envious of criticism! R√∂sler&#39;s appearance was self-explanatory!
Now there has to be a committed fight for the red-green policy change! 13 times CDU &amp; FDP could not form a common government-bet also on September 22nd!

"Only and only if voters decide differently than one would like to ask, whether and how electoral goals can still be achieved."

@c_lindner the only real threat to Germany would be a majority for the black and yellow alliance of conservatives &amp; egoists!
Ms. Merkel does not have to apologize - she must be voted out together with her reliably inactive black and yellow chaos combo!

"Incidentally, state and federal policy is about resolute fight against tax crime - we like to argue with Kubicki &amp; Co."

The topic really has nothing to do with state politics (tax secrecy violation) is also punishable. Little expertise in debate.
How the FDP intends to turn it into a state parliament investigation committee is a mystery. fudge
I am amazed at some things about &quot;Kieler Steuerfall&quot;. Local government supervision of the state reviews procedures + decision of the Kiel OB. That&#39;s just the point!

Events in Barmstedt and Rellingen with a good discussion about policy change. Red-green progress + justice instead of black and yellow!
ARD daily topics - smartphones spied on. NSA has extensive access - 8.9.2013 for Mr. Grosse-Br√∂mer http://youtu.be/xePXj98fHNs
@ Doppelgeist60 Walking in the Social Media wonderland
@MGrosseBroemer well how? By deselecting the catastrophically bad black and yellow predecessor government in NRW - like wherever there are elections!
"@SaschaGudat - check the timeline, still daily; -}"
"You grab your head: CDU babbles about privatization of the channel! Ideologically, from yesterday, hostile to workers, luckily opposition!"
Unions have shown a sense of responsibility at the Kiel Canal - now the federal government has a duty to ensure safe and well-paid work!
"Neither surveys, nor demos or commentators, not even backroom politics decide, but citizens and only on September 22nd!"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Yesterday election campaign in L√ºbeck and the interesting Willy Brandt play in the L√ºbeck theater. Today to NRW.
"Interesting, moving, torn premiere of the Willy Brandt play in the L√ºbeck theater. Stimulating and strong as an actor!"
"And everything was not good, both of course had to mean that, you noticed, right? ; -} üòÄ"
Kubicki quotes Steinbr√ºck: &quot;Less of more can be more than more of less.&quot; That&#39;s right: less FDP is better than more CDU and both are good!
Off to the panel discussion at Haus &amp; Grund in Hall 400 in Kiel. Rather away game - but sports spirit is good! üòÄ

Then later to L√ºbeck. With colleague Gabi Hiller-Ohm signature campaign against tax criminals and theater premiere &quot;Willy Brandt&quot; piece.
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Full day ahead with Kiel office appointments, discussion of housing policy with Bundestag candidates."
"@GEBERMOS Did you think so, what? But no: people&#39;s voice in real!"
"Quote: &quot;The Merkel is still going, but the yellow ones are unelectable for decades ...&quot; Just heard in the ICE dining car ...."
ICE Hannover-Hamburg. Dining car. Snatches of conversation. A few people apparently know that federal elections are. Obviously no FDP fans here.
Return via Kassel to Hamburg. Change mood in Hesse very tangible. TSG makes super election campaign. Red green in federal and state would be the best!
Election campaign with R√ºdiger Veit and Kurt Beck in downtown Gie√üen. Great mood in summer weather. Strong SPD women with mayor and district administrator.
@c_vogt my shyness is known nationwide; -}
@ohlix election campaigns only exist in democracies. And &quot;hard but fair&quot; is better than the consensus sauce that some &quot;monarchists&quot; love so much.

"My music tip for you today is a bit ironic, but very appropriate: Tim Bendzko- &quot;Programmed&quot;. http://youtu.be/G7nrO8MJvaE"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today I go to Hessen for campaign campaigns. The policy change is announced there!
Sigmar Gabriel with convincing argumentation on tax policy in #wiegehts at MariettavSlomka on ZDF.
Very interesting report by Marietta Slomka on ZDF: &quot;How is Germany doing?&quot;; many should look at that!
@tsghessen Unfortunately I can not - but support that and do such action in SH! Good luck!
With me there is no car toll (Merkel) - without a car toll I do not sign a coalition agreement (Seehofer). Change of government!

@c_vogt admit that you belong to the intelligent Free Democrats - but it doesn&#39;t go that far; -}

"Merkel talks around and wants to protect Hoene√ü &amp; Konsorten, Peer is clear in the fight against tax criminals #tvduell"
Are you crazy? ‚Äú@Peteraltmaier: Steinbr√ºck effortlessly drives both the Left Party and the AFD voters in #TVDuell! :-( &quot;
Merkel works defensively when asked specifically and cannot just ramble around and rumble. #tvduell # movement now
Only Peer Steinbr√ºck also offers a clear edge on European issues. #tvduell
Madams are reluctant to ask questions. #tvduell
"Our country is not bad, Ms. Merkel, but your government! #tvduell"
Merkel for poverty wages - that&#39;s clear! #tvduell
"Angela Merkel justifies her policies for those up there, with zero sympathy for the situation of the low wages. #tvduell"
The first question from bobbin to Merkel is strange!
Steinbr√ºck: We need a government that is run and does not drive in a roundabout. A good start! #tvduell
"When it comes to content, it looks good for the red-green alliance for progress and justice. #tvduell # movement now"
Today there is a direct comparison between the Chancellor and the challenger. #tvduell # movement now
I am curious to see whether only chic labels are being looked at today or a look into the empty black and yellow bottles! #tvduell
@turbozopf rather your cynicism. Democracy calls for active participation not only derogatory comments!
The so-called Christian-liberal coalition advocates poverty wages for more than 7 million people! #tvduell # movement now
I wonder if Ms Merkel will come up with her own opinion or offer SPD plagiarism using the Guttenberg method. #tvduell
Finally: election campaigns only exist in democracies. Competition for a better future for our country. Germany must be fairer! #tvduell
Nobody claim that the election has already been made. Choose plain text against Merkelei today and then change politics! #tvduell # movement now
"Steinbr√ºck speaks plainly: good neighborhood in Europe, more investment in education + infrastructure, dual citizenship #tvduell"
"Today Merkel can no longer resist election campaigns, and our country has to be fairer: minimum wages, a rent brake, decent pensions. #tvduell"
Work victory for Holstein Kiel 2-1 against Burghausen. These are the games you have to win!
@_drsarkozy This variant the other Bangb√ºxen rejected; -}
Who insists that women should not continue to receive the same wages as men? Who wants Flexiquatsch instead of Quote? Bingo! Merkel &amp; Co!
"Who defends starvation wages, finds the tax subsidy for low wages great and fights nationwide minimum wages? Bingo! Merkel &amp; Co"
Who is in favor of the multi-billion day nursery premium and the anti-social head allowance for health and care? Bingo! Merkel &amp; Co! #tvduell
"On land black and yellow stands for radioactive danger, on water for shallows and otherwise for everything that Germany does not need. #tvduell"
A black and yellow extension has already been added to the notched wood. Bet that the electorate will not allow a second black and yellow term extension!
Tonight: Market-compliant democracy (Angela Merkel) against democratic-compliant markets (Peer Steinbr√ºck)! #tvduell
Who is leading the world&#39;s largest non-governmental organization? Bingo! The Merkel! #tvduell
Who is for and against everything? Who does what has just been excluded? Who believes in wind direction? Bingo! The Merkel! #tvduell
"Good tradition for 2 years: Nowhere black and yellow gets a majority, everywhere they are voted out - NRW, SH, NDS, BaW√º, HH, RP ... # tvduell"

"Tonight red &quot;We decide&quot; against black and yellow &quot;If everyone thinks of themselves, everyone is thought&quot;! #tvduell"
Tonight red-green politics for the common good against the black and yellow political motto: &quot;A lot for a few and a little for many&quot;! #tvduell
"Tonight the red original against the black plagiarism (minimum wage, Guttenberg, rent brake, Schavan, energy transition ...) #TVDuell"
Tonight red power drink (multivitamin juice) against muckefuck (black &amp; weak). Germany can be governed better! #TVDuell

Right in Wiesbaden. Election campaign in Hessen for the change of politics!
@DoroBaer @tazgezwitscher what a pity; -}
Merkel reveals good-natured speeches in European debates as stupid chatter. Attack on SPD shows: For them comes party and then the country!
Did K√∂hler + Wulff actually give up annoyed because Ms. Merkel wanted to be the real president? She is not the head of government.
We do have a Federal President - although she is the third among Merkel&#39;s personnel selection directors - Merkel is not the Chancellor.
Smile and do nothing - Soothing good-night speeches and sitting out - lulling and not teasing leadership - all that is Merkel!

Good closing speech from Peer Steinbr√ºck! Choose policy change! #tvduell # movement now
Peer Steinbr√ºck was the better tonight in every way! #tvduell # movement now
Coalition debate also goes clearly to Peer Steinbr√ºck. #tvduell # movement now
"Merkel takes sentences twice as long, but says nothing. She senses + is annoyed. Steinbr√ºck argues competently + passionately #tvduell"
"Even in Syria, Ms. Merkel is less clear than Peer Steinbr√ºck. #tvduell"
Ms. Merkel is breaking new ground again - the Internet and in public. Brave mom! #tvduell # movement now
Ms. Merkel is not used to answering questions - you can tell! #tvduell
Merkel only thinks - then she doesn&#39;t act well - that we have experienced this! #tvduell
Peer Steinbr√ºck clearly on equality and childcare - Merkel is chatting here too. #tvduell
Mommy constantly says what everyone deserves or what we should do - she doesn&#39;t explain why she didn&#39;t do anything. #tvduell
Ms. Merkel is proud of her politics - why aren&#39;t nurses that? #tvduell
Black and yellow is messing with the energy turnaround - Merkel cannot ignore that. #tvduell

Because of some questions about my extra music tip for K. The forecast applies regardless of whether the FDP becomes parliamentary opp. Or APO.
The HSV should show points at Hertha today and really show it to all critics. Fans expect #despite reaction
I am amazed at how many people in the media can use remote diagnosis to decide on the matter of fact by the Mayor of Kiel without knowing the facts.

"Since FDP Kubicki blasphemes about sozis + as a provincial statue of liberty, my extra music tip poses for his future in Berlin: http://youtu.be/MNqqs4h4M7c"
You take seriously what people say publicly - Mr. H√∂ness in this case - and then the blacks howl about alleged defamation.
Criticism of JUSO poster with Merkel &amp; Hoene√ü overlooks the fact that H√∂ness CDU tax evaders preferential deal with Switzerland explicitly wanted to wait.
"@groehe @peersteinbrueck @tsghessen At the same time as the CDU rally with Ms. Merkel in SH, the CDU parliamentary group fled to Poland despite - because of?"

"It&#39;s a shame - if Silvio has anything to do with the tax, he lets it down personally. That doesn&#39;t work here."
@_drsarkozy who can do that; -}
@andreas_clever there you are right - right: tax law? &quot;Mia san mia.&quot;
@Typo_Graefin @tweetfluesterer unheard of; -}
"Trouble with the tax authorities? K will fight for you - if you can afford it - something is always possible. &quot;Me san me, dog samma scho&quot;."
"@PeterMaHe I thought he would have shown himself when the Swiss tax evasion favor deal failed, right ?!"
It seems to me that Klaus Staeck and JUSO-Aktion feel the Schickeria and the money nobility are really threatened.
Strange morality: punish young people for misconduct and demand probation for those who bring millions to Switzerland untaxed!
"FDP-Kubicki sharply criticizes Juso action. As always, he is on the side of the &quot;top performers&quot; H√∂ness &amp; Co., the difference between red-green and black-yellow is clear!"
"Juso campaign remembers: Uli Hoene√ü wanted black and yellow tax evaders&#39; preferential deal with Switzerland, but red-green prevented it."
Kumbartzky speaks - what a mishap - at FDP only liquor helps. Is Kumbartky on the bridge-crack - the bridge breaks into pieces.
@DerBruesseler why it doesn&#39;t surprise me now; -}
Happy Thursday to you all!
@danielakolbe Happy morning greeting to Lindenau; -}
The malicious comment from the right (Ulf Poschardt in the WORLD) is recommended for reading to all those who question the good SPD tax concept!

Nice event in Hamburg City Hall to celebrate 150 years of SPD in Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg. Common roots and common future!

Today reception in the guest house of the state government on the 70th birthday of Heide Simonis. Great woman who has done a lot for our country!
@ ge12345ge @GescheJoost Do one without leaving the other!
"For Pofalla, the NSA issue is done. Well fine! Any questions? Pofalla gives his word of honor that secret services comply with all laws ..; -"
"The Merkel government is uncomfortable with the difference, preferring to defame the SPD and deny its own political responsibility."
Steinmeier: Ordinary + legal cooperation of the secret services in counter-terrorism - Pofalla: NSA scandal wg. Bulk data spying.
Typical cowardly Merkel troop: Frank Walter Steinmeier defamate but block statement in front of control panel. NSA = Aussp√§haff√§re Merkel scandal!
Election campaign in Lower Saxony with SPD colleague Gunnar Wegener in Oste and Wischhafen. Focus on maritime and tourism topics.
Happy new week to all of you!
"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today appointments in Wischhafen in Lower Saxony, later reception on the 70th birthday of Heide Simonis and party councilor."

"A good mood at the start of J√ºrgen Co√üe&#39;s campaign in Lengerich. Strong program, good candidate, brilliant start!"
Election campaign to win J√ºrgen Co√üe&#39;s direct mandate with the SPD in Lengerich!
"Good constituency tour with J√ºrgen Co√üe in AWO day care center Westerkappeln, the beautiful city of Tecklenburg and company visit in Lotte. Now to Lengerich."
Old recorder alliance still intact: CDU &amp; FDP &amp; Linke attack the SPD in NSA affair and distract from failure of Merkel&#39;s chaos combo.
@sls_bmj who rules Bavaria?
"Opposition in BILD style: Callsen fights for you: fishermen, hunters, farmers, lead ammunition, bridges + roads - in SH and when Angie comes - in Poland!"
"Note (l): All good things have turned black and yellow (minimum wages, nuclear phase-out), things that are going badly (NSA, drones) are up to the SPD. Felix Germania!"
Union likes to steal good SPD apples (minimum wage variety) but compares rotten 2013 NSA pears with 2001 apples - in the end voters have the fruit salad!
@DerBruesseler maybe that&#39;s because of your glasses!
"CDU argument: 2001 apples = 2013 pears, yes, of course - both are fruits! But pears were rotten and are not apples at all. Apples are pear-basta!"
"By Adam &amp; Eva; -} ‚Äú@ DerBruesseler: @Ralf_Stegner Since total surveillance is a direct result of cooperation after 2001, your statement is nonsense.‚Äù"
The contributions of the brave black and yellow NSA warriors this morning are strongly reminiscent of &quot;news from the institution&quot;.
"I forgot that the Internet is new territory for Mrs. Merkel - so agree, the failure of Merkel&#39;s chaos combo is to blame!"
@JohnSturges @UlrichKelber @peteraltmaier yes - and the earth is a pane. Already clear: Merkel government is the nozzle. Competence or lie ?!
"@peteraltmaier @ThomasOppermann Your worries are certainly not the pirates, but a nice try. ; -}"
"The Merkel government is cowardly, and Friedrich + Pofalla&#39;s behavior is ramshackle; Kauder + Altmeier&#39;s statements about NSA sound more like a student union."
Concrete cooperation after the 2001 attack - comprehensive surveillance software 2013 illegal - apples and pears are compared!
@kleinkram happy summer greeting from the north; -}
@RasmusAndresen @ms_pieper it was about what you can do if billions of dollars in tax crime has been effectively tackled - afterwards!

@Typo_Graefin solidarity from northern Germany and happy in the working day!
"So: ask less who will do what after 22.9. or who is to blame for possible defeat, but fight red-green policy changes! Basta!"

Press work opposition (2): Pension saver Garg + A.Klahn pretty cheeky that FDP was only allowed to rule for 2 1/2 years in 25 years.
Press work of the opposition today? Alarmistic CDU tracts by Ms. Nicolaisen and Mr. Callsen on phenomenal &quot;H√∂rnumer explanation&quot; -what?
CDU colleague Nicolaisen&#39;s criticism of delusion of persecution and conspiracy theories on the report on municipal financial equalization.
"@ Bass86 15 countries for that, only voted out Carstensen &amp; Kubicki SH coalition against - you are obviously a passionate ghost driver-long life!"
It shows once again in politics: Who can not fight thinking (lack of intellectual capacity ?!) fights the thinker.
@stuebetour the subject also means pedagogy - that includes education! Those who have no concepts criticize terms!
"It is a bad habit in SH to call everything that does not fit politically a botch, applies to opposition rhetoric + would-be politicians."
Pedagogy = education + education is also in the justification of the draft school law. Tip to professional outrage from CDU &amp; FDP + others: reading educates + educates!
Pseudo-politics in word-stealing debate about terms in the school law. Everyone knows: Education + education remain part of school education!
"An ordinary collective agreement for employees on the canal is their right! For this, CDU &amp; FDP should put pressure on Ramsauer."

Kubicki says Snowden is a criminal and should return to the United States. Against anti-Americanism- Kubicki&#39;s suggestion: bullshit!

"@DerBruesseler necessary cooperation has always existed (yes, also with SPD) - but the topic today is illegal mass spying at Merkel &amp; Co."
@DerBruesseler @ spd_stefan @ EbbeSand is gradually becoming a fixed idea for you. Collaboration between the secret services yes - mass spying out no
@ ge12345ge oh and then 8 years of experience nothing - the poorest? You can tell your grandmother that!
@ ge12345ge That&#39;s right: Secret services have been around for 100 years - but it&#39;s about 8 years of political responsibility for Chancellor Angela Merkel
@ ge12345ge just a reminder: we don&#39;t have 2005 in 2013!
