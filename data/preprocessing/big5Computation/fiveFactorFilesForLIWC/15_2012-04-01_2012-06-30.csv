What exactly do you find in the argument “idiotic” @roterochs
“That wrong reporting on the backs of our children u. Fighting families is annoying u. terrifying ”@DoroBaer #faz
"“Not politicians, scientists, etc. Employer representatives decide what is good f. Is children, but only the parents ”@DoroBaer"
“#Care allowance right because d. supposedly strongest counter-arguments the weakest us. Meet society the most ”@DoroBaer #faz
"“Fathers mostly excluded from the discussion, which indicates an outdated understanding of the family d. # Childcare allowance - opponent closes ”@DoroBaer"
"“It&#39;s not a maternity allowance, otherwise we would have called it that.” @DoroBaer #faz # childcare allowance"
Deputy General Secretary @DoroBaer writes in #faz today. why the #intention money remains correct. We present you some quotes.
"Don&#39;t forget, dear Munichers: Bavaria is counting on you on Sunday: YES for the 3rd runway! http://bit.ly/OIOQcc"
