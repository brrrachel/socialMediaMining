"We owe Helmut Kohl an infinite amount: for our freedom, for our unity, for our Europe!"
"On the contrary, it shows that we take the issue seriously and struggle with ourselves - with different results"
So far worthy debate in the Bundestag with good speeches and respect for both sides. It is a shame that @kahrs in sound / content is a blatant exception.
"Congratulations, dear @ArminLaschet, for choosing MP from NRW! You will be a great Prime Minister!"
"Yes, but it was a long time ago: # red-green"
@schneidercar @MartinSchulz What did he say?
"Yes, Alex Möller!"
:-)
". @ fneuhann Unfortunately both of them are dead, and Karl Schiller had left as a minister in protest against &quot;his&quot; comrades and left the SPD!"
Congratulations @saarland_de! At that time I signed the agreement with France as BMI State Secretary in Paris! Great success story!
:-))
"Great, then you will finally see how well the government is governed! :-)"
BReg has applied for the seat of EBA UND EMA in Germany and is fighting for both agencies! Other messages are wrong.
French President Macron has said it in similar words.
"It was very nice with you! Great people, in the middle of life!"
Europe!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
But just &quot;almost&quot;! :-)
Good for everyone: Consumer climate index at the highest level for over 15 years! Private consumption rises sharply! #Germany not bad talk!
Whoever kills children kills humanity and the future! IS&#39;s commitment to the Manchester attack cannot be beaten in terms of nefariousness.
But only &quot;almost&quot;! :-) The famous little difference!
"Dear @KathrinBrandt, thank you very much! I am very pleased that I was again nominated as a candidate for the Bundestag with 98.7%!"
"Thanks for that. And as Democrats, we always have a shared responsibility, no matter who is governing."
I admit the little mistake. The big mistake was none! :-)
That&#39;s the way it is! https://twitter.com/ard_bab/status/863806568382509056…
Really? As a liberal one should choose @ArminLaschet! # Change in NRW
Decisive for the future of NRW is tomorrow who will be the strongest faction: @CDUNRW_de or SPD. Therefore every vote for @ArminLaschet!
"@kahrs Well, you are threatening tax increases every time, which we will stop every time! :-)"
Spring in NRW! https://twitter.com/zdfheute/status/862766415912337408…
Where @ kaiDiekmann is right ... https://twitter.com/kaidiekmann/status/861335580923265025…
Long live France! Long live Europe! Strong signal for our common values and Franco-German! Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron! Good presidency!
"Beautiful weather in Schleswig-Holstein! Some went swimming! Congratulations to Daniel Günther! Good night to Bordesholm, @Ralf_Stegner!"
I am happy to accept! Good sporting success! It was nice to meet you at Terminal C!
"And if you are at home in Siersburg again at the weekend: email in time, maybe enough for petit café."
Thank you!
"Dear @cdu_saar, Thank you for my election to number 1 on the CDU state list for the Bundestag election with 97.8% of the vote! I was very happy!"
You cannot deduce that from my answer. I fined that questions of faith are highly personal.
I am a Catholic and was an altar boy and editor! :-)
"Do we want to campaign or save the climate? All over the world, people are hoping for Germany - with good reason!"
"It&#39;s not a &quot;wing&quot;, it&#39;s just a few. I think what they say is wrong and it has nothing to do with the position of the CDU."
What does this have to do with climate protection?
Thank you Mr. President! Your word has inspired the world. Climate is the mission of our generation! https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron/status/870407981044834304…
The Paris Climate Agreement has united the world - to the sake of the planet and all of us. It will survive and succeed! Let's fight for it!
Congratulation and jubilation !!! https://twitter.com/florianeder/status/826693902430326785 …
Can&#39;t you say the right thing in the beer tent? Chancellor has represented our interests well at NATO / G7. @ThomasOppermann @sigmargabriel
And so with you? # Steinbrück
"If Luther hadn&#39;t existed, he would have had to be invented! I say that as a Catholic!"
It&#39;s all mixed up! The voters feel that!
"Oh, was that you? :-) Compliments for your France tweets!"
"Great: unemployment rate fell sharply again in April! Halved red-green from 5.3 million to 2.6 million since the end! 175,000 less than 4/16!"
"Happy Easter! Even though a lot is sad this year: #Syria, #Giftgas, #North Korea, #IS, #AlKaida, #London, #SanktPetersburg, #BVB"
"Congratulations, dear @ArminLaschet, for success in the TV duel! You understand more about NRW, and governing too!"
Chancellor in the Bundestag on @Besser_Deniz: It is not justifiable if a GOVERNMENT carries out prejudices.
The roast potato ratios are known to have the best ratios! :-)
:-) happy Easter
"Where you are right ... :-) By the way, there are poached eggs at @welt! :-) https://twitter.com/ulfposh/status/853114617639383042…"
Phantomschmerzen?
Well then: congratulations !!!
Félicitation cordiale! France now has a strong president with a large majority in parliament. Good for Europe and Germany!
Thank you!
Thank you ! Good idea!!!
Thank you !!!
Thank you! :-)
Thank you! The countdown is running!
3/3 Looking forward to many exciting content debates about our ideas for Germany&#39;s future! Also on Twitter!
It was hard work with @sigmargabriel &amp; others: Global victory for green electricity is only possible if it is affordable for everyone! https://twitter.com/welt/status/852805436952662016…
Happy Easter! https://twitter.com/1vanackeren/status/852798289065811968…
I only type myself - including the typing errors!
Slightly exaggerated! https://twitter.com/jeremycliffe/status/852251592233545728 …
"Don&#39;t worry, the government program will be easy to read and understand! :-)"
"The latter, the latter! :-)"
That would of course give you the rest! :-)
Good idea! Wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing that could happen to the comrades! :-)
I&#39;ve blocked you now!
"An inhumane, cowardly deed: Whoever the perpetrators were: Thanks to the police, fans &amp; players for prudence, sense of duty &amp; courage!"
"No, is necessary for clear demarcation: Minister Gabriel also had an office in the SPD house for party tasks. My CDU role is the program."
"Dear @ThomasOppermann, since I am neither general secretary nor campaign leader, your tweet is completely devoid of purpose! :-)"
Since I am clearly NOT the campaign leader: Please do not spread any false reports!
"Just as intense as Andrea Nahles &amp; @ManuelaSchwesig &amp; Kollege @HeikoMaas, who are involved in the SPD program!"
Always remain objective: The expansion of renewable energies takes a big step forward every year in Germany Already over 1/3 when generating electricity!
I think it&#39;s great! Energy transition must also succeed elsewhere! # Climate protection https://twitter.com/auswaertigesamt/status/856504262846754816…
"Dear Tobias, you more than deserve this from your work! All the very best!"
The result for @EmmanuelMacron shows: France AND Europe can win together! The middle is stronger than the populists believe!
"@Wahlrecht_de Yes, we think so too! :-)"
Adenauer&#39;s 50th anniversary of death: Mass celebration with Cardinal Woelki - exhibition opened (via @koelnischeR) http://mobil.rundschau-online.de/26733636?dmcid=sm_tw…
The joy was completely on my side!
"Yes, but in moderation! Greetings!"
Wembley Gate: In the hospital and on the radio! Envious ?
"Thanks for the clarification, of course I did not observe my gesture myself."
Please don&#39;t quote me wrong: I said &quot;if&quot;.
That&#39;s the only thing you can really say at the moment: https://twitter.com/sigmargabriel/status/853663047021453312…
"On the contrary: I mentioned terrorist attacks from 2017, and of course BVB Dortmund was there too!"
You haven&#39;t heard me talk yet !!! :-)
"Not quite like that, in D. Looking forward to an interview in @berlindirekt today: It&#39;s great that you have time for climate protection! https://twitter.com/thomaswalde/status/848494996550557696…"
@berlindirekt @PIK_Klima I&#39;m really excited to see what he says :-) !!!
2/3 My friend @petertauber is and remains the leader of the campaign: Don&#39;t believe everything that is reported!
"1/3 I am pleased that, as a CDU liaison member, I can take responsibility for the development of our government program."
"@BILD The tweet is absolutely correct, something of!"
You are absolutely right. But from 15% to 9%: the direction is right!
"Again no majority for red-red-green. Direction is right! Distance to SPD is growing, AfD is below 10%. So it can go on! https://twitter.com/wahlrecht_de/status/850795128264503296…"
"If the AfD continues to descend, the fall in autumn is really over ..."
The Syrian poison gas attack and the terrorist attacks in St. Petersburg &amp; Stockholm: The authors must not escape!
Looks like it ....
"Our sympathy and solidarity go to all victims of the attack, St. Petersburg and Russia. There is no justification for terror!"
What is declining is the amount of returns. Today PV is made on open spaces for less than 7 cents.
why are they lost? The expansion of renewable energy is making great strides: well over 30% for electricity!
Just ask the red-green state government in NRW ... :-(
"Yes, the REs are cheap, but they need reserve capacity of coal and gas when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing."
No new coal-fired power plants are built.
"Not at all, I want to prevent that. But even if we went to zero CO2 in Germany, others have to join in to make it happen"
Climate protection is extremely important. But only if we preserve the environment AND prosperity will other countries follow us! https://twitter.com/berlindirekt/status/848595184216670209…
"Even barely done, done! Do we want to advance climate protection together? A. Merkel stands for climate protection worldwide!"
