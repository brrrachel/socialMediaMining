Nazis out is currently just consensus. I like to be there too. But could we not dispose of the other socialists at the same time?

Sometimes it doesn&#39;t matter who benefits as long as you are at peace with yourself. Merz no longer owes the CDU. So why stress?

It was taking longer than she thought. She thinks so. And the end is also easily foreseeable. People always think linear and never in processes. This leads to misjudgments. ;-)

Do colleagues (including extremists) have to protect their identity? The corps spirit among journalists is part of the problem. Veronika Kracher&#39;s name is Lady!

Twitter is a dark place.
"Absolutely not. Since I know that, I take it very seriously. That is also not my criticism of the Tagesschau."
"The context was overwhelming, just different from what was intended."
"No, there are dishes for that. But false reports from the Tagesschau do not justify it."
The shit storm at the √ñR-Trulla shows the opposite.
"Yes, it is just completely out of place here because the √ñR acts exactly the same way. By the way, the Tagesschau does the same here."
"The Shitstorm actually came about because she thought that anyone who didn&#39;t choose The Greens was a Nazi. But little things like that can slip through, Mr. Relotius."
