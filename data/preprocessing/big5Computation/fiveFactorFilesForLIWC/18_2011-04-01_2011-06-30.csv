To the ceremony of 20 years of the Thuringian police and then to the summer party of LKA and BePo - but does that also take place when it rains?
The next shift to the right in the German Fraternity: http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/34/34997/1.html…
"After the chief of police, the head of the LKA has to go. Legal consequences still remain necessary."
@lorz congratulations !!!!
"Racist, sexist, disgusting - that is the German fraternity"
CDUSPD offer residential areas instead of freedom of movement. Harassment on holiday vouchers and controls remain for refugees.
Sabine Berninger (LINKE) &quot;There is a majority for abolishing the residence obligation in Thuringia - but the SPD prefers to ignore its own decisions&quot;
"Heidrun Sedlacik LINKE during the consultation Petition report &quot;That it is not the one who has the power that wins, but the one with the better arguments&quot;"
"tlz headlines: &quot;Erfurt releases 100,000 euros for public pope viewing&quot;, sorry but that must mean public-pope-viewing"
I would finally like to hear political arguments from the SPD against our local right to petition - and not legal advice
Eisenach city leaders are not coming to the German Boys&#39; Day this year - what about representatives of state politics or parties?
What does Patrick Kurth (FDP) actually say about &quot;Aryan detection&quot; at DB? http://www.scribd.com/doc/25900011/Verbandsbruder-Polnische-Grenzen-fraglich…
&#39;Animal Plenum&#39;: First a breed list and then a law on &quot;animal by-products&quot;. That will be nothing today with procurement from the police
LINKE does not call for participation of democrats in the boys&#39; day in Eisenachn: http://bit.ly/iAMyBe
I just threw the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution from the list of followers - they can do a little more work
19 out of 22 listeners in the InnenA reject breed lists in the state government&#39;s draft law on &quot;dangerous animals&quot;. SPDCDU is not itchy.
Irregularities in the procurement of batons for the Thuringian police are now also on the agenda of the current interior committee
"Procurement crime at the Thuringian police: cars, helicopters, flash technology, truncheons and no end - http://bit.ly/mgHvyF"
Michaele Sojka (the left) with a view to the broken educational promises of the SPD: &quot;Amnesia is part of taking office.&quot;
Susanne Hennig (die LINKE): &quot;Education for everyone must also apply to university entrance in the master&#39;s programs&quot;
SPD rejects FDP and LEKE changes in data protection. Argument: Waiting for the government bill. In logic is &quot;nothing more than little&quot;
JU with a debt mountain bouncy castle in front of the plenary hall. Police with two tubs and a car on site. OK then. This is an attack on the mind.
Kemmerich (FDP) on the minimum wage with a Nazi slogan: &quot;Social is what creates work&quot; No wonder that right-wing populism is becoming socially acceptable
Police structural reform removed from plenary agenda. I dare to make a forecast: We won&#39;t see the law again this year.
Coalition stumbles on police reform. CDU-SPD paralyze parliament until Fiedler / Gentzel or Voss / Lieberknecht prevail.
Immediately to the commemorative event on May 8 in Gotha and then to 135 years of the Ohratalbahn
Irregularities in the Th. Ministry of the Interior are entering a new round. Anti-Corruption Policy overridden: http://bit.ly/guoioe
MdL Kemmerich (FDP) &quot;I am actually endowed with charm towards women&quot; - such a misjudgment is rare.
In plenary: Law of the LEFT to change the civil servant law. Heads of subordinate authorities need competence and not the right party book
"CDU-SPD coalition in Thuringia continues to procrastinate: amendment to the Personnel Representation Act, expert opinion on regional reform. We make legs."
Right-wing extremist &quot;Silesian Youth&quot; is finally becoming an issue in federal politics: http://bit.ly/eilsIS
"MDR has it, the opposition is asking for information, but the interior minister knows nothing about internal audit reports on police procurement."
