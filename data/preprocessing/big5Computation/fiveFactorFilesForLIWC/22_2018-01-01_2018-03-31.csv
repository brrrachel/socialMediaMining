"It is strange that the S&amp;D, ALDE, GUE / NGL, EFDD and ENF groups do not consider it necessary to be involved in this Bulgarian debate with their group leaders."
"On the Western Balkans, Borissov said: Either the EU would help the countries there or Russia, China and Saudi Arabia would. &quot;Help&quot;!? Yes, that&#39;s how it looks from the Balkans."
"In his speech, Borissov also set a Russian accent: the EU must normalize relations with Russia. He said nothing about the necessary conditions."
"Borissov said they want to send refugees to the member countries they want. Juncker emphasized that majority decisions should apply, ie that everyone should help refugees."
Borissov had not even mentioned the rule of law. Juncker says the Council President has to take care of that.
"Interesting, as Juncker twice warned President Borissov in his speech on the BLG Council Presidency: in terms of the rule of law and refugee policy."
The main topic of the beginning of the Bulgarian Council Presidency in the EU will be the perspective of the Western Balkans on EU accession.

Varadkar stresses that the EU needs to focus more on Africa. - You hear such sentences more often now. But where would the EU&#39;s Africa strategy actually result from?
Taoiseach Varadkar supports Europe-wide election lists for the EP and the top candidate model. Advocates broad EU future debates with citizens. Ireland is already doing that.
Now in the European Parliament: Ireland&#39;s Prime Minister (&quot;Taoiseach&quot;) Varadkar speaks on the future of the EU. Already in his first sentences shows more perspective than Borissov in whole speech.
"Zu Korruption sagt Borissov: ""If there was rampant corruption in Bulgaria, why would we get reelected all the time?"" Interessante Frage!"
Borissov responds to Ska Keller&#39;s criticism of # Pirin National Park: it is only about the construction of a second cable car. &quot;Otherwise I will do everything to protect this mountain.&quot;
