"#Erdogan is the president of a friendly country. I have often criticized completely different views than he and him publicly and in person. For state visits, however, the following applies: hospitality. I don&#39;t think of any exceptions. What else do we do when Trump comes?"
We have known the strategies of the right for a long time. We have to get up now and stop them! I&#39;ll clarify that with Anne Will tonight. Turns on the first one at 9:45 p.m.
The AfD uses fascist strategies. This leads to violence on the streets. We are all seeing this now - we have to get up now! pic.twitter.com/ottRNmHbnm
"Visited @LulaOficial in Curitiba prison. Brazil deserves a president who stands for social justice, respect and multilateral cooperation. This is the Workers&#39; Party project that I support! https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Schulz-ist-bei-Lula-im-Gefaengnis-article20600109.html… pic.twitter.com/3gmTzZ15YX"
The Greeks have been successful and will leave the aid programs. That is a reason for joy. But they had to make many sacrifices. I hope we have all learned that rescues must not be done at the people&#39;s expense. https://www.dw.com/de/martin-schulz-zu-viel-politik- gegen-das-griechische-volk-machen/a-45114911…
"The atomic bomb not only destroyed the cities of #Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also the lives of generations of people. With weapons today, we could destroy our own planet multiple times. My appeal: let&#39;s finally destroy the nuclear weapons."
"With the growing extremist forces, pro-European forces across Europe must pull together. If we fight each other, the others win! I just met with @EmmanuelMacron and discussed it. Many similarities."
The eyes of the children expose our world with their sometimes strange rules and their often bizarre logic. So we supposedly learn something big from the little ones. Christine Nöstlinger&#39;s books have always revealed this anew. My obituary: http://m.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/christine-noestlinger-martin-schulz-erinnert-sich-an-die-kinderbuchautorin-a-1218667.html…
"European cooperation is based on mutual respect among peoples, human dignity, tolerance and diversity. When #Trump calls such a project his opponent, it says a lot about himself."
"Christine Nöstlinger&#39;s death concerns me. It leaves wonderful books to the world and certainly many children of future generations, which encouraged and will encourage many. I always preferred to read “The Stories of Franz”. And now: cockchafer fly!"
"Germany must never become an upgraded military power like the United States. What is this armament spiral about? Our contribution to international stability is: Diplomacy, Humanitarian Aid and Development Cooperation. We have to be confident against Trump!"
"&quot;For the victory of evil, it is enough that the good do nothing,&quot; Edmund Burke told us on the way. It is high time for an uprising of decency, for a real pro-European left-wing movement. I have that today @Le_Figaro , @elpais_espana and @repubblica said."
#Orban says solidarity with Germany means building fences. I say: Solidarity with Germany always means solidarity with refugees.
"I was just in the German Resistance Memorial Center in an exhibition of the Reich banner. We no longer have to defend democracy by force, but we do have to defend it. The courage of the people of the Reichsbanner is mine and can be a role model for all of us. pic.twitter.com/f2MJRGT4vm"
