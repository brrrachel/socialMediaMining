Nothing works without music. Not even 2017. Here is my Spotify list. 10 songs that stay. https://open.spotify.com/user/lars.klingbeil/playlist/5YXeXLyn4vIOjyZ4OC1O2M?si=81utsLLaS82r-IPDDSi-2A… pic.twitter.com/6edXdBYMPH
"In terms of content, what do you think is wrong with the requirement that politics must be more open and understandable? Or that it needs to be more present and there should be more political debates? I&#39;m looking forward to your answer;)"
The @ulfposh is getting more attention these days than Santa Claus ... at least on Twitter.

I look forward to a dialogue with you! #SPDerneuern #Sondierungen @spdde pic.twitter.com/ApKbZ2PiyC
Congratulation!
Do you always say to me?
"The party congress decided that we should talk. And what should we talk about if not about content? Even with tolerance, one would have to talk about content. Or in cooperation."
I look at myself!
is not really much
😎
Earlier the @DerBayernBlog kept such evenings free ...
Thank you
Right 🤘🏻
"We clearly defined our goals in the lead application. But: we have no red lines. But goals. But in the end, PT and member vote decide."
Of course not.
that would have come in places 10-15. but we should talk anyway :)
We have not defined any red lines. But our goals.
Thank you and good cooperation!
I am with you.
I do something completely different :)
"yes, counter-speech. don&#39;t play things off against each other. getting better in structures &amp; more involvement must be possible."

At the 50th party congress there is a certificate!
But do we agree that a substantive debate without connection to personnel issues in our party is a good style?

The cake break is a little short!
Thank you :)

Exactly. This is the normal way of applying to us. Resolutions almost the party congress.
No chance :)
Wait.
Just do it!
But.
Thank you I take a look!
a party congress decides whether this happens. Then work starts on it.
No. It is currently a first draft of the work program for the next 2 years. Cohesion is one of the 4 issues. In December
"Hello Julia, this is part of the thematic forum cohesion."
that&#39;s why he&#39;s a good one. despite association by the way: your congratulations have not yet arrived ...

Do you tweet like @Nico from parents&#39; evening? https://twitter.com/mathiasrichel/status/914920563549843456…
we participated in the upper limit? please read again ....
"Right. Well, unfortunately there was always a majority in the SPD for that."
being against the upper limit is therefore a &quot;stealing responsibility&quot; - exciting;)
good luck.
where was the condition in the koav at that time for vds?
"at the latest now we would have got out, yes. there is no upper limit with spd."
Are there any reactions from the future coalition partners @Die_Gruenen and @fdp about the union&#39;s ceiling deal?
"Upper limit 200,000?"
Who says that?
pretty best enemies https://twitter.com/zdfheute/status/917045281819987968…
Congratulation!!! 👍🏻
