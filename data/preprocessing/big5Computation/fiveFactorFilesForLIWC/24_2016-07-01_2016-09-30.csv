but I am not surprised that AKP or Gray Wolves recognize themselves in the AfD. Thank you for the confirmation.
Your connections are also a question of content @ard
"Yes, but until everyone realizes this, you have to try a few times @ard"
why did you appear at so many ATIB events? For what purpose? In what role?
"There is nothing better, but she also needs Democrats. @dieLinke @SWagenknecht"
