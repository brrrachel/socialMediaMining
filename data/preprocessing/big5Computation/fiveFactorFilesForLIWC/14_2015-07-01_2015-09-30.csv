We demand that the #border controls remain until the refugee problem is resolved at European level.
It is unfortunate that all reception facilities had to be overcrowded before listening to the voice of reason.
These left-wing ghost drivers have led #Greece to an irresponsible crash course.
The willingness to integrate according to the rules of German #culture culture is the basic requirement for staying here. #CSU
"Language, values, basic order and culture are essential pillars of our living together. #Conductivity #CSU"
We have to prevent people who come to us from living next to us or against us in Germany.
We need clear rules for integration. #Refugees
The EU desk perpetrators have to do an internship in a refugee facility or at a border post to get to know the reality.
"The loss of reality in Brussels must end, otherwise we will have a very fundamental problem in the European Union."
"In Germany, the burden of accepting refugees has been significantly exceeded."
The #EU itself fails to cope with the refugee crisis. And now the EU wants to enforce an expansion of the rules on immigration.
It would be the wrong way to stop talking to each other in this difficult situation in Europe.
Oppermann is a politician with blinkers. The SPD is afraid of the truth.
Completely gaga when the SPD thinks about guests at the CSU conference. Orban is elected prime minister of an EU member state.
There is no way around an upper limit. We cannot accept everyone who wants to join us.
Germany&#39;s receptivity is not infinite &amp; when the limit is reached it must be called stop.
People come to us who are registered in other European countries. States were safely accommodated &amp; now simply want to go to Germany.
"Germany not only has a massive influx of refugees, but now simply uncontrolled migration."
"We have been demanding #border controls for months with this rush. Unfortunately, it is only so late now that others also become reasonable."
"The voice of reason in refugee policy is @CSU. A clear yes to humanity, a clear no to unbridled influx."
RT @CSU: Bavarian state government has decided on a 12-point immediate program to deal with the refugee situation. http://t.co/khRw...
"RT @CSU: Important signal! At the Bavarian initiative, Germany is temporarily reintroducing #border controls. http://t.co/Wp4H18knU9"
The @CSU presented a catalog of measures months ago. It is now a matter of making concrete political decisions. #Asylum
Mr. Oppermann should rather recognize and appreciate the humanitarian achievements of the Bavarian helpers and officials on site.
Bavaria picks up the brunt of coping with the influx of refugees. We will not drop any derogatory comments from Mr. Oppermann.
Europe must demand a real contribution from the entire Arab world to humanitarian reception of refugee flows.
"Saudi Arabia&#39;s behavior of not accepting refugees, but wanting to build mosques in Germany, is more than cynical."
"He was a fighter with a heart for the people in his homeland, but above all a very good friend. https://t.co/NcJDPzSFxk"
Thinking out loud here is wrong from a family policy perspective. Childcare allowance is fixed in the coalition &amp; the money is due to the families.
"According to a newspaper report, the @BMF_Bund wants the financial resources of the # childcare allowance to flow into the general budget."
"Citizens no longer want money and skills in Europe, but European solutions."
Europe would have enough to do with the mega-issue of asylum and refugee policy.
"Rewarding countries for wrong management and punishing D for good budgetary policies is the wrong, the socialist way for the EU."
"The #CSU says no to a European transfer union, as demanded by France&#39;s Economics Minister Macron!"
"The Bayern-SPD makes no contribution to the advancement of Bavaria, instead it wants the benefits from Degrading the bouquet. # 100JahreFJS"
It is poor like the Bavarian. Opposition misused the national memory of Franz J. Strauß to appear in the media again.
"RT @maischberger: promises an exciting start to the season: @TilSchweiger, @ AnjaReschke1, @AndiScheuer and others discuss the refugee crisis! Mo ..."
The #CSU has a heart for the families and we will fight for the families. #Betreuungsgeld
"In #Bavaria, three quarters of all eligible families receive # childcare allowance."
But it would be a gross family political sin to make politics against hundreds of thousands of families in Germany.
Family Minister Schwesig is on the wrong track. She plans to use # childcare allowance for day care centers in the future.
"Germany will not be able to solve crises in this world alone, even if Hofreiter calls for &quot;legal escape opportunities&quot; to Germany."
This realistic and ideologically deluded policy cannot be done with us!
One thing is becoming increasingly clear in the # asylum debate: the Greens want an even greater number of refugees than before.
"RT @CSU: Separation necessary: On the one hand, war refugees in need of protection, on the other hand, economic refugees without any beep…"
RT @CSU:. @ AndiScheuer speaks #Klartext in the # Asylum discussion of the Bild am Sonntag with Anton Hofreiter. http://t.co/rwAHLnKxmb
The fact that they all defame those who point to problems as agitators shows only the ideological blindness of the Greens. #Asylum
Looking forward to #LITC tonight at P1 in Munich with many friends and acquaintances. Are you there too? http://t.co/xbduF61NMU
"If an asylum application is rejected, the applicant must leave the country or be deported."
We have to focus on the core of asylum law and help those who really need protection.
"We shouldn&#39;t be talking about an immigration law, but an asylum abuse prevention law."
Just recorded a switch conversation with the @heutejournal for #care allowance. Runs at 9.45 p.m. @ZDF. http://t.co/TbwkCeqv0w
RT @CSU: Today was our first Facebook Q&amp;A. Thank you for your questions! We are looking forward to the next time! #fragCSU https://t.co/8WvKkL…
Done! My first Facebook Q&amp;A was super exciting. Looking forward to next time. #fragCSU
"If you want to prevent the mood of society from tipping over, you must finally tackle the influx effectively. #Asylum"
Stegner and co do nothing about the massive asylum abuse in Germany. It is a complete denial of reality. #Asylum
"#Bavaria will pay # childcare allowance. This is the moment of truth for the Prime Ministers Kraft, Kretschmann and Dreyer."
The families are entitled to the money: all countries have to show their colors whether they have one for the families who look after their children at home.
The content remains the same: The #care allowance is the right answer to the family challenges of our time.
"If the federal government is not responsible for formal reasons, the money must be made available to the federal states. #Betreuungsgeld"
"The BVerfG only made a purely formal, technical decision regarding the # childcare allowance and reorganized the responsibilities."
Looking forward to my first Facebook Q&amp;A. Tomorrow 5pm on the CSU-FB side. #fragCSU
@maybritillner Conjunctives from scientists and experts do not help now. Fact: Solidarity only exists against reforms!
RT @CSU: #Greece steers in: #Tsipras has to bow to the pressure to reform. All information is available here: http://t.co/v0EUvLV2sx http://t.co/l5…
RT @CSU: #Seehofer supports Merkel&#39;s #Greece course. Our principle remains: solidarity is only possible against solidity. https://t.co/Lp...
"I am deeply dismayed about the death of Philipp @ Missfelder, my sincere condolences to his family, a good friend goes way too early!"
@DJanecek The Greens agreed to all measures and much worse: Greece was admitted to the Eurozone in 2000 under Red-Green.
"@DJanecek - Do you want to follow Greens #SuperdemocratsTsipras who kidnaps his country, people and parliament? -Elephants have thick skin!"
#Varoufakis has caused a major fire in Europe and is now running away with the match.
RT @CSU: Tsipras and his left government lied to the people and pretended that there were euros without reforms. #Greferendum http://t.co/jR…
"RT @CSU: Kali nichta, Hellas - good night, #Greece! You are now taking a very difficult path. #Greferendum"
@CDeutschlaender - Frustration at having to sit in the PK at 30 degrees? Stay cool is air-conditioned.
Full commitment for Bavaria! Party board meeting on the hottest day of the year. #CSU
"Congratulations, dear Ozan Iyibas, on being elected chair of the CSU&#39;s Migration and Integration Working Group. http://t.co/S9BFsnTUnp"
RT @CSU: Great success for #CSU: Previously planned new #Monsterstromtrasse across #Bayern could be prevented. http://t.co/wluwNiGe...
"The two monster routes through #Bavaria are dead! When expanding the network, the formula is now: 2 minus a maximum of XXL. #Energy transition"
Top agreement on the #energy turn in the Berlin coalition! Agreement is the greatest possible success in all respects for #Bayern and #CSU.
