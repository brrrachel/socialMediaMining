Did the FDP insist on voting in the ALDE parliamentary group before voting in the legal committee? Yes or no?
Very simple question (for the third time): Has the FDP insisted on a vote in the ALDE group? Yes or no?
"Did you read my post? To be against it is not enough, you have to act where you can"

"The vote took place in the legal committee, where all (!) SPD representatives voted against #Uploadfilter. The FDP is not represented there, but previously failed to organize a vote in the ALDE group. As a result, ALDE has voted for (!) #Uploadfilter"
"True, 1968 was a grand coalition. The FDP was ‚Äúonly‚Äù involved in five increases. That of course makes the criticism totally credible ..."
"However, my example, which you contradicted, was four people. Since I don&#39;t have a tariff calculator, I can&#39;t calculate what tax will do. However, 120 euros of child benefit come in any case. In addition, the higher tax allowances and the reduction of the cold progression"
Does this mean that the FDP representatives did not previously insist on voting in the ALDE group? That is the basic requirement to prevent critical decisions. My goodness ...

The legislature is the Bundestag. Ms. Kl√∂ckner only announces an initiative by her ministry. Every bet: not even reached cabinet
Congratulations to @bonner_sc on staying up #Regionalliga
Contradiction. A quick declaratory action helps more than slow group performance suits. Why do you want to know better than consumer protection associations? #Suit for declaratory judgment #einefueralle
Are you deliberately confusing relative and absolute tax burdens? And: Was there actually a relief for normal taxpayers in 2009-2013 when you ruled?

"Just stay polite. You address the issue of &quot;cold progression&quot;, meaning that real, constant pensions are taxed more by inflation. We solve the problem by increasing the tax-free basic amount and regularly adjusting the tax rate http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/groko-was-union-und-spd-bei-steuern-und-finanzen-beschr√§nkt-haben-a- 1192302.html‚Ä¶"
"Some are tax free, some (increasing) are not. In return, expenses are tax-free beforehand. Is usually an advantage because the tax rate during employment is higher https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/de/Navigation/2_Rente_Reha/01_Rente/04_in_der_rente/01_rentenbesteuerung/00_rentenbesteuerung_node.html"
"It is rather frightening that you judged but did not understand the taxation system. Quite simply: With a higher income, only the plus is taxed higher, not the previous income. Consequence: an increase still works, between 55% and 100%"
