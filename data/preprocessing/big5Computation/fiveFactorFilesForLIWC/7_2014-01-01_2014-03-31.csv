Scheuer says that the CSU &quot;worked properly&quot; over the holidays - when anti-foreigners&#39; campaign is the result of Christian holidaysüò°üò´üò©
Are there actually no minimum intellectual standards? # # Scheuer CSU
The CSU secretary general Scheuer raves on ZDF and puts on the old anti-foreigner record. There is no right-wing populism in the KOA contract!
"If you want to fight AFD + NPD credibly and effectively, you shouldn&#39;t adopt their slogans or content. Helping municipalities is different!"
"CSU propaganda: &quot;Whoever cheats, he flies&quot; - there is nothing in the coalition agreement, Mr. Seehofer, that is right-wing populist curd!"

@christiansoeder It is not a question of whether this makes sense or where P. is more useful or harmful - I am concerned with the fundamental question of this process.
@christiansoeder Von Klaeden changed government directly into industry favored by political regulations of the government coalition.
@christiansoeder I&#39;m on maternity leave. I also have my opinion on the person Pofalla. Change from government to state corporation per se no scandal.

"After tax CDs etc., persecution pressure has become so high that arguments for exempting self-disclosure in tax fraud are obsolete!"
Celebrities cannot be treated better or worse than other accused. It is important that equality before the law applies!
"If it is evident that very wealthy tax criminals are treated like other criminals, this strengthens legal peace in Germany."
"There is also a reduction in the punishment for voluntary disclosure for other offenses, free purchase of super rich people from punishment does not fit our legal system!"

Anyone who discredits relaxation policy as appeasement has understood little!
@f_kierkegaard that was criticism of the right-wing populism of Messrs Freysinger &amp; Co. from the SVP with its unfortunate anti-Europe campaign.
@christiansoeder what&#39;s the alternative to diplomacy and d√©tente? Verbal saber rattling from the comfortable comment chair?
@christiansoeder not a language ban but maybe a contemplation requirement ?!
"@f_kierkegaard Robust competition + plaintext are definitely good and correct in democracy, but some questions require diplomacy!"
Frank Steinmeier and others are diplomatically trying to relax in Ukraine - that&#39;s the only sensible way! Some don&#39;t get it.
@RasmusAndresen because of ;-)

@DoroBaer Welcome to the north ;-)
@penzonator itself bullshit! Even more financial support from the state for Schleswig and Landestheater is really not possible!
CDU attempt to attack the SSW and Anke Spoorendonk in terms of Theater Schleswig is as transparent as it is poor - own goal calls!
The Chaos Union in the north alone is responsible for the crisis at the Landestheater and the political foolishness in Schleswig!
Schwarzgr√ºn in Schleswig puts the ax on the Landestheater. Local political tragedy in Schleswig and opposition leader Callsen does nothing.

Whimsical trash videos with retired prosecutors at DAS on NDR television. What people do in public ... ;-)
@_Mrs_Heart Bon appetit!
Social market economy = Suction dumping wages with tax coal + Defame pension as a social benefit instead of income from life performance? NO!
"&quot;Education, good work, decent wages, modern family policy = acceptable pensions and fewer social transfers from the tax office&quot;, stupid!"
@ulfposh @ArminLaschet A little thinking helps: Those who promote good work and help families with modern politics relieve social security funds!
@ r3obin @Volker_Beck there is great danger for Black Forest villages or the Upper Swabian province of educational gay missionaries!
On the way to the New Year&#39;s reception of the SPD in Rellingen - good that the modern cars are covered .... ;-)
I will always love this Morrison song ......
"Sit in the car + listen to &quot;Just like Greta&quot; by Van Morrison - if that&#39;s not something special, then this rain gray day can&#39;t harm you!"
Some political debate is hard to beat in terms of intellectual poverty; this applies to the BaW√º education plan and to europ. Migration!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Market before breakfast. Later at the SPD in Rellingen for the New Year&#39;s reception. RegenwinterüòÖüò∞

Au weia: It is colder in Atlanta than in Moscow. You can&#39;t even rely on the weather anymore. Father Frost goes West ;-)
&quot;Hooray - we are still alive&quot; - that is how the motto of the APO-Sause in the Stuttgart State Theater was yesterday. Stuttgart 21? Nah: Three (%) kings.

David McWilliams - Days Of Pearly Spencer- this is my music tip today ;-) http://youtu.be/4VDS8uArR0A
Go brutally - the Cologne # crime scene
@ Globetrotter128 Note: Tolls only compatible with 1.Eu law 2. More coal for tax authorities 3.No more cents for German car drivers. All understood? Bene!
Cologne crime scene at unusual times and from a jail perspective.
We will soon have a judgment - the applicable law will then be implemented by Heiko Maas. Where&#39;s the problem dear CSU? THAT is a good job!
"Heiko Maas by no means breaks the coalition agreement, but ensures implementation compliant with EU law, like Dobrindt with the toll, right ?!"
The super soldier of the universe- Last picture is burning in the Main crime scene.
"Teachers, soldiers, Americans, police officers, aliens, today&#39;s occupation list in the Main crime scene."
"Buckle up for the finale: bizarre #tatort story with crossed gene material: Germans, Americans and extraterrestrials in one crime scene."
"Farewell letters are already being dealt with online, nothing haptic before the last hello"
Seems to be going to aliens in the main crime scene.
The Beatles - Let it be Lyrics this is my music tip today ;-) http://youtu.be/0D5JJZl6MB0

Reinhard Mey - Seasons of a Life (album: Seasons 1980) - this is my music tip today ;-) http://youtu.be/oO3TlSg42r8
"@ArminLaschet rather less ;-) I only have passion for my party, everyone else I consider sober-voters determine coalitions."
"@ scHweizerin_x3 I have expressly highlighted those who, like you, voted &quot;No&quot; and thus for European values!"
Demanding more democracy from a pro-European perspective like Bofinger + Habermas is something completely different from Wagenknecht&#39;s &quot;facade democracy&quot;!
"J√ºrgen Habermas is pro-European and wants more democracy, Sahra Wagenknecht scorns the EU little left + with a more nationalistic undertone."
@hruodberaht So J√ºrgen Habermas really argues differently than Sahra Wagenknecht!
Anyone who insults Europe as &quot;facade democracy&quot; like Ms. Wagenknecht betrays an anti-European sentiment.
Good morning from Bordesholm.
