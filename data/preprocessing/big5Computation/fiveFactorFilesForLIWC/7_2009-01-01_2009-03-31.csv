"Self-criticism is appropriate for everyone who has been on committees, whether you have asked critical enough questions, including us. But there was never clairvoyance"
but always fought! Operational responsibility in the time since the crisis loomed not at SPD which is now being blamed!
"The global financial and banking crisis was not triggered in Kiel, nor was it predicted by the FDP, and certainly not called for stricter financial controls"
Nord-Union is desperately trying to shift responsibility for the past 4 years of finance and Nordbank policies because the wind is coming from the front

Return from Steinburg. 60 years of SPD membership honors always impressive.

Good discussion in the theater in Wedel. Onward journey to membership ceremony.
@petrahannelore not an acceptable choice of words!
@Stecki Not even the JU could &quot;drink&quot; the bad spots.

@filmfacts yes there is something and with networks in public hands that would be even more! Energy policy is a question of power - see also Hessen
"@Truck__Driver is right, but setting a good example is better than waiting for a big solution and doing nothing!"
"@AngelikaDorsch Socrates thought so too, far ahead of the virtual world! This opens up perspectives!"
"@Truck__Driver not exactly one argument per atom! Motto: The good atomic energy with us, the bad with others is corporate lobby spokesman!"
@vorwaerts_de absolutely yes!
@filmfacts what does large scale mean? Decentralized and municipal is better for work and the environment!
@Truck__Driver The main thing is that the SPD is against nuclear policy!
@tweet_music Simon &amp; Garfunkel &quot;Still crazy after all these years&quot;. Training felt good! Was something stupid today? Totally forgot.

@Truck__Driver probably wanted to get away from Pinkwart - such bad luck but the NRW Interior Minister is from the FDP
"@AndreJagusch in the Union would have got the wrong result after a long discussion, so per study fee!"
Who is this glos? Muellermeister CSU! How? Minister? You are out!
@AndreJagusch that you need a long discussion for this ?! Whoever introduces educational barriers instead of abolishing them no longer has them all!

Now Bundesliga on TV. HSV in Karlsruhe: 3 points for the north! Enjoyable Saturday. After soccer a little fitness training.
The alleged nuclear renaissance is a farce: a single new building plan in Finland and costs are exploding there. Bush-USA: Zero despite the big mouth
"Nuclear lobby is letting their apologists off the chain again. Do a nuclear election campaign: Pofalla, Clement, Westerwelle &amp; Co. That can only help SPD!"

@ Palatinate also come to Landau for congratulations!
@AngelikaDorsch is how it is in black and yellow coalitions. So fight for other majorities everywhere and also in NDS!
