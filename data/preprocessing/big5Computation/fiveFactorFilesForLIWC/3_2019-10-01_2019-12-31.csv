Where there is lack and suffering? A lot of things are not yet working well enough. Much will not survive the demographic change unscathed. That&#39;s why I want a big # welfare state T√úV. # cdupt19 2/2
"At the same time, we counteract poverty in old age, relieve high performers and companies and provide impulses for the future. We are strengthening occupational and private pensions, reducing unemployment benefits and investing 10 billion euros in digitalization and air conditioning technology. 2.2"
One thing is clear: &quot;Prosperity for All&quot; cannot mean &quot;Welfare for All&quot;. We need a # welfare state T√úV. An honest checkout.

The Bundeswehr is full of active people who do their work with passion and the highest level of commitment - even under difficult conditions. It is the task of politics to improve these framework conditions.
"A ready-to-use, fully equipped Bundeswehr is part of security policy capability. It starts with the financial resources: 1.5% by 2024 &amp; 2% by 2031. Not because others ask for it, but because it is in our own security interests."
"As Europe, we are strong - economically, politically and also militarily. If we want to be there and remove existing obstacles. If we don‚Äôt do it, we‚Äôll mess up. For me it is clear: this is only possible with a strong German-French tandem."
Germany has every reason to be braver. We stand firmly in a democratic &amp; rule of law tradition - deeply rooted in #NATO and #EU. It is time to draw strength and self-confidence from it to shape the world &amp; future together with our partners.
