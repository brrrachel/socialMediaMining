Didn&#39;t Merkel make the refugee question a top priority? Why does Seehofer&#39;s nationalistic talk remain unchallenged by Gabriel?
Do Seehofer / Orban + not Merkel determine the guidelines for German refugee policy or do they prepare for a rightward turn with their approval?
@kdshpger The federal government must strengthen its income. We suffer damage of 10 billion euros per year due to tax evasion etc.
The federal government is mainly thinking about refugee protection. Aren&#39;t we the third largest arms exporter to blame for flight?

@HugoMuellerVogg I sincerely hope that both subordinate their different geostrategic interests to this goal.
The fact that von der Leyen speaks out against German troops in Syria should be a matter of course for every federal government.
The goal must be to free people from the terror of war as quickly as possible + to show a perspective for Syria&#39;s reconstruction
I hope that Russia + the United States subordinate their different geo-strategic interests to the common goal for peace in Syria
