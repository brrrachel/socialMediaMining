I would have preferred to get rid of humps. But Lucke declined at the end of 14!
"It still remains wrong. While H√∂cke bit on granite with his wish for membership in the BuVo, Lucke had talks about K√∂lmel four weeks before Essen. We have always refused to cooperate."

It&#39;s funny that the AfD&#39;s BuVo tried bitterly to prevent 2016/2017.
They are simply giving the reader the wrong impression. I can assure you that @Uwe_Junge_MdL was anything but enthusiastic at the time.
"Without us, the AfD would have been done in 2015."
"Now please no details. That disturbs. In addition, you only had two years to research."
Does it still hurt? After two years? Really? Then it was right!
The intellectual avant-garde of the AfD. I recognized you right away.
Not if you take into account that Harder-K√ºhnel has been strengthening the unconstitutional wing within the party for years. But all those who have made the Nazi alarm in 2015 are now generously overlooking this.
"If you want to ruin my reputation ... Keep going. But always remember: I wanted to use weapons as the ultima ratio! And it&#39;s just cozy to the right of the middle, so that&#39;s clear!"

Harder-K√ºhnel moderating? So how inner party in Hessen? Very funny!
It is definitely not part of the moderate wing.
