@ PhoenixCP82 everything!
@Pirat_Robert Thought the round was complete?
@Theo_Straten I don&#39;t get it. Read our tweets in context. All the best!
@Theo_Straten That is why we finally want to reform the EEG - that was the starting point of the debate.
@Theo_Straten Aha - but the investors in solar parks with guaranteed returns that you would like to subsidize?
@Theo_Straten Counter question: Do you care about jobs in Germany in the energy-intensive aluminum production?
"@Theo_Straten Paying attention to the affordability of energy is, in your eyes, lobbying policy? They speak like the EEG solar lobby."
@Theo_Straten nonsense. We have been committed to reforming the EEG for a long time and for good reasons.
The Christmas break begins: contemplative days and all the best for 2013 - so that it will be an exciting new year.
"In #Lower Saxony, to exchange with @Stefan_Birkner and @christianduerr - we will talk about #debt brakes, among other things."
"With @JoachimStamp on the way to London, including discussions with Vice-MP Clegg and members of the House of Commons on Europe and relations with NRW."
@disadjusted Did you really look at the numbers? Or reflex and perceived temperature?
@Lis_Erbe @plsteinbrueck To understand: This is not Peer Steinbrück. That is satire.
"@genenano @plsteinbrueck @peersteinbrueck Sure, that&#39;s why &quot;Steinbrück&quot; and not Steinbrück."
@lis_erbe PS: You would also have to write &quot;Steinbrück&quot;.
"@PLSteinbrueck And you will create 10,000 followers here by the end of the year ... ;-)"
"@Lis_Erbe Sorry, where flags in the wind? You have apparently misunderstood your relationship with Steinbrück."
@mn_gb See France&#39;s youth unemployment. There is a minimum working conditions law in Germany to combat social upheavals.
"@mn_gb No, there are minimum wages. A minimum wage dictated uniformly by politicians would have more disadvantages than advantages."
@marianschreier Then every constitutional provision would be a &quot;gutting of politics&quot;. There was also the semi-division principle.
"@sven_giegold In general one should have examined the role of the state, private banks and public banks in Germany."
"@sven_giegold At the FDP, a U committee on WestLB would not fail."
@ben__schaefer That is why the structural compensation will be created in 2014. Two years before the debt brake.
@sven_giegold Do that support the Greens?
@ PhoenixCP82 You misunderstand.
@__FMR__ I&#39;m curious to see what that is.
@guck_mal Where would there be joint projects?
"@ben__schaefer Well, the federal budget figures are impressive."
"@__FMR__ So, is that you? I prefer that to no guardrail. Would also need a citizen burden brake."
@ PhoenixCP82 The federal government has been doing this for years: shows the dimension. And as a voter you also have responsibility for this.

"@netnrd Nice polemic. But unfortunately, your proposals (if there are any) read like those of the left faction of the last period. Coincidence?"
