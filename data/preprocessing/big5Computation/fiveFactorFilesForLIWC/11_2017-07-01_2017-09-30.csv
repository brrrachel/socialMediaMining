The question is whether my broadcasting policy and conviction make me the right target for this criticism.
"I don&#39;t adjust my tweets here just to please you. Regardless of that, I really appreciate both of them."
You obviously don&#39;t accept the broadcasting constitution. Should I keep feeding you?

"We are happy to discuss the failure of the supervision of broadcasting councils, I am with you, but politics cannot interfere."
"According to the constitution, countermeasures must be done outside the state. The supervision is carried out under public law, not state, by the broadcasting council."
