@aribertdecker&#39;s apology for trying to be self-ironic. ;-) #HiggsBoson
@flueke ;-)
"@fr_schirrmacher If I knew exactly who I was, I would no longer tweet, I would just rest in myself. :-)"
"RT @caixin: Authorities release 21 detained in #Sichuan #copper project protests..   http://english.caixin.com/2012-07-04/100407404.html … ""A spark can light a prairie fire."""
"Hey, @fr_schirrmacher, nice that you also fulfill ironic prayers: &quot;Give us our daily ponader today!&quot;"
"Higgs-Boson, I read in FAZ, &quot;has no spin&quot;. So it&#39;s pretty politically uninteresting, isn&#39;t it? Can that be at all - no spin?"
There are beautiful mornings in Heidelberg when the sun illuminates the Neckar fog that moves to the Königstuhl. That&#39;s where my questions from the evening come from.
@heusebio Very nice. What century was that?
"@WeAreAllGreeks True: poor people in Greece suffer most, which is unjust. True: crisis's been mishandled by EU. But don't play #nationalism."
@ Peter Honorable Seems to me a difference to Kohl / Strauss back then: Kohl knew how to explain his perspective to Strauss popularly
"@PeterEhrlich Fears, Seehofer&#39;s threats gain weight, the bigger the balancing act between what Merkel does + what she explains."
"@WeAreAllGreeks Well, for a start, I would differentiate between the needs of the people and their wishes. Solving a crisis is no wish list."
#Merkel can have a choice: Seehofer + Rösler give in + sacrifice euros or kick them out + form the government with today&#39;s opposition.
"#Seehofer: # coalition breach because of #EU? &quot;That others want our money without being too demanding,&quot; he criticizes the EU summit."
@PaulBarasi My policy: pursuing #human rights issues while separating them from any #separatist agenda on basis of Europe's 1-#China-Policy.
"@ aotto1968_2 Sorry, Mr. Otto, I find the question stupid. How do I get there? Green politics is there in the &quot;German interest&quot;!"
#Barroso gets really out of it in the #EP in the debate about # EU summit: &quot;We overcome this crisis together or we will all fail together.&quot;
". @ j4kob Merkel did not give in - a bit - because Greens + SPD &quot;weakened&quot; them, but because their course would have led to chaos."
@Tibet_TW You guys definitely know how to make many friends. :-P
CDU: &quot;The fact is that the necessary communication with the SPD and the Greens has influenced the Chancellor&#39;s room for negotiation.&quot; Rightly so!
EBD-Spöri pleads for a referendum in favor of EU integration in the medium term. You have to win civil society for integration! # EBDMV12
Dieter Spöri leaves today as President of the #EBD. Has done enormous things for European ideas. I came especially to pay him respect.
@svenlehmann Don&#39;t make a discussion about it! Just don&#39;t give meaning at all.
@JakobCSchwarz We have not discussed this. I would support these plans.
@Lakritsbiten @teirdes @ruitavares I'll probably be rooting for the Italian team.
@BikeTaxiGuy Try to get in touch with michael.cramer@europarl.europa.eu - he is THE bike guy.
"@WeAreAllGreeks Is ""Greece"" the victim of the #crisis, when: rich didn't pay taxes + patronage abounded + public money was being squandered?"
"@WeAreAllGreeks ""#Greece is victim of the crisis, nothing else."" What? #Nationalist self-victimization is no way out. Only feeds resentment."
@HerrWartenberg No acceptance of advantage if the piggy had any similarity. ;-)
@DJanecek You also have to finish second. ;-) But asked more precisely: Are you now betting on pure red-green?
Is it everywhere that at high school balls all great / best / great teachers get food vouchers + cinema vouchers from their ex-pupils?
@bene_lux And then down the snake path back to the Neckar - with a pram. -P
@DJanecek Whether that will now benefit Fritz in his OB election campaign in narrow Stuttgart when you celebrate him as a FC Bayern fan? ;-)
"@dani_sch If you start like this, Dani ... ;-)"
"@WeAreAllGreeks What do you mean: ""of course, it hits people in poverty only.""? That can be changed, can't it?"
@TheSchmah can also dream an EU commissioner. ;-) That will be clear. Now look forward to today&#39;s success!
Prom at #HD # Helmholtz-Gymnasium: almost longer than one EP session day - 6-3 p.m. ;-) Was faster for me in &#39;71; my Rex: &quot;Get out!&quot;
@TheSchmah ACTA is off the table. May be that some will try to revive parts of it. Nobody knows that at the moment.
This is what winners look like! http://bit.ly/RbglfR #ACTA
".@TheProgressives Look, it is ridiculous to say S&D killed ACTA. You helped killing it, and that is fine. No need to be overly boastful. ;-)"
"Yes, the &quot;ghost drivers&quot; from the right got a removal from #ACTA. ;-) They had resigned themselves before, but #barked again."
MEP #Lehne zu ACTA: &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be the ghost drivers on the # Internet freeway that should determine our policies.&quot; #ACTA still gone with 478 NO!

@wettach tell how it ends.
@PaulBarasi Once more: supporting #human rights of #Tibetan citizens of China does not imply promoting a separatist Tibetan agenda. #1-China
"@thelasthb No, I'm not."
@svenlehmann Of course not. But I think it&#39;s a good question. ;-)
#Schick wants to be # Özdemir green # top candidate from BaWü to Bundestag election. Then why doesn&#39;t he compete as a # BuVo candidate?
@BabettesChefin It doesn&#39;t stay the way it is. ;-)
