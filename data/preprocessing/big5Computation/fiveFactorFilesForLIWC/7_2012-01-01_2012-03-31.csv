Last hurray for Oskar! Once again he messed up the SPD - in SH + NRW it goes out of the state parliament. Saar-CDU can thank him!
The secure grand coalition has turned our voters off - even if there was hardly a reasonable alternative. Too bad for Heiko Maas!

(3) ergo: black and yellow has been responsible for aggravating the educational problems in SH for 21/2 years! Quod erat demonstrandum!
"(2) Quite the opposite and harasses community schools, thus exacerbating the problems that we want to solve with longer learning together!"
"It&#39;s funny how black and yellow educators argue: Bertelsmann study demands social permeability, black and yellow does that (1)"
Again for the black and yellow friends in plain text: Yesterday&#39;s CDU / FDP education policy in SH blocks conclusions from the Bertelsmann study!
@nilskassube what an intelligent submission by the FDP: it was not about the database but black-and-yellow harassment against longer learning together!
@myBordesholm with Klamauk the 5% hurdle non-governmental balance of black and yellow is simply miserable. Lobbyism instead of common good!
"(2) Instead of promoting longer joint learning, black and yellow harasses in SH community schools + wants expensive Y-nonsense + tripartism!"
Bertelsmann study on the social permeability of our education system shows fatal consequences of the anti-social CDU / FDP chaos course in SH (1).

@davidwelsch well the intellectual development is remarkable!
ZDF showed how CDU &amp; FDP rely on R.Callmund + Boris Becker when it comes to adding value in SH. Dieter Bohlen will probably help with school policy.
Frontal 21 of ZDF reported yesterday about political ghosting by Arp &amp; Kubicki &amp; Co. when legalizing illegal gambling in SH.
Mr. Schlie apparently has a sense of humor: this is about as likely as to rely on Christian von Boetticher becoming Federal President in 2017.
At yesterday&#39;s ceremony: Interior Minister Schlie&#39;s 5-year state command SH said Interior Minister Schlie was looking forward to a 10-year celebration as Minister!

"Ex-partners in the Kiel law firm Graf Kerssenbrock (CDU) and FDP-Kubicki, according to the KN, fight each other in court because of fraud or extortion!"
@peteraltmaier Angela Merkel is certainly grateful for this form of PR work. It&#39;s almost Peter Hintze&#39;s class.

Perhaps Amigo Berlusconi could help out with newspaper purchases so that the &quot;parasitic reporting&quot; (Hintze) against Wulff finally stops!
President Wulff praises German anti-corruption laws when visiting Italy. Missing flaming speech against bargain hunter mentality!
Consistent: Deliver even bad work + stand up for poorly paid work. CDU / FDP government votes in the Federal Council against minimum wages.

Good morning from Bordesholm. Ice-cold Tuesday today. In addition preparation party congress.
"Dobrindt wants to ban the Left Party, Union man Heveling predicts the end of the Internet age, house searches in the Presidential Office-2012 = cool"
A Heveling cult looms: Icon for a German tea party? TOP topic for the TODAY SHOW.
Ansgar Heveling or CDU 2.0: a conservative party and the brave champion for the world from yesterday&#39;s pretty Monday story.
Only those who don&#39;t know SPD can believe the nonsense with alleged support for large coalitions. We want red-green wherever possible!
Unusual: Sunstroke in January: “@: [SPON] Secret service affair: Dobrindt brings left ban into play: http://bit.ly/yApug9”
Music tip: Eagles &quot;New Kid in town&quot;. Have a nice start every week!

Sun over snow-covered fields in Brandenburg-beautiful music from the car speakers-good thoughts; -}
@bueti na na- my preference clearly red-green-in SH SPD only party that says that clearly. I&#39;m really not a friend of large coalitions!
@KarlFSchmidt is now pain free!
@bueti after all -I mean social-democratically led governments in Saarland and SH- preferably red-green policy changes in the north!
Now on the way to the party executive board meeting in Potsdam. Setting the course for a successful social democratic year 2012!

"On the day of the testimony in SH, the minister of education is in acute danger of being transferred."
Opposition counts the coalition in such a way that one could almost feel sorry for the government of chaos.
Education debate in the state parliament with persistence slogans of the black and yellow Wagenburg coalition around sad Minister of Education
@RASimoneWeber you a nice Friday!
Good Friday everyone who started here with a powdery layer of snow. So there is winter!

"After the state parliament session, open SPD office on the subject of integration policy. Nice guests, good mood. Many rely on #PolitikwechselSH"
Picturesque dawn when driving to the office - could be a good day!
Interesting editorial in the ZEIT about the first term of office of US President Barack Obama.
&quot;Old Shatterbrain&quot; -ZEIT attests Kiel faction leader of the consumptive yet ruling party reduced intellectual performance.
The thing with Christian Wulff is a tragedy that only he can end because the Chancellor doesn&#39;t want to. We currently have no BP!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today various Berlin appointments. Music tip: David Bowie &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. Have a nice start to the week!
"@Volker_BeckDoes not. Attitude to fiscal policy at the Left Party is completely unrealistic. If you want just politics, the SPD does not choose the Left Party"
@Volker_Beck @sz_politik what&#39;s wrong with that?
What a debacle for HSV against the German champions.
"Unfortunately, one has to say that BVB is clearly superior to HSV today in all respects."
that won&#39;t happen-bet? !!! “@HerrBertling: Then let&#39;s see how HSV loses to BVB :)”

@SoenkeRix on the road to Berlin....rainy nights in Meck-Pomm....
"@borgulf the cabaret artist would say: If such a man can become head of government, our Hansi will also graduate ..."
"@manomama is right, enjoy it!"
"@RasmusAndresen On the contrary: The following applies to SH: if you really want red-green, you have to choose SPD. We clearly say preference! The CDU squint!"
"well-there is also a lot of curd cheese “@christiansoeder: Kubicki says clever things, like most. It’s really a shame if the FDP goes down in SH.”"
"@KonstantinNotz Such nonsense, the clarity of the northern SPD in the political orientation and preference do not have others (look in the mirror!"
It&#39;s about the culprits after the electoral defeat “@SoenkeRix: Stay honest #Kubicki! #FDP was before &quot;Fall #Wulff&quot; below 5% http://tinyurl.com/7jctxkd ”
@von_bronkhorst @spdde You talked about SH SPD - nobody really aims at a grand coalition here!
"Hello? Which victory? “@ Davidwelsch: Kubicki on Wulff&quot; If this continues, the CDU + FDP victory in state elections can cost &quot;. Stab-in-the-Back Myth?&quot;"
@von_bronkhorst @spdde @spdsh certainly not!
"In the end, most of the voters, but also party supporters, differentiate content-related convictions from power-political tactics!"
"Black and yellow is dead as a mouse: So instead, black and green is longed for and written in by those who are against real policy changes."
"There are already a lot of whistles in the basement, and SH will only vote in almost four months. #PolitikwechselSH"
"And the chancellor gives SH-Union blessings for black-green, blames SH SPD and praises Nord-Grüne for similarities with a run-down CDU. Hmm."
Notable press review: FDP-Kubicki says Wulff jeopardizes black and yellow election victory in SH. What do you have to take for such perceptions?
Have a good start to the week!

Agony in Bellevue Palace is lead heavy over this beginning of the year - a good end for the incumbent probably no longer.
"Talk about Fehmarnbelt crossing, IHK reception with energy debate, media appointments and community reception Kronshagen-full day."
@bueti these are terms such as intensive animal husbandry or disgusting meat ... just does not match the wellbeing exam at the beginning of the year ...
Today appointments in Kiel and Kronshagen. Music tip: Rio Reiser &quot;Sonnenallee&quot;. May this be one for you this Thursday!

@knuddellove in the cold; -}
"Investing in childcare, education, good work + consistent energy transition + climate protection saves social transfer costs sustainably + fairly!"

Media also report polls see black and yellow on the upwind - yellow part is clearly below 5% and red-green is clearly in front. This is politics!
Newspapers actually print CDU election poster today with Mr. de Jager and a gray scarf (half green with a green photo). #Greenwashing
Today the SPD state party conference in Lübeck begins: election of the top candidate Torsten Albig and decision of the government program. # PolitikwechselSH2012

CDau was probably a Freudian typo ...; -} I meant the chaos at the CDU and its half-strong coalition remnant.
Happy Thursday everyone!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Watch government chaos from CDau / FDP again today in the state parliament. Music tip: Talking Heads &quot;Road to nowhere&quot;.
Exciting experiment by the state government: SH citizens are really not interested in politics or is this only true for the Prime Minister?
"The logic of the SH coalition is: Every headline is good, substance + seriousness are sniffing - the main thing that occurs in the media"
Today in the state parliament again signs of disintegration of the dubious CDU / FDP coalition.
"A good 3 months before the SH election, the black-and-yellow government coalition is picking up hopes for a PR effect - underestimated voter intelligence. # PolitikwechselSH"
"Left-wing party conservative, not suitable for government in the West + on the way out of parliaments - it is not dangerous - observation = nonsense!"
I wish everyone in this timeline a happy Wednesday!
Good morning from Bordesholm.Today&#39;s state parliament.Music tip especially for our black and yellow chaos troupe: Frank Sinatra &quot;Send in the clowns&quot;.
"Black and yellow state government is publicly taking action after 2 years of dubious lobbying politics, educational chaos, bankruptcies, bad luck &amp; glitches"
The long session ends with a discussion at the Open Channel. Signs of dissolution in the worst SH state government since 1949.
There was probably an FDP man who said more than 10%. @ Tagesspiegel_de: #Linkspartei calls for the introduction of cannabis clubs http://tinyurl.com/7bqndzz ”
The replacement train actually leaves - today Berlin Hamburg about 4.5 hours instead of 90 minutes. If everything goes smoothly now - toi toi toi!
@ Atila4DU thank you!
Game accident stops ICE in the middle of nowhere-1.5h delay session day in the bucket-thanks for traveling with Deutsche Bahn! Wild boar?
Right away a radio interview and then off to the train station. Happy Tuesday everyone!
Good morning from Berlin. Today back to SH and parliamentary groups to prepare the state parliament. Music tip: Status quo &quot;Whatever you want&quot;.
"A Federal President acts through personal authority, not that of the office. Christian Wulff has lost this authority."
This week in the state parliament we are experiencing the weakest Minister of Education SH has ever had. He is not even supported by his own top candidate.
"Who at 3.9% max. stands + claims that he reaches 9% until the election, gets headlines. 3 months + 2 weeks until the election. 1% per month = 9% says K. Any questions?"
@augensternchen_ good night!
@manomama sometimes I really believe that ...; -}
The feeling of being ashamed is more common in real life than one would like. # PolitikwechselSH2012

"Good morning from Bordesholm. Today the parliamentary bodies, reception at a radio station and evening preparations for the state party convention."
@bueti @vorwaerts the whole system is sick. The primacy of democratic politics ?!
@RasmusAndresen agrees; -}
"@RasmusAndresen I do not say that, but the emphasis on work and justice is more pronounced for us, the ecological one for you."
"@RasmusAndresen Our positions on school policy, energy policy, social policy, tax policy, to name just a few examples!"
"Compatible means compatible, but by no means the same!"
Differences are seen by those who want to see them: good work + justice are standards for SH SPD and compass = contrast to CDU / FDP compatible to green!
@RasmusAndresen I am very calm there. The voters who want real policy changes and nothing with run-down CDU understand that exactly!
"@RasmusAndresen otherwise we do not take anyone, everyone makes their own campaign but we pour voters pure wine. # Red-green"
@RasmusAndresen Fact is: SPD SH makes a clear announcement: We want coalition with Greens + if necessary. SSW. Greens say &quot;independence&quot; = flirt with CDU.
Good morning from Bordesholm. For the New Year&#39;s reception in the Lower Saxon neighborhood of Achim. Music tip: Chi Coltrane &quot;The wheel of life&quot;.

"The continued Dieckmann-Wulff duel is not a fundamental argument about freedom of the press, but is rather an unworthy staging + no level"
Rösler&#39;s pure growth course as a new FDP slogan really makes sense for a 2% party. Maybe doubling up to SH election works: Toi toi toi!
Right at the North Frisian SPD in Riesum-Lindholm. Start of the 2012 election year. # Policy changeSH2012
"Morning humor on the radio: FDPSH boss Garg philosophizes about Jamaica coalition in Kiel, who wants FDP in parliament or even government?"

"There were Bible quotes, a few tears were still missing in the end. rightly says: For the first time, a Federal President pardoned himself, which was nothing"
"The Federal President is responsible for fundamental questions and orientation, and Christian Wulff has completely lost orientation on his own behalf."
Christian Wulff will find it very difficult to regain the authority and integrity required for a head of state.
Music tip: Pink Floyd &quot;Wish you were here&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone!
"Ultimately, this is attributed to &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;politicians&quot; as if &quot;they&quot; really exist! Causa Wulff harms communities!"
"Good morning from Bordesholm. It becomes lonely for Merkel&#39;s president. Nevertheless, there is no point in relying on party political profit!"

"@knutraisdorf is not about congratulations, but about the behavior of regional politicians from splinter parties, who are pushing in front of the cameras."
@ victor5679 such a pinch of intelligence is really not harmful ...; -}
100 abstentions show the irritation in the Merkel &amp; Rösler troop.
"Congratulations go to Federal President Joachim Gauck, whom the SPD + Greens had nominated in 2010, this time parts of the CDU &amp; FDP voted!"
"Joachim Gauck is the new Federal President, leading representatives congratulate him, then important people urge Kubicki, Lindner &amp; Co. into the camera light."

@c_vogt confident but not overbearing; first work is hard until May 6th. and then spread the bearskins - not the other way around!
@ aotto1968_2 keep dreaming!
I like that! “@ DieMarginalen: Are you already happy? On Sunday after the # Gauck election we will praise ourselves again! ”
Finally put an end to the black and yellow alliance of conservatives and selfish people at the expense of the common good. Progress + justice are possible!
