The basis for this would be to invest significantly more money in education - the Federal Government does not. TL

That is precisely why we from @fdpbt were on site and were looking for direct exchange with the farmers. The measures presented by the federal government are far from life and a frontal attack on agriculture! TL
In the #Bundestag there are # parliamentary committees in which members of all political groups can control the work in the ministries. The only exception: the # Federal Chancellery. @fdpbt therefore calls for the establishment of such a committee!

Good to hear. The direct exchange with the farmers is important! TL
"In any case, Federal Education Minister Anja Karliczek has not ended the small-scale wrangling between the federal and state governments. TL"
"Why do you think that? @Fdpbt is on the side of the farmers: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/143/1914343.pdf… We urgently need more respect for those who feed our country. The federal government&#39;s agricultural policy, on the other hand, deprives an entire industry of its livelihood! TL"
"However, the federal government does not reconcile this. The result is unfair competition. That is why we need uniform framework conditions at European level! TL"
Do you really mean simplify? 🧐 Where we are probably in agreement: The fact that school success in Germany depends much more on the family home than in other countries is a disastrous testimony to the education policy of the federal government! TL

"4. We have been experiencing an expansion of what can be said about law for several years now - with breaking taboos, deliberately violating statements and open ethnic thinking. At the same time (and partly as a reaction) there is a hypersensitive monitoring of political correctness from the left."

We submitted an application to the Bundestag in June. This can be found here: http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/111/1911105.pdf… TL
We are therefore requesting a current hour this week in the #Bundestag on the Ibrahim #Miri case and the enforcement of the rule of law! TL
"We offer protection to those who flee from threats to their lives, war and torture - not to those who want to pursue their serious criminal activities in peace. I expect the quickest possible decision on his asylum application to be made a priority. CL"
The fact that the head of a Lebanese clan is now back in Germany despite deportation in June and a ban on re-entry throws a bad light on the security structure in the Schengen area. It is cynical that #Miri has now also applied for asylum.
"The escalation of violence in #Hongkong worries me. If the state media call for a &#39;harder line&#39;, we should leave no doubt that Germany would also go a hard line: namely for # freedom of expression and # human rights. CL"

We are not coalitioning with any party that questions our system. Neither from the left nor from the right. TL
Ah and you think that the difference between a social democratic party and a socialist party was not known to Scheel? TL
"The left is a socialist party and wants to change our SYSTEM, not politics. This has nothing to do with moving away from individual positions, but with the backbone! TL"
Wanting to talk the liberal party into a coalition with a socialist party is absurd. Responsibility for state policy presupposes adherence to election promises. CL # ltwth19
The @fdp_thueringen campaigned for the replacement of red-red-green. Now Mr. Habeck criticizes us for sticking to what we said before after the election.
That was a heartbeat finale last night. Every vote for the Free Democrats made a difference! Now there is a liberal force in the Thuringian state parliament - and it is looking forward to tackling it. Congratulations to @KemmerichThL &amp; @fdp_thueringen! CL # ltwh19 pic.twitter.com/Fwc90spCVn
