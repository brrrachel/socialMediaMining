"Striegel (Greens) once again accuses AfD of racism, populism and contempt for human beings in the plenary because we stand up for the German people."

Merkel spoke about bloody deed in Munich in the same breath with Nice and Würzburg. Appropriate or &quot;right baiting&quot; as from AfD ???
De Maizière was talking about the terror situation around Munich ... how could he !!! What do the link ideologists say?
#AfD has long been pointing to the security situation in D + EU: #Political failure; Leftist radicals prefer to rush and threaten courage to the truth
"#AfD Munich: Our sympathy for the bereaved and injured, our disgust for Merkelers and idiots who share responsibility!"
Foreign press has long reported on Islam terror in Munich. German blinded doers drool around. You are complicit!
And whose work is it when Islamic terror turns out?
Merkel Unity Party: thanks for the terror in Germany and Europe!
