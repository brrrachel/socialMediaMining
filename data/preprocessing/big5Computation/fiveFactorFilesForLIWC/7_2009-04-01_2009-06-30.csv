@patrickziebke problem with it?
@ osna112 have fun!
Drive home to Salzauer Kieler Woche reception.
Nice SPD party in Berlin. Back to the hotel.
"Faction ends, press talk, then municipal round."
Theoretical considerations do not help! # Ssp09stegner
The Union&#39;s tax program obviously does not come from the Baron zu Guttenberg but from the Baron Muenchhausen! #AktionWaehlertaeuschung
On the way to committee meetings in Berlin. Morning press reports extensively and critically about the # Tri-Tra-Trullala tax policy of the Union
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Marius Mueller-Westernhagen &quot;Get up&quot;. Nice beginning of the week everyone!
@DennisGladiator This CDU / CSU tax murmur is really no reason for SPD nervousness - there is probably the wish father of thought!
Nice fireworks at the end of the Kiel Week. Many people met at the NDR reception!
@frederics was it not the Union that presented its tax bureau package today?
@asozialdemokrat would you like that ?!
Tax concept of the Union 2009: CDU &quot;We promise everyone everything&quot; CSU &quot;and that immediately&quot;! # Beer lid concept again with quite a few strokes!
@JU_Hoffmeister Tax concept of the SH SPD from 2004: Control differently: Still good and fair!
@amselwilli they have promised nothing they want to keep!
But honestly: The tax concept of the Union applies until September 27th. 6:00 p.m. promised!
The Union has an honest tax concept and also 2 + 2 = 5!
a pinch of tax increase per interview - for the one additional burden of the big earners - for others higher VAT doesn&#39;t matter!
The Union&#39;s election program is an attempt to sell the electorate for stupid: a bit of a tax cut for some - sometime - for others
@sigiberlin federal law applies nationwide!
@Tim_HL the Styrian pack program of the Union: That&#39;s why Merkel has canceled the party congress: fear that voters will recognize this shoe!
@ Operating climate only adaptation to applicable federal law - no substantial new state law!
"@sigiberlin Federal law also applies in SH, Kubicki &amp; Co. actually know. At least until Karlsruhe decides otherwise."
"Return from the Steinburger Echofest in Eichede, interested friendly encounters, nice atmosphere, in the evening at the end of the Kiel Week."
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music: &quot;In the summertime&quot; by Mungo Jerry. Happy Sunday everyone! Breakfast sandwiches and Sundays. fetched.
Nice birthday party with Willi Voigt in Ellerbek.
Too bad is also a rather tragic story. I don&#39;t like style! # Ssp09stegner
"No - always just a supplement, but it makes sense and can be expanded! # Ssp09stegner"
"No, fight child pornography consistently but also efficiently. Delete instead of block.No other special application law # ssp09stegner"

Big birthday party for my wife yesterday in Salzau. Fun aside: Great Kiel Week reception in Salzau with dream weather and summer backdrop!
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Leonard Cohen &quot;Bird on the wire&quot;. Happy Thursday everyone!
"That has to be the new conservative North Frisian dialectic: Today like this, tomorrow different: spend a 180 degree turn as a consistent course! Agile!"
@Stecki Falling over after pressure to call your own decision is almost touching: your own decision as it was when you were promoting students ?!
@bueti that is simple: they are not a unitary party and on this one point the North SPD does not share the opinion of Environment Minister Gabriel
"CCS law off the table. Good for the people in SH.Nord SPD had put pressure, Union at odds, but CDU chairman PHC had already given in!"
After press talks and employee rounds briefly at home and then with my wife to the Kiel Week reception in Salzau.
@fdrohsel Welcome to SH!
@seereuber Constant repetition does not make the claim more correct! Election hopes of small parties legitimate but please without moral pathos
"insists, disturbs. Those who give in to black and yellow demands are praised, others claim it to have a dispute in the SPD. Triumph is premature!"
"black and yellow majorities, whoever is based on social democratic principles such as participation, equality or free education"
"Tonight Kiel Week reception in Salzau.Unfriendly press in this day shows that the majority are on break, early elections and"
"After the unanimous nomination yesterday in my state constituency conference, now with new momentum in the last weeks before the holidays."
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music &quot;You&#39;re the one&quot; by Elton John this time in private for my birthday child at home! Nice Wednesday!
"In the event of rejection of company-related layoffs, when entering the police, judiciary and teaching positions and also when no to daycare and studies"
"Harvest media criticism because of my supposedly too rigid stance in KOA negotiations. That&#39;s right: with participation, equality, daycare standards"
@conum greeting back!
Switching conference of the SPD committees then to Berlin for #AnneWill 9.45pm ARD Topic: pension.
but also no brake in the state constitution. Hard austerity decisions but social sense of proportion thanks to the SPD. Union&#39;s new election theater off the table!
Moin from SH.#@tweet_music today: Peter Cornelius &quot;The coffee is ready&quot;. Nice start to the week everyone!
SPD election campaign topic like freedom from tuition fees! No cancellations! No privatization savings banks! Debt brake is not complained about
"Fluctuation.School, enforcement with police and judiciary is not affected! Codetermination, day care standards, equality remain, non-contribution day care"
KOA committee ended. Difficult negotiations + sustainable results for SH.Pakt for jobs + budget consolidation
"Now the sun is there: on the way to the KOA round in Kiel, in the morning press about the situation in SH and especially the SPD, more poetry than truth!"
Moin from SH.Summer beginning shows cool and covered - today KOA negotiations in Kiel.#@tweet_ music: &quot;We can work it out&quot; by the Beatles.
Then whether the reds are offside or maybe not the black-yellow!
"By the way: from 15 years of experience as a football referee, I know that the referee is offside and inSH he whistles on 9/5/2010"
@Truck__Driver is right!
@Stecki the blacks say that regularly - but always only the wish is black and yellow father of thought! Reality is different!
@seereuber what a blooming nonsense! the article could be more about the Hamburg Greens # coal policy + tuition fees!
@Stecki am always fascinated by how competition can get intoxicated with wishful thinking! You have to get up much earlier!
Let&#39;s go to the opening of the Kiel Week! April weather on the Foerde.
"RT @AngieDor: RT @zitate First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win. * Mahatma Gandhi *"
@patrickziebke usual propaganda and black duck!
Immediately after Kiel for the final preparations for tomorrow&#39;s KOA round. Tonight for the opening of the Kiel Week - finally again by red OB!
@seereuber You shouldn&#39;t confuse us with the Hamburg Greens # study fees + coal policy
Moin from SH.Frueh on the way to the market and get bread for the family.#@tweet_music today: CCR &quot;Sweet hitch hiker&quot;.
"RT @ Luisa4Europe: Result election: 289 votes, 5 abstentions, 84 no, 200 yes. Congratulation!"
@anachorete doesn&#39;t!
Thank you for travelling with Deutsche Bahn....
"@seereuber True, but such an attitude does not come from me - read carefully ?!"
"Nobody claims that the press is unprofessional overall, but examples of it are easy to find. Some prefer prejudices!"
Political responsibility means concentrating on the matter and we are doing it. Everything else is unsightly but also unimportant!
"Some &quot;observers&quot; would obviously prefer to be political actors or wear their blinders with pride, even though they are actually for horses."
The aim is to create unrest and torpedo negotiations. Haeme and personal degradation are always there
Rain trip to Kiel. Again Landtag. Morning reading shows once again: Anonymous sources from internal meetings partly fictitious or

Moin from SH.#@tweet_ Music today: Bob Dylan &quot;Knockin &#39;on heaven&#39;s door&quot;. Nice Wednesday!

Discussion here partly without fairness for diversity of opinion. Assume malicious intentions or stupidity just because you don&#39;t have all the arguments
sensitive political issue.SPD for effective child protection and against the establishment of an Internet censorship structure! Both important! No playing out!
Extreme positions in the fight against child pornography are politically unsustainable - since it is not a virtual seminar discussion but

The exaggerated consumption of alcohol is rather different. The JU colleagues who were excited about the # fake-tweet were too early!
