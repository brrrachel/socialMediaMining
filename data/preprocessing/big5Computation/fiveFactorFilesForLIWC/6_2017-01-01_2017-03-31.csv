The CDU should tell people which course they actually want. The Merkel / Tauber course. Or the Seehofer / Spahn course?
In the newspapers today: Many party enthusiasts tell Ms. Merkel today what she has to do better. Good mood at the Union!
otherwise also 😇
don&#39;t tweet tweat :)
We chose a new party leadership yesterday. Many in the CDU would also like to do that.
only machines work for me!
you mean my office.

not correct. Secret choice. @tj_tweets @MartinSchulz

education? we would like to abolish the ban on cooperation. something has to happen in education. CDU blocked.
"poverty in old age, education fees, social housing - there is something to come. Merkel closes her eyes."
The CDU people in my timeline are all tweeting against Schulz. I would say that the nervousness increases ...
that was not my question...
what major domestic political reform is associated with the name Merkel?
Merkel has been chancellor for ages. That means style and sitting out. Not enough anymore. Country has to move forward!
"CDU increasingly nervous. The dirt campaigns should start soon. Let it ricochet off, further focus on justice. #zeitfuermartin #spd"
kremlin monster # solid and fluffy
in the morning in a taxi: listening to full volume hits. can a Sunday start better?
No.
"too much content for the CDU, I know;)"
With pleasure.
No.
Are you now a CDU?

"some online in the federal government, others on paper form in the local club."
"???? Yes, but they do not yet know who entered the structure. So there will be more than 200 people. That&#39;s why."
yes yes there are those who enter the federal party and others just at district associations etc.
during the speech by @MartinSchulz over 200 new entrants at the federal level. a candidate who craves politics! http://eintreten.spd.de
"There @soerenbartol, the @MartinSchulz and me. #zeitfuermartin pic.twitter.com/TCg4hzliKL"

"do not know if the foreign minister hits trump. but yes, expect my government to criticize it very clearly"
as chancellor did he make phone calls with Trump today and stage it? did not get it...
