Right now it is crucial for Germany and the EU to set the framework for strengthening our economic and industrial foundations. Our prosperity and social security depend on how successful our economy is in the world.
Unity and cohesion through equivalent living conditions across Germany - for this we need a strong and capable state that offers social security and enforces rules. Closed meeting of the East German MPs @cducsubt. https://www.cdu.de/mauerfall30 pic.twitter.com/UBRcwaAds0

@Der_BDI invited me to discuss the challenges for üá©üá™ and #UnserEuropa. One thing is clear: #Europe is at a crossroads. We must not become someone else&#39;s game ball. Europe itself has to be strong. As #CDU we stand for prosperity and security.

And!
No state can be made without women. Women won the right to vote 100 years ago. This is an obligation to get involved and participate. One possibility: http://www.cdu.de/ members- become # 100years women suffrage
And an ambitious climate protection law in particular needs broad social acceptance. And that can be achieved with a convincing overall approach and decisions that are based on facts and understandable considerations of different interests.
(2/2) Need intelligent overall concepts instead of hasty definition of individual measures #tempolimit
"(1/2) #Climate protection safeguards the future and is a major challenge for Germany as an industrial country. The balance is difficult. For @CDU, politics for climate protection and a strong economy is therefore a focus of work in 2019."

"Before # CDUklausur2019 in Potsdam, meeting with volunteers, including the auxiliary services at the CDU reception in Brandenburg / Havel I am thinking especially of all the helpers who are deployed in the snow areas and of the firefighters who died in Paris yesterday."
"You don&#39;t have to make things more complicated than they are, so you can find them here at @akk #Servicetweet instead of @_A_K_K_"
The current forecasts for lower economic growth in the Eurozone and Germany show that economic success is not a matter of course. Competitiveness has to be constantly re-worked.
Hope you got back home with a bearable tailwind.
"#Rents decrease when more apartments are built. # R2G in #Berlin shows what it&#39;s like when ideology prevails instead of reason.

"Right, @frank_thelen @dieteruhr. Germany is the country of inventors and thinkers. Instead of bans, we need courage, ingenuity and innovation. This enables us to do both: preserving creation and sustainable management. We as CDU have to take it to heart again."
Congratulations @ TKuban96 and all the best! Looking forward to fire from the @Junge_Union and the joint election campaign for #unserEuropa!
"Dear @ABaerbock, as a Saarlander from the heart of Europe, no one needs to explain Schengen with all its advantages. Nevertheless, the fact remains that fighting against criminals in the Schengen area too often comes up against state / authority boundaries. # EP2019 good opportunity to change that."

"@Peteraltmaier&#39;s thoughts on strategic industrial policy are important food for thought. Europe must not only be the recipient of strategic decisions by third parties, such as China and the USA. As Europe itself, we have to be strong to help shape the global rules."
"With #Grundrente the following must also apply: performance must pay off! The concept presented goes far beyond the coalition agreement and does not reflect discussions with countries.

Today I was a guest on the board of @MIT_bund. We talked about how we can keep Germany fit for the future in a changed environment. We use the # revision clause in the coalition agreement and will make our own suggestions.

It is very unfortunate that the USA formally terminate the # INF contract. Russia has unfortunately not dispelled doubts about contractual compliance. Now #USA and #Russia have to use the six month period to negotiate an INF follow-up agreement. 1.2
