@jelmeruit I will be talking to Henk Kamp in a few months&#39; time. Interest in the Netherlands is growing and there are starting points
"35 years ago in Sittard, I was impressed by NL language and culture. That was one of the best decisions I have ever made"
CDA Netherlands and CDU Germany set up an annual meeting years ago that takes place every spring in Limburg
Perhaps today&#39;s meeting is the reason for a greater focus on DE / NL subject developments
Today&#39;s German / Dutch meeting is the culmination of years of close cooperation at almost all levels.
Governments of the Netherlands / Germany meet today for joint consultations. Already looking forward to meeting colleagues and friends!
@larsklingbeil I&#39;m looking forward to it! Hold on so that you can still experience it! ;-)
I congratulate the SPD on its 150th birthday! She did a lot right in the past! That&#39;s why you can&#39;t really be angry with her today!
@Haetscher :-))
@einmalteduerr @larsklingbeil @mathiasrichel we didn&#39;t have it then. And our Uropa Adenauer was persecuted by the Nazis!
@Haetscher I know you from my early phase on Twitter! You are certainly also a founding member of the SPD !!!
@Ralf_Stegner :-)) for now!
"@concilium yes, I do that all the time: aces, repositories, PV, electricity price brakes"
I was just reminded at MoMa that I have been in office for exactly 1 year today. Thanks to all of you for your huge interest and support!
@ mib303 elections are always and somewhere! I have been skeptical about fracking since I became Minister of the Environment
Shortly after 7 a.m. I am at the MoMa and will explain why fracking in D should not take place in the foreseeable future
"@Stefan_Beckmann Yes, that&#39;s it! But it&#39;s not easy in the job!"
@padmodi Are you still there too? They remind me of my beginnings on Twitter in the distant past! Good night!
"At MdB Peter Aumer in Wiesent, I discussed the energy transition with around 400 listeners: It was great and fun!"
My visit to the Mally monkey at the Munich animal shelter was a signal that animal protection should not be neglected despite the energy transition and repository
"Now get me off the field. With the CO2-free parcel delivery in Bonn, we have made history today and advanced e-mobility"
"@dpomondi If so, why did everyone want us to extend it and start a new commitment period?"
"@JochenFlasbarth @dpomondi Even if many are pssimistic: Something is happening, especially in China."
@JochenFlasbarth @dpomondi It would have been better if we had something better than Kyoto. But it was much better than nothing!
"@Hermann_Ott @DJanecek As a minister, I am committed to truthful representations! :-)"
"@FalkJan @DJanecek Where you are right, you are right!"
"@sixtus No, but we only extended the runtimes, didn&#39;t even want to build new nuclear power plants!"
@dpomondi Gladly: Kyoto was the first u only binding agreement so far and the icebergs helped change consciousness!
"@FalkJan @DJanecek Unfortunately wrong. When entering the EE, CDU / CSU with Peter Harry Carstensen and Dietrich Austermann were among the front runners!"
"@Ralf_Stegner You are confusing something: the feed-in priority is in the law and applies, but the EE must be sold on the stock exchange"
@UlrichKelber at least you now admit that price increases threaten. You contested that last year!
@UlrichKelber Yes. You cannot sell EE electricity 1 year in advance because you do not know whether the sun will shine or the wind will blow.
"@ Zoido4Design If there is a lot of EE electricity at the weekend but nobody needs it, it will be &quot;sold out&quot;. Would be different if there were storage."
"@UlrichKelber Unfortunately, even I cannot change the principle that the less there is for a product, the more of it there is. And vice versa"
"@YoungSocialist @ulrichkelber There is the Leprich proposal, but - as far as I can see - no party has yet adopted it."
". @ UlrichKelber There is no working proposal for this - not even from the SPD. If you had one, the SPD could decide it"
@ mapro67 @ peterw69 what? Renewable energy grants will be subsidized this year with € 20 billion - and that&#39;s just the feed-in tariff
"@ mapro67 why? If you cut VAT for electricity to 7.5%, the loss of revenue would be many times greater than the additional revenue."
"@wfmokadd @SPIEGELONLINE Sure, only that the tax losses would be much higher - then you would have to cut spending quite a bit"
@wfmokadd @spiegelonline It cannot be reduced for electricity as there can only be 2 different VAT rates per country.
@ SPIEGELONLINE could not be explained in detail!
@SPIEGELONLINE go. The additional income from VAT will benefit the federal government and the federal states together. That is the background of today&#39;s show
@SPIEGELONLINE Tax revenue for VAT due to increased EEG surcharge. Because VAT cannot be reduced. Is that about electricity tax
@SPIEGELONLINE No problem! But your mistake in the fact check was annoying: SPD always bases funding after a reduction in electricity tax with ./2
@siegstyle Genial! Wow!
@ChristelBlanke @gabikostorz the 4 groups have to decide by consensus!
@UdoSieverding we are never late! 11:00 was clear because there is a cabinet beforehand! #Termineffizienz!
@ AndreWeber1988 wears a halo on the POV !!!
@jpdalloz @ministere_dd @fil_gouv @delphinebatho with always renewable energy!
"“Very great: @KonstantinNotz: We have a current hour this week, which means @peteraltmaier without @” Thanks for the flowers!"
@spdbt :-))
I would like to thank @spdbt for giving me the opportunity on Thursday to present my successful work in Parliament!
@rainerhunold Thank you: Finally someone who encourages me! :-)
"@rolandtheis Neub, I&#39;m a restaurant tester! :-)"
"@LongoFL I replied more often because I thought we could discuss. But they agitate. Which is your right, by the way."
@RamaLamaDing_ Did you know that somebody will get it out! :-)
@ WolfLorenz I was afraid! :-)
"@tmmd Yes, really true! But now there are more and more ..."
Now get me off the field. Sometimes ask me who will follow me when I am no longer a minister? Until the tweet separates you!
"@ simpsons3 MNo, but you may be faced with a state secret betrayal! :-)"
@ simpsons3 Only the initiates really know that! But word will still get around! :-)
Today students asked me if I was &quot;on TV&quot;. Yesterday someone asked if I was the Minister of Economy. Not too bad after all. :-)
@henkjanormel Congratulations! I think that&#39;s great!
@FragOMat :-))
"Gerd Langguth and Max Stadler weren&#39;t political stars, but they did a great job for our democracy - each in its own way!"
@henkjanormel Wart do you do in Rome? Andreotti&#39;s funeral? Future of Berlusconi? Sincerely! Peter
@MediterrNewsNet in what context?
Cordial meeting with @delphinebatho in Berlin: climate change and energy transition!
"@FrederikFatz I don&#39;t know, you have to ask Raphael Schäfer"
"@mverdonk I&#39;ve always been an advocate of backloading. If the EP takes a decision soon, the Council would decide in October"
@MKreutzfeldt There is no contradiction either: we both want emissions trading to finally work again!
@ActiegroepGerman Maybe we can found an action group of Dutch in Germany!
"@Action groupGerman Congratulations on the #DagvandeGermany language! Furthermore, good luck!"
@kischorsch the energy transition more than deserves the name! No big industrial country is as far as we are!
"@AreaUlli yes, the show goes off like a rocket! :-))"
@MarcoHoe but I just didn&#39;t have time because I have to fight for the climate!
"@MarcoHoe Politicians don&#39;t like to change, just think of the yellow sweater by Genscher or the red scarf by Momper! :-)"
"@ Chr83 will definitely be exciting, you shouldn&#39;t forget !!! :-)"
@DerAuenlaender :-))
"@Nico No, but maybe she&#39;ll do that soon with the SPD and the Greens! :-)"
"After the Federal Chancellor&#39;s clear commitment to climate protection, the working session has now begun."
@UdoSieverding You just always look out damn well!
"@tw_pipes You are absolutely right. At the moment, however, the media is not interested as long as the electricity price has not been clarified!"
@mpucher yawn !!! :-)
"@CoFi_juwi @longofl @ulrichkelber If you all agree once again, the world is completely in order !!!"
"@nixus_nrw @dave_kay maybe necessary, but it won&#39;t get caught in the long run!"
@RealPapsT @dave_kay ÖA is as important for politicians as PR for the company! But can never replace a good product! :-)
@ NicoBS78 Thanks! So far around 1000! I really wouldn&#39;t have thought that !!!
"The polar bear lives in the Arctic, by the way - but is considering emigrating to the Antarctic if it doesn&#39;t get colder!"

"@ Alexdjackson92 It was also a good audience! Since I was at the Fastelovend in Gürzenich, they have grown dear to my heart in Cologne!"
@ Alexdjackson92 were you in the audience? Otherwise you can&#39;t even know :-)
@angeliqueries Thank you. It was a nice event. But unfortunately little Twitter support! :-)
@ Doppelgeist60 I&#39;m excited too. He could be trusted - one way or the other
@ andie4leaders did I do that? I warned about it and gave a tip. Out of old connection! :-)
@SwScho from &quot;only&quot; was no question!

@ dhovekamp42 funding begins as planned in May
"@jelmeruit That is - unfortunately - so. However, I think it is important that I set the climatic centrall in the capacity of environment minister"
@Michael_Musto @ hauwech3 of course I don&#39;t follow as many as @Volker_Beck - but even then I almost can&#39;t read everything
@Groote I have always said that government will have a position as soon as there is something to negotiate with the EP.
"Anyone who tries to do party politics now, dear @Groote, harms ETS"
ETS-vote was serious setback for Climate Protection. We will have to encourage a public debate on the best  way to reduce CO2 emissions
Thank You to all of You who backed #backloading over the last weeks and months!
@GrueneNauheim if Wowereit desperately defends Steinbrück is it ok? If Altmaier defends Merkel is it a trail of slime?
@sneijderization Good to know! Then I have to make a real effort in the future !!!
@dagmarenkelmann You have just mistaken the aces for Gorleben! :-)

"@Gerdbillen @evelinelemke @ulrichkelber Agree, we have a responsibility towards consumers!"
Now we have the historical opportunity to make the repository search open and transparent!
"The way is finally clear for the repository search law! The agreement of the CDU / CSU, SPD, FDP, Greens and all 16 federal states is a great signal!"
@solarfalke I actually react to a lot of tweets - unfortunately I can&#39;t answer everyone
@Jaschensky @sz I thought so! :-)
"@U_Rieth thank you, I can use!"
@ PsychoTR0N Tweet is used against me!
"@ PsychoTR0N we are all getting older. As a minister, I regret to say that everyone"
Shortly after 7 a.m. in Moma to search for a repository. We can make a fresh start!

"@tknuewer And that you are accusing me of having a narrow world view that I have worked internationally all my life, ../2"
@DanielLuecking :-))
@tknuewer and if you like you can also compare the structure of my followers and the number of languages in my tweets with average users
@tknuewer if it reassures you: as far as working in foreign languages is concerned you can also compare me with eugopa politicians
"@tknuewer @janalbrecht and that different standards have to be applied to federal, European and local politicians ..."
@tknuewer @janalbrecht You need a standard for every assessment.
"@JanAlbrecht @tknuewer clever heads! Do you know any federal politician who tweets more in EN, NL, FR than I do? :-)"
"@dpomondi yes, this is the case with these regulations. in the case of laws, the VA can even be called if they do not require approval"
"I have many followers from NL, EN, FR and tweet in these languages. But it is not yet a real international public debate"
@dpomondi through the cabinet? Yes of course.
"Now get me off the field. Tomorrow again repositories, electricity price brakes and compensation regulation. But today was nice. Read you!"
"@ JuliaLange82 Sure, but the debates are mostly national!"
"Did you notice that this debate can only be international? This is missing: Twitter is national, but the network is international!"

@powerphil you are right! Was a typo
"@sybrandbuma When A. Merkel was opposition leader, she was already impressed by the Netherlands. Thanks to the friends of the CDA!"
Das was a relaxed meeting with Dutch colleagues and then a stylish transfer of honorary doctorate to the Federal Chancellor
"@sundrio I tweet myself and I speak myself :-) at least as long as it is about Dutch, French and English!"
"Despite the existing very close cooperation, the meeting is especially useful for German colleagues because we have a lot of experience in the Netherlands"
"After the bilateral discussions and the &#39;family photo&#39;, now the plenary session"
@ MansveldWilma and the Dutch delegation have just arrived. Everyone is now looking forward to a good conversation and a delicious lunch!

"@ wiesel250482 that&#39;s right. However, there are Ewa number of schools - especially in the border regions - where that possibility already exists!"
I am very much looking forward to the bilateral discussions with @MansveldWilma and Henk Kamp about the environment and energy!
"@haastrecht Yes, and your name seems to me to be at least Flemish!"
@H_Luebbers first the repository search law will be passed
@H_Luebbers In principle yes. But now must first
"By the way, I&#39;m mostly concentrated!"
@i_hob I do that intensely. Would have been better if Kickin &amp; Gabriel had started!

"@PiratMatt There you have a point. But there are also pets that can hardly survive without humans, such as dogs"
@Laberlohe @DJanecek The point goes to you!
@DubaiHeuer :-))
"@BeowulfOF It is important that the tweet is understood. And it will be great, as the reactions show! :-)"
". @ DJanecek With Kyoto and the icebergs, Angela Merkel has done 100x more for climate protection than 11 years of red / green environment ministers!"

@felixmatthes @ulrichkelber for those who need electricity when it is cheap.
"@felixmatthes @ulrichkelber The problem is that falling spot market prices do not reach consumers equally, but only"
@alemkra to me too! :-)
"@UlrichKelber Yes, my suggestions amount to up to 3 billion. Including cut for energy intensive!"
. @ UlrichKelber Your argument is as follows: it is a mistake that water only flows down the mountain and not up. Altmaier has to change that!
@UlrichKelber But that only occurred to you after I raised the alarm in January. In the fall there was no talk of you!
@UlrichKelber such nonsense: the legal framework has changed since then and you rejected my suggestions!
"@GabiKostorz in that point I was referring to St Wenzel, who wants to push back 2031. That was not agreed"
@ tweetanno20xx The electricity price brake comes because prices keep rising. Red / Green is responsible for this.
"@GabiKostorz Yes, sometimes it is necessary! :-)"
"@NewelMedia That is the job of the media. In the end, they make a short message that, contrary to expectations, it worked.! :-)"
@aabaco @DLF I really don&#39;t know. I only know that we have a responsibility to try.

@GabiKostorz I am so relaxed that I was still in the Cafe Schleusenkrug with my bike this evening! :-)
@bibergockel Good politics just pays off!
@Rotwand In principle you are right!
@GabiKostorz He brought in the bill. There are some things he doesn&#39;t like. Nds also want changes and you will see what is capable of consensus.
"@ aotto1968_2 For our country. So far, the question of the repository has split deeply, preventing a solution."
"@LucasGerrits In some cases we have made exceptions, in which case the question did not arise. :-)"
@fail_md Can be a few years earlier. depends on whether we get the parties to agree.
"@_korsa No, just not, but you should act together on important questions."
@MatthiasBF Exactly. But I think we can do it even faster than some countries that continue to rely on nuclear energy
@LucasGerrits Because @dieLinke was never interested in our discussions and never asked for participation.
"It was a good day because the CDU / CSU, SPD, FDP and the Greens jointly introduced the draft law for the repository search law."
"At the repository, there is now a very high level of agreement between the groups. Some still have difficulty admitting this. :-)"

@UdoSieverding Not quite this time! :-)
@teamdeutschland @jurischnoeller then we want to make an effort! :-)
@untertannen On the contrary: work will continue at high pressure until summer!
Why do my MPs from the SPD and Greens not dare to publicly admit how well we work together
"@UdoSieverding it is very clear who is blocking, and you have to contact them!"
"Most importantly, the environment and energy are back on the political agenda! Incidentally, the balance is only complete in summer"
"Many regulations, agreements with business and associations on green economy, biodiversity energy efficiency and energy saving. ../2"
"Some are already talking about my &quot;political balance sheet&quot;: It is already super good with 3 big laws (PV, aces, repository), ../2"

"@stefanolix Since the campaign was not announced to me beforehand, I was unfortunately unable to prepare for the tie!"
Thanks to @greenpeace_de for the action of this morning! With all differences in detail: climate protection pays more attention!
@UlrichKelber the CDU supports the admission in Schleswig-Holstein! From the opposition. The SPD and the Greens were nowhere like state theaters!
@JuliusBetschka :-))
@UlrichKelber Lower Saxony has taken on all castors for years with CDU participation. Elsewhere it also depends on our SPD partner
@UlrichKelber Everything wrong! Nothing was withdrawn from me and I am definitely not ranked below!

"@adiiSanFran everything in order: I want to save the energy turnaround, the SPD has to see for itself how it can cope ... :-))"
"Should @peersteinbrueck speak as before, it would be better for the SPD than if he tried to overtake the Left Party on the left."
"@Groote but if I advertise backloading, don&#39;t complain. :-)"
"The problem is not @peersteinbrueck, but that the SPD is imposing a program on him that he cannot credibly represent."
"@Markbaju Too bad, I thought you could discuss them objectively. Then it&#39;s not possible :-("
"@Markbaju the patient, however, is not the energy transition but the national economy. I have clearly said that x times."
"@Markbaju Well, well, if I thought of elections, I would talk to people by mouth. I prefer to corner because I want to design"
@UdoSieverding :-)
"@UdoSieverding by the way: it is not the energy transition that is being operated, but the national economy!"
@UdoSieverding am curious how many bypasses are necessary! :-)
@florianmerker I knew that I would find the solution to the energy transition here! :-)
@SIMON_BUCK Who would have thought that! :-)
@SanguisDraconis ready! :-)
@hoegertn at KfW from May 1st
@UlrichKelber @andrebetz the surgeon focuses on the actual findings during the operation and not on preconceived ideology
@UdoSieverding @andrebetz the chief surgeon! You know who that is ?!
@ meikel40474 You rarely see me there because the tables are very narrow. My sonorous voice is understood in the whole hall!
@hxsch @ broadcast :-)
@jacobfricke_me Rightly! Honor to whom honor is due. This way the reader can understand the dialogue and form his opinion!
@exposed You really prepared it very nicely and excitingly: that&#39;s how I imagine Twitter 2.0!
"Well, the good first / then sayings are probably through now. Thank you! Whatever it will be tomorrow - we should keep talking constructively!"
"@Jochen_Stay @ broadcast I want everyone to find each other in the end, only then. That&#39;s why I approached Nds, Wenzel u Weil"
"@ aired Yes, but there is no parliamentary majority for this without the law!"
"@ aired no law without law, no law without law. This is squaring the circle but with Altmaier / Weil / Wenzel it works."
@ aired out. I have not yet been able to offer an inquiry and stop for the castors. I am convinced that the majority will support it!
@ aired During my visit to Wendland I discussed openly and honestly with 500 people. What has been achieved now goes beyond this
Nice idea with the &quot;first-then&quot; examples. But we have to forge the iron while it&#39;s hot! instead of: either / or: both as well!
@fredo_ffm @KonstantinNotz @ Kyra2001 @AliCologne And how. But Greens feel bogged down with pirates: they always want to missionize you
@SabineAussenac @ArLeparmentier But man is man because he is not God! :-)
"@ArLeparmentier If God would be dead, the responsibility would be ours! Nothing would be allowed except humanity!"
@ saschaz3 So it is! :-)
@elkebergsma @udosieverding @honourstone @profkemfert because the amount is on the order of 5 or 6 less
@UdoSieverding @honourstone @profkemfert I suspected that at least one person knows his way around! :-)
@Honourstone @profkemfert unfortunately it is claimed again and again - since Trittin - and wash water the acceptance of the energy transition
@mhlsteinbrck you need it too. Do not know if you would find the direction alone! :-)
@MaxBreitenbach sometimes when I have free time and want to relax. Also happy to use bikes on duty! :-)
Now back in Berlin after 7 hours at the wheel. Thanks for support and factual debate in the meantime!
"@forenwanderer you mean the one from Hanover? I voted against it at the time, but a majority voted in favor. #democracy"
"@julianeleopold No, for me, conscience was in 90n criminal liability for rape in the before and before abolition paragraph 176"
@ danielm2601 can you imagine that the connection b &quot;was unknown to me since I have been concentrating on the energy transition for months?
"@julianeleopold I voted yes at the party conference, but at BT I always vote with my parliamentary group - except for real questions of conscience"
Ignite deviating position immediately a shitstorm
"You cast a vote at the top and a certain measure comes out at the bottom. Incidentally, I also meant the intolerance of those with everyone"
"Tax reduction, prevention of individual projects (S21) or fulfillment of specific demands. Popular parties are not machines with them"
"These are press groups that usually make their approval of a party dependent on a single question, regardless of whether"
By &#39;shrill individual interests&#39; I mean those who see politics only from the point of view of personal concern and interests
This is known and I therefore ask you to refrain from assumptions for which there is no indication.
On the contrary: For 20 years I have been working here to overcome gaps and discrimination.
"Anyone who assumes that I meant &#39;shrill individual interests&#39;, for example, same-sex partnerships, is completely wrong."
"I&#39;ve been in politics for 20 years, whether it&#39;s women&#39;s rights, same-sex coexistence or integration."
(2) This includes social and legal emancipation for all individuals and groups that have been discriminated against in the past
"To clarify: In Interview- @ welt I warned against the election campaign. For me, CDU is the big popular party of bourgeois modernism"
@ThomasWalde I am unmistakable! What was meant was: we do not make policies &quot;on demand&quot;. I see CDU as a party of bourgeois modernism!
@Honourstone @profkemfert Not a single golf course has ever been exempt from the EEG levy.
@Honourstone It has been clarified x times: I am right. @ProfKemfert confuses this with the much lower network charges.
@Synelly&#39;s economic and social policies - we were pretty much the same with the rest!
Otmar Schreiner was my opponent in the constituency for 18 years. We argued and valued each other. He was a strong piece of the SPD. Thank you.
@ Zoido4Design No problem! Bye for now!
@ Zoido4Design Then I&#39;m reassured! :-)
@ Zoido4Design was that just the comparison of a certain politician with Nero?
"For those who have not yet understood it: Fracking does not allow anything that was forbidden, but forbids a lot that was previously allowed"
The exzellent chairmanship of @MedvedevRussiaE has made the Baltic Sea Summit a great encouragement for better Environment Protection!
@WinnieKretsche I like to travel by train very often - but that wasn&#39;t possible here
"It&#39;s been a while since @AHaardt, but I would be happy to answer if possible."
"@FDimroth @photovoltaik what should it look like? I had already proposed a European consortium in the summer, but hesitated for companies"
@FDimroth @photovoltaik They are not either. But the losses arose despite 3 years of expansion in Germany
@christiansoeder @ danielm2601 @ migrate89 That&#39;s right. It certainly helped that many helped via tweets and blogs. Thanks for that!
@mhlsteinbrck Then I&#39;m reassured. You will surely do the rest!
"@Aliwaise Generally yes, but someone had also put a small egg in my nest! Like this!"
"@MMCBXX Mostly not (except bike), but today it was 747 km!"
@martin_im_web Every now and then you have to make sure that you haven&#39;t taken off yet! :-)
@FloMhr Thank you!
@wastlde @dorobaer @ludwigr @piratenpartei @sekor You have misunderstood something: the pirate party has turned over to me!
"Exciting debate about my proposal. Unfortunately not everyone can answer, but will write articles soon"
