"We join in! Congratulations, dear @KerstinGriese! 🥳🍾☀️💐"
. @ NowaboFM: Racial discrimination is a fact in Germany. And in every individual case a violation of our country&#39;s values. One thing is clear: we face all enemies of a free society! # SPDbpt19
". @ NowaboFM: I know how to do that. I already did it. We recovered EUR 7 billion from tax criminals in NRW. For schools, day care centers, police and hospitals. # SPDbpt19 #NeueZeit"
. @ NowaboFM: High fortunes and inheritance of millions must finally make an appropriate contribution to the financing of our community. Tax fraud and money laundering must be combated massively! #NeueZeit # SPDbpt19
". @ NowaboFM: Against Internet corporations that set the limits of our privacy, defy workers rights, form monopolies and trample tax liability only a strong Europe helps! # SPDbpt19 #NeueZeit"

". @ EskenSaskia: In the #new times, that means to be brave! We have been more of a grand coalition than an independent political force in recent years. I say: Anyone who is afraid of annoying even a single voter will not inspire a single one. # SPDbpt19"
". @ EskenSaskia: #Respektrente is the word of the year - rightly so! Because behind it is the # basic pension. If @akk now tries to take the basic pension hostage for our remaining in the grand coalition, then that is disrespectful! # SPDbpt19 #NeueZeit"

"Men and women who have worked long, 35 years and more, who have raised children or have cared for relatives, receive a pension at the end of their working hours that rewards their lifetime achievement. The # basic pension compromise is really a milestone in social policy."
There is a technical income check without people having to fully disclose their circumstances. We make the basic pension close to the citizen and unbureaucratic. That goes through the cooperation between pension insurance and financial administration. That was important to the SPD.
"We enable between 1.2 and 1.5 million people to receive the # basic pension from January 1, 2021. Women in particular will use this basic pension: four out of five recipients will be women. This is also a strong signal for women’s politics."
Malu Dreyer: The # basic pension is a socio-political milestone. It was important for us as social democrats that people who worked long hours receive a pension that is above basic security. And that they don&#39;t have to go to an office as supplicants. pic.twitter.com/eQJq4KeQe9

"This is a figure skating duo and are not available to choose from. Incidentally, it is not about a top candidate, but about the SPD party chair. But you probably don&#39;t care anyway."
"Dear @synapsenblock, have you watched just one of our tour events and listened to the candidates? PS a duo is definitely chosen, so it won&#39;t be a pure &#39;he&#39; anyway 😉"
And so you can vote on our new chair Brief #UnsereSPD pic.twitter.com/vkAji6crrH

"Of course, this evening was different. Anti-Semitic violence, the murder of two people on the highest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, hits us all deeply. We&#39;ll talk about it tonight. And don&#39;t forget for a second what happened."
7 couples apply for the party leadership of the SPD. @Rnd_de rolls out the red carpet - but not for all candidates. Only women have their say today! We are very much looking forward to this unusual evening! Live stream from 6.30pm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YY-kQNUth8…

Agenda item Streetcred is noted.
Ps: Do you still say &quot;StreetCred&quot;?
Apart from that: the text by @SPIEGELONLINE is actually about communities. Official party accounts have little street credit anyway. It is better to find personal videos such as those from @woelken or @KuehniKev: ▶ ️ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPj-O6kDjNyPbcuEHaODS2A… ▶ ️ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaGyQSEOx9gieNjXQVHtU4PnoDN…
