Did you put crosses up there?
Do you play?
&quot;The CSU is terrified of the state election and is ready to give up successful principles of decades of German politics for a few AfD votes. That leaves you stunned. “Https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/die-csu-hat-blanke-panik-spd-general-klingbeil-rechnet-im-asylstreit-ab_de_5b24aedbe4b056b2263a3858…

The interesting thing about my job? Some days are really different than you think.
"You want a different refugee policy. I want authorities, procedures and integration to work. That distinguishes us both, right."
Negotiations for months. Always with our responsibility for a strong Europe in mind. Now there is government and the CSU is causing such a mess after just a few weeks because of the state election? Even if the men act like this: The CSU is not the center of the world.

"During your research, you will find that the SPD has repeatedly given advice on how to better equip the Bamf. In the end, it was SPD ministers like @borispistorius who only disclosed the whole thing."
Seehofer says it was the CDU. Altmaier says it was de Maiziere. And the Chancellor says nothing. That will not do. The necessary information is different! http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/bamf-affaere-altmaier-weise-verantwortung-von-sich-15617773.html…
