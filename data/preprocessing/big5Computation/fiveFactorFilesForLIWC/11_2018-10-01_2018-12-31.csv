Clarify us. What completely different purposes are we pursuing? (TB)
There are good reasons to force people to use garbage disposal. You cannot force them to actually use public service broadcasting. (TB)

"Oh, thank you for the compliment."

"The demand for a higher broadcasting fee is immeasurable.

That&#39;s not true. https://www.co2online.de/klima-schuetzen/mobilitaet/auto-co2-ausstoss/‚Ä¶ (TB)
The problem is deeper: the discussion about broadcasting fees is very difficult to win from a constitutional and political point of view because of the funding guarantee. A content discussion as well because of the freedom of programming. Structures as well. Self-government. But number of channels - that&#39;s political. (TB)
"However, it says that structural reform should lead to a significant reduction in broadcasting fees. (TB)"
