Very cheap # left again. Don&#39;t always infer yourself from others!
"What kind of sick fantasies you have, well, fits your previous appearance here."
Why should I?
"we would have no problem with that, on the contrary"
"You can connect necessary paths with it, that&#39;s how I do it."

"And you trivialize National Socialism again, right? #Nazikeulenschwinger"
"yes, but flying from vocational school goes too far"
"Stupid chatter on the left. If it is a criminal offense, the public prosecutor has to clarify this, but to deny the start of work and economic existence is more reminiscent of red dictatorships."
"the prosecution saw it differently, but of course you know better"
"In his speech in the state parliament, Lippmann (#Linke) points out that politically wrong actions - such as showing Hitler&#39;s salute - should cause vocational students to fly out of school. I spoke against it as a long-time instructor, because something just goes too far! #ADPM"

"Oh, all European EU critics are Nazis? How stupid left can do ..."
"For the East Germans, a result of up to 30% is emerging for right-wing parties to vote in the EU. The new federal states thus correspond to the EU-critical trend in Europe, whereas in West Germany it was not recognized that the EU is only a business model. #ADPM 🇩🇪"
that is not a contradiction! peaceful Europe of the fatherlands

"Of course for the GG and its compliance, also in Leipzig-Connewitz."
"Comrade Poggenburg thinks that Art. 4 is very good, only the left-wing misinterpretation, which, for example, grants freedom of Islam and approves the violation of other articles and §§. As far as understood? Link ideologists often have difficulty understanding this way."

Completely unqualified comment! Just because you reasonably reject and criticize something has nothing to do with &quot;hate&quot;. Their verbal failure is the real problem in political discourse.
"Are the new left Islam lovers actually insane? The article takes up the razor-sharp paradox of new left-wing world improvers and their love for Islam, which is hostile to women and gays.

And you think you know what a society should tolerate? Are you such an intolerant preacher of tolerance?
Yes and what do you want with the saying on my side? Where and when have I &quot;rushed&quot; in the name of Christianity?
Terror series in the name of Islam with over 300 dead in Sri Lanka. Therefore clear &amp; clear: no Islam in Germany &amp; Europe! #ADPM
Why should I? Or are you such an intolerant preacher of tolerance?

"Always the same thing. If you are against multi-cultural madness and against the left, you are supposed to be the right-wing extremist and Nazi. # Links stupid"
Then what is this left-wing and misguided discussion about racism all about? So you just violate the statutes? 🤔
"Patriot and right-wing populist, everything else is left-wing mobbing and trivialization of National Socialism."
My party? What do you know about the #ADPM?
Why should I? Because a left-wing man like you is fooling around stupidly?

Where did I say that? Left-wing persecutor?
"MoMa #ARD: reports &amp; praises meeting with franz. National flags in front of Notre-Dame, the &quot;national pride&quot; and means - hardly imaginable in Germany. Right!
