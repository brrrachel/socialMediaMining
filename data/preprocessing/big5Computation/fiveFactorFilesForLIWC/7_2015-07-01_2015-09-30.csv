"@TheHumbleJosh however, the nice thing is that the clever one can act stupid - the reverse is forever denied to you ;-)"
Gillamoos (13) And only tolerated toll reports a la Bayernkurier And by the way a foolish affair - I only say bunga bunga parties
Gillamoos (12) Seehofer is pale in the Alpine competition with Berlusconi: he would have had the judges arrested after the care allowance ruling
Gillamoos (11) We must never surrender to the PEGIDIOTS or withdraw!
"Gillamoos 9 says and set penetrating fragrance brands. Now the cat is neutered: toll on ice, childcare allowance perdu - it smells less harsh"
"Gillamoos (8) CSU is like a frisky hangover: Angie maw heart-wrenching, claws out, if someone something for care money or toll"
Gillamoos (7) Heiner Geißler says: &quot;In Germany we have money like dirt - it is only with the wrong people.&quot; CDU man not communist!
"Gillamoos (6) The others have 100 years of FJS, we have 152 years of freedom, justice and solidarity!"
"Gillamoos (5) Modest as we are social partners I draw the conclusion here quickly And say how I see the thing, The good wins: The SPD!"
"Gilla..4 Arguing the speakers at Gillamoos Who can spread the most joke Who is a clever one, who is a stupid Stegner, Roth, Kubicki, Söder"
Gillamoos (3) scolds the Prussian CDU Franz-Josef looks at him from above He sucks: his Hermann and Blanco voices have to be a bit of fun
Gillamoos (2) Dobrindt? Söder? Aigner? -Mann Should I go back myself? Now he is drinking himself with a roar of battle The black comrades beautiful
"Gillamoos (1) Who stumbles there in the dark night, The Crazy Horst has messed up care coal - foreign toll that messed up the judiciary"
The reds had fun anyway! A somewhat different Gillamoos Monday - Abensberg - Middle Bavarian http://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/kelheim/gemeinden/abensberg/ein-etwas-anderer-gillamoosmontag-21078-art1279441.html…

@laszloriedl nothing there - Them &quot;Friday&#39;s child&quot; and the other also 😉
Funding the Union to cut scarce pocket money for refugees is totally wrong. Sentiment against refugees - not with the SPD!
"The individual asylum law cannot be touched. Procedures can be quicker, but please no regular table suggestions!"
"One can check not to redistribute refugees to municipalities who probably cannot stay here, but CSU harassment is unacceptable!"
"Rapid screening procedures for refugees are necessary, many people from the Balkans will not be able to stay here - no reason for harassment!"
"@kommoptimierer Them ""Friday's child"
"Weather forecast for today looks pretty good, overly long-term forecasts are going wrong these days ;-)"
"Later it goes to the Arche Wader, to the Eekholt zoo and to the sheep farmers in Blumenthal. Happy Friday everyone ;-)"
Good morning from Bordesholm. Last day of my summer trip through SH - this time about animal protection. First to the beekeepers in Bad Segeberg.

@Aye feast That was ironic
@jkorten Gauland is a miserable right-wing populist.
"@ Doppelgeist60 Well, well"
"@SturmDaniel @kahrs Very funny. Do not worry. SPD has been written off many times. It was never true, not with Dahrendorf and not otherwise."
"Torsten Albig agree on most questions - especially as far as SH politics is concerned, as far as Chancellor Merkel is concerned, Finis 2017!"
@MGrosseBroemer more intense than Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble when it comes to GREXIT?
@ Doppelgeist60 We are really super present on social networks 😉
"Citizen insurance, modern family, fair tax policy, good work, social security + consistent energy transition only with SPD leadership!"
"SPD does not want competition with Greens, who will become the Union&#39;s junior partner in 2017. Government dominance despite 25% already, goal remains Chancellery!"
"Of course, testing procedures need to be accelerated and municipalities better supported by the federal government when accommodating refugees."

@Chef_decuisine That&#39;s nonsense!
"Childcare provided by mothers and fathers is wonderful, but is no reason to discriminate against women and to deny them real freedom of choice."
The assertion that those who promote public childcare and demand real equality are against families is outrageous!
"No one wants to prescribe public childcare! But why privilege the opposite? Women for children, kitchen ...? Reactionary!"
"@HugoMuellerVogg I don&#39;t share that, but is it possible without ideology and preference for your own ideas? Real freedom of choice for everyone!"

The CSU&#39;s anti-inheritance tax fundamentalism is anti-social. Tax high assets fairly! Basic Law: Property Obliged!

@morgenmagazin How about the difference between real proposals that solve a problem and regulars&#39; table policy to create mood.
"@ walli5 @SZ The comment by Roland Preuss, who takes a critical look at Seehofer&#39;s right-wing populist refugee policy!"
There are too many perpetrators of violence who attack refugee accommodation and who may feel encouraged by verbal arsonists.
"On the other hand, no one needs ideas of deterrence from the regulars brothers Seehofer and Scheuer, who do not solve a single problem but fuel the mood."
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today the second day of my summer trip on the topic of &quot;animal protection&quot;. Appointments in Kiel at the State Conservation Association.

 https://www.facebook.com/handelsblatt/posts/10153063293253233 …
"@KonstantinNotz @anked But what is happening is that mood is still being raised against refugees, for example by CSU boss Seehofer."
@HubertWeiger Congratulations!
"In a climate of sentiment against refugees, confused people and criminals take action and attack refugee accommodation."
Rhetorical incendiary bombs against refugees precede real arson attacks. Those who stir up reservations and moods encourage violent criminals.
Horst Seehofer is back on populist sayings + actions against refugees. Nationwide attacks on refugee homes are increasing.
wishes everyone a good start to the week ;-)
"The first stop on my summer trip on animal protection is Neumünster, where I visit the largest zoo in the country."

"There were hardly any good alternatives: Greece needs help, some is more punishment than medicine. Better: Tax the super rich, less military!"
@Augstein Okay.
I have often said it: Angela Merkel has reached the summit. The remaining direction is down. The descent started today.
"Europe&#39;s future is a community of values, not a nationalist egoist club. Mistakes not only in Athens, but also in Budapest, London, Munich."
"If you only see fiscal categories, you have europ. Didn&#39;t understand the idea. Humanitarian refugee policy, freedom of the press, social Europe - that&#39;s it!"
Austerity policy is no good. Europe needs stability AND growth. Mass youth unemployment is a democracy poison!
"The Union has lost its European political compass, as is shown by today&#39;s debate in the Bundestag. Chancellor&#39;s party flutters, SPD stands!"

@bueti @dneuerer like to have an argument about what is left these days ;-)
"@bueti @dneuerer did you read it? &quot;Left is never nationalist, but always international,&quot; says Europe!"
@bueti @dneuerer I don&#39;t think anything of that either! It is now about responsibility for a common and social Europe!
@OlliLuksic @sigmargabriel nonsense! The SPD wants Europe to stay together and we want that together with our French friends!
@kn_online Very nice!
@spd_gerd Congratulations! I am happy about the victory of SPD candidate Christoph Glogger in my hometown Bad Dürkheim!
@MatthiasHauer @bueti @dneuerer Do you know the difference between knowledge and consent ?!
"Whoever assumes the SPD that we are in favor of a GREXIT, even if only for a time, wants to carry internal problems of the Union into the SPD - forget it!"
@ Doppelgeist60 @JMaxBlank No legends please - SPD doesn&#39;t want to hold GREXIT together but Europe ;-)
Nonsense coordinated “@JMaxBlank: Grexit&quot; position paper Schäubles-coordinated with Merkel / Gabriel #dpaReporter (bk) pic.twitter.com/AGDHXVvWzz ”
"@bueti @dneuerer SPD does not want a GREXIT, but a European solution that is compatible with Greece and the Eurozone."
Germany got a Marshall Plan with a haircut and a subsequent economic miracle after World War II started itself!
The semi-powerful GREXIT propagandists have understood nothing of Europe and its values. Economy is there for people - not the other way around!

Colleague says &quot;CDU as European party is over&quot;. It often seems that way. Too bad. Not solidarity with Greek politics but people!
Anyone who wants to reduce Europe to economic and monetary union has not understood the European idea! Europe of the people not the banks!

"It&#39;s about European values, about social and democratic Europe and not just about an economic and monetary union! Primacy of politics!"
"Desolate situation in Hungary, failure of refugee policy, Nazi parties in parliament, Cameron&#39;s course ... Europe does not only have fiscal problems!"
Anyone who experiences the argumentative power of the right-wing chief propagandists will unfortunately encounter intellectual muckefuck - black and weak 😎😎😎
@RolandTichy @wortwuerfler @HugoMuellerVogg This subterranean diction reveals more about you than you could even like.
"@HugoMuellerVogg You try that again and again ;-) Right is politically unappealing to me on the right, radical right is out of the question!"
"Wonderful this art of turning words around in your mouth. So, I adjust myself occasionally, but not to opinions that I don&#39;t share!"
@HugoMuellerVogg A little passion doesn&#39;t hurt - by no means only in politics by the way 😉 Politics is often far too technocratic!
"In democracy, disputes are part of the game! I don&#39;t avoid skirmishes with my right hand."
"There is the zeitgeisty mainstream, which almost piles up the market-radical position for scientific knowledge. Not with me!"
Conservatives and market radicals are not used to resolutely contradicting the nonsense they spread. Bad luck!
It says I don&#39;t accept other opinions. This is blooming nonsense. I only contradict decisively + do not adapt!
"@HugoMuellerVogg No, I am concerned with the misuse of the word &quot;social&quot; market economy with anti-social content and camouflage of the financiers!"
This employer-funded initiative New (Un) Social Market Economy keeps turning the face of anger.
