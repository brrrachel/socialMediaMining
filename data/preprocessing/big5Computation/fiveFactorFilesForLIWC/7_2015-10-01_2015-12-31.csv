@knuddellove It&#39;s a bit complicated with a CSU that the AFD fakes after - but otherwise you&#39;re right 😉
"@knuddellove This equation of Bavaria and CSU is completely wrong! Bavaria is a beautiful and personable country. Seehofer, scouring ....?"
"@HugoMuellerVogg If we had a government like Bavaria, nobody would be proud here. And whatever you write, it won&#39;t work either!"
Exciting how recently the black and green Mr. Spahn has given the hardliner. Anti-Merkel competition in the Union is producing strange flowers.
Maybe one should give Scheuer (CSU) an edition of the Basic Law and the Geneva Refugee Convention in Bavarian!
"Nationally announced upper limits will no longer exist in the future, such as tolls for foreigners, transit zones or childcare allowance! All CSU nonsense!"
wishes everyone a nice Thursday ;-)
CSU-Scheuer holds quotas for upper limits. To write down: Quotas for war refugees require a European agreement. (1)

@DoroBaer Congratulations!
"Will the CSU soon decide its own time zone for Bavaria? Childcare allowance, international toll + transit zone = impressive series of bankruptcies, bad luck &amp; breakdowns."
Internationally agreed quotas for civil war refugees correspond to the Geneva Refugee Convention agreement is missing!
What is so difficult to understand that a one-sided national upper limit for refugees would be a removal of individual asylum rights?
CSU claim that rioting against its own chancellor pulls a firewall against the right-wing populists is refuted by AFD poll values.
"SH CDU boss L. criticizes Seehofer wg. Merkel attacks sharp. So today, so tomorrow. Flip-flop politician = lightweight with a small turning circle!"

Perhaps the CSU has not yet noticed that affiliation with the AFD leads to an increase in polls among right-wing populists and to a negative CSU.
"Bavaria did not agree to the Basic Law at the time, so the CSU believes that you don&#39;t have to stick to it today."
CSU dupes its own chancellor at the party conference. Bavarian upper limit funds as defiant as the childcare allowance and the international toll.

"While the Chancellor is promoting Germany&#39;s friendly face in the world, party friends Liebing and Spahn are doing the opposite!"
Spahn can team up with Nord-CDU Chef. Would be cool pictures in Liebings deportation TV. New German motto: Courage to be ugly!

@AndiScheuer recording stop? Nonsense. Anyone seeking guidance from right-wing populist Orban should be silent on refugee policy.

@bodoloettgen That was my answer to Mr. Sulik&#39;s disastrous selfish isolation and inhumane fence glorification rhetoric.
"Why do the C parties&#39; solutions to refugee policy always appear legally dubious, anti-Merkel, impractical, inhumane?"
Union wages internal power struggles and tries to make this the problem of the SPD. The only profiteers of government incapacity are AFD &amp; Co.
"Instead of finally implementing agreements, there are hail of new unrefined Union proposals every day. Seriousness? Who actually leads the CDU?"
"No agreement with the Union on refugee policy, which is not immediately followed by a new provocation by CSU or CDU ministers."

(2) Are the transit zones not rejected by the SPD? Then why does CSU say they are coming anyway? It&#39;s like with the international toll.
"Dear Twitter friends, Question of the day: What are transit zones near the border? Right: extra-territorial internment camps for refugees."
Experiment 2: Now Union says that the transit zones are still open. Registration offices to speed up the process yes - transit zones no!
Registration authorities close to the border to speed up procedures have as much in common with transit zones as elephants and mosquitoes. Both are animals.

Neusprechen (4) &quot;We can do it&quot; no longer means energy and confidence (grabbing and rolling up our sleeves) but lack of alarmism.

Very apt commentary on the topic of the day by Marion van Haaren on the transit zone snap idea of the conservatives during the dogfight over regulars&#39; tables.
Transit zones as mass internment camps at the borders: the so-called Christian socialists blow the political security.

"@ArminLaschet @RebHarms @f_kierkegaard @_tillwe_ That&#39;s right, but you have to clarify positions. Whether Merkel spoke for the whole Union?"
@RebHarms @f_kierkegaard @_tillwe_ Wilhelm II would have put it that way.
@RebHarms @f_kierkegaard @_tillwe_
@c_kampmann @ArminLaschet You are an admirable optimist ;-)
@RebHarms @_tillwe_ Our attitude in refugee policy is shared by a huge SPD majority. Does Merkel speak for a Union majority?
"@ArminLaschet @c_kampmann @ThomasOppermann Well, well, confidence in what you just tweeted looks different 😉"
"@ArminLaschet @c_kampmann Well, that&#39;s probably a bit of wishful thinking with all the statements from the CDU and CSU."
"With Anne Will, Merkel argues completely differently than Ms. Klöckner and Mr. Wolf, and not just the opposite of Seehofer. What does Union stand for?"
Notable Merkel appearance with Anne Will (ARD). Quite different from http://CSU. One can look forward to discussion in the Union.
