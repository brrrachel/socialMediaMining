Get involved.
We don&#39;t think we are apart.
Not correct. It takes up exactly your criticisms.
What is responsibility? Do it right today? I try. But in 2003 I really wasn&#39;t there.
"Yes, therefore ALG Q, prohibition of unreasonable time limits, limitations on loan and temporary work. How can you ignore all of this?"
The agenda is 2003! It would be like reducing FC Bayern to Ballack ...
"Do you mean minimum wage, unemployment benefit Q or pension at 63?"
So Peter Struck has addressed it properly. But the CDU has been at the helm for 12 years.
I imagine an SPD defense minister would have insulted the troops as broadly as vdL did. CDU would call for resignation.
Thanks for the link from the committee;)
"Whenever the committee learned something, it acted. But that was always after the press ..."
What would a coach do if he found out after 4 years that he could no longer reach the team? Question for a defense minister.
