"Now it is time to set up a federal party congress of new departure and new cohesion. Neither a headless escape from government responsibility and the associated design options, nor an unimaginative &quot;keep it up - will be fine again&quot; are the right signposts."
Some seem offended by the fact that their own forecast has not come true. Our members decided freely and independently. Perhaps the main message that is understandable should also be that 13-15% in the surveys ‚Äúkeep it up‚Äù is not a solution.
It is unbelievable what has been riddled over the SPD by political rival parties or by media representatives since the result of our membership vote. We should all show together that it is once again premature to write off German Social Democracy!
"This morning, a telephone interview with Radio Bremen. Later various appointments in the Kiel State House. In the afternoon there was another citizen consultation in Bordesholm and a constituency round with my local associations in the &quot;think tank&quot;."

President Trump intimidates and publicly abuses those who convince him of his lies and breaches of the law. American democracy must be strong enough to remove this dangerous hallodri from the White House.

"Yesterday I reported the radical right-wing deputy from Sayn-Wittgenstein to incitement and informed the president of the state parliament.

"Get well soon for @peteraltmaier, who fell badly at an event!"
"AFD voters must not be written off. But everyone has to know that every vote for this right-wing radical party is ultimately a vote against freedom and democracy, against prosperity and peace."
Keep reading that &quot;isolation&quot; is said to strengthen the AFD. What is the alternative? Cooperation with a radical right-wing party? Never! These are enemies of democracy and like H√∂cke some notorious Nazis - you don&#39;t do anything with them - against everything that goes democratically.
"Incidentally, the CDU was a block party member of the &quot;National Front&quot; SPD was banned after forced unification - our people were imprisoned. After the reunification, other members, Organization + took funds with them, the SDP and later the SPD were new or re-established. https://twitter.com/michaelvietz/status/1189094152979529728‚Ä¶"
"Passionate debates about the right compass for a self-confident left-wing People&#39;s Party, for new strength through discussion culture and solidarity - that is what the SPD needs. We don&#39;t need headlines for the change from expolitarians to well-paid lobby jobs in industry!"
Competition for party leadership has shown lively + well-motivated membership at SPD regional conferences. A new profile + new cohesion + solidarity are necessary if a new strength is to be found.
The wash in the Union and the unspeakable comparisons between the Left Party of Bodo Ramelow and H√∂cke&#39;s neo-Nazi club show the dilemma in the burning glass. Red-green-red ruled well - maybe a minority government has to start. The CDU &amp; FDP also have a responsibility.
Thuringia shows where it will lead if a radical right-wing party with a notorious Nazi at the top can achieve such votes. The time to wait is over for Democrats. Much more determined counter-strategies have to be found and implemented!
"After the brilliant 6-2 in the league game on Saturday, HSV is again expecting VfB Stuttgart this time in the DFB Cup. Hopefully with a similarly good game and a home win."
That for which @Gesine_Schwan and I fought and got votes to adjust the right compass for a strong and self-confident SPD back on the course of the left People&#39;s Party remains correct and continues! So offended liver sausage and withdrawal is not. We stay on board!
"We have criticized in recent weeks that members have been patronized. That is why @Gesine_Schwan + ich will not do that between the elections and will not make any election recommendations. We clearly said what we stand for. In the end, the selected team is supported!"
In democracy you have to have the courage to face a democratic choice and the strength to respect the result. This also applies to our social democracy.
@Gesine_Schwan and I would also like to thank the volunteers who supported us and all the great colleagues who organized this application tour. That was great and the procedural criticism is cheap and unjustified.
"Precisely because we did not have the support of large national associations, subdivisions or back room deals, @Gesine_Schwan + I got the votes for our offer, which we passionately and genuinely presented at 23 regional conferences. Thanks for that!"
"#unsereSPD has chosen the first ballot for a new team of chairs. @Gesine_Schwan + I thank you for a lot of positive feedback + support. Even if it wasn&#39;t enough for the runoff election, it was a great tour of Germany and moved a lot."
"Election also in Kiel, where Ulf K√§mpfer, a great mayor, is running for re-election. Every vote for the social democrat Ulf K√§mpfer is a vote for a good future for the state capital Kiel."
Today is elected in Thuringia. All votes for @SPDThueringen and a democratic progressive government. No influence for the right-wing AfD and the right-wing democracy enemies!

"Outrageous comparison of the CDU parliamentary group leader Koch, who after the GroKo debate warns the SPD to put ‚Äúparty interests before the wellbeing of the country‚Äù as in the Weimar Republic ü§îThe SPD, who voted against Hitler&#39;s enabling law at the risk of life, pacted as conservatives and Nazis."
Tonight he was a guest of ‚ÄúMarkus Lanz‚Äù on ZDF.
"Today first a radio interview with an American broadcaster. Then it goes to Berlin for a meeting of the expanded Presidium, which advises on the mid-term review of the GroKo and prepares the party executive and the federal party congress."
In the evening I then discussed with the local association round in my constituency about the current situation in the federal party after the member vote and before the federal party conference.
"Yesterday, people with very different concerns came to my citizens&#39; consultation in Bordesholm."

Bordesholm made positive headlines across Germany yesterday. The electricity storage (self-sufficient energy supply from 100% renewable energies) worked 100% and without any problems in the real-life test. Socially compatible climate protection and energy transition are necessary and possible!
Media + political competition overturn with doomed scenarios + catastrophe descriptions for German social democracy after our members voted for @NowaboFM + @EskenSaskia. Let us prove the opposite with passion + cohesion!

"Even with parental relief, we show Jamaica how social and family-friendly policies work (freedom from learning materials, free cr√®che). In all of this, there is little and dissent in the matter in the government coalition - covered with Advent PR concord frosting."
"Yesterday Beate Raudies and I publicly presented the budget proposals of the SPD parliamentary group. While Jamaica only practices climate protection in a homeopathic dose (this is probably the influence of the Greens üòâ), this is a clear focus for us (bike paths, bogs, forest, public transport)."

Yesterday was also the day that was supposed to commemorate the explosive and unfortunately highly topical issue of ‚Äúviolence against women‚Äù. Not enough is being done to outlaw and effectively combat this violence. It is unworthy of a civilized country.
"The members of the SPD can still decide which chair team the party can and should lead. The task description is: programmatic profile as a left-wing people&#39;s party, new cohesion and a self-confident party that you can rely on again!"

"The attitude of the Jamaica coalition in Schleswig-Holstein to the climate protection package of the federal government is extremely hypocritical, because Mr. G√ºnther won his election campaign with the broken election promise to enforce even greater distances to wind turbines."
"Incidentally, it is an existential question that we can achieve the agreed climate targets. The socially responsible ecological restructuring of our industrial society is our duty! This includes 65% from renewable energy."
"Climate protection goals can only be achieved if the 65% target is achieved from renewable energy. The Federal Government, the Union and in particular the responsible minister @peteraltmaier must finally deliver! Anything else would seriously damage our political credibility!"
"Our members now have the floor for the vote for the SPD party chairmanship. They neither need election recommendations (least of all from the outside like the unfortunate legal interpreter Maassen), unsolidated attacks against teams and also no announcement of candidates for individual first-person shooters."
"Today we visit the House of Representatives in Mainz again, are in the broadcasting center of the ZDF and take a look at the SPD district office in Ludwigshafen am Rhein."
"During a dinner with regional specialties, a friendly exchange with Malu Dreyer, Alexander Schweizer and our hosts of the SPD parliamentary group, who are very well positioned."
A joint meeting with the colleagues of the SPD parliamentary group in Rhineland-Palatinate and a round with social democratic local politicians showed many similarities in topics and challenges.
Interesting visit program yesterday for us on the parliamentary group trip to Rhineland-Palatinate. Impressive works council and staff council forum in the OPEL ARENA. Good social partnership and a lot of commitment of the social democratic government for good work.

"Mr. Maassen, the unfortunate former head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, is doing enough damage in his own party, the Union - he shouldn&#39;t bother the SPD with unsolicited calls. Those who fond of right-wing polulists will certainly not influence the SPD member vote. üòÇ"
An interesting discussion and visit program awaits us today. So we meet for a joint meeting with the party friends of the SPD parliamentary group and take part in a &quot;Works Council and Personnel Council&quot; with our Prime Minister Malu Dreyer.
"Later on to Mainz, where the SPD parliamentary group from Schleswig-Holstein arrived yesterday evening for this year&#39;s parliamentary trip. The group manager of the SPD state parliamentary group Rhineland-Palatinate Fedor Ruhose met us for dinner in the old town of Mainz."
Yesterday day 2 of the SPD parliamentary group chairperson conference in Schwerin. We are concerned with the current struggle against the democratic enemies of the right. It also dealt with old municipal debts and social democratic strategies to solve this question.

"The run-off election starts in the member vote for the SPD party chair. The main task is a signal of departure at the Federal Party Congress, which combines programmatic clarity as a left-wing People&#39;s Party + creative will with new cohesion of a broad-based, self-confident SPD."
"In the afternoon we continue to Mainz. Faction tour of the SPD parliamentary group from Schleswig-Holstein to Rhineland-Palatinate, where we have an interesting visit and discussion program."
"Yesterday, the SPD group leader conference of the federal and state governments in beautiful Schwerin. We discussed various topics and also met our Prime Minister Manuela Schwesig. Consultations continue until noon today."
"Social democracy in no way refuses to accept international missions with a legally sound UN mandate + the consent of the Bundestag. Priority for diplomacy, disarmament + d√©tente! No arms exports to crisis areas + dictatorships! @akk NATO advance was wrong! https://twitter.com/michaelvietz/status/1195248793148637184‚Ä¶"
CDU federal party conference should clarify whether Union really wants the militarization of German foreign policy proposed by @akk. The SPD does not have such crazy ideas as sending German ground troops to the Middle East in the NATO framework (‚Äúsecurity zone‚Äù Syria)!
"Run-off vote in the member vote on the SPD party chairmanship is approaching. It is crucial that the Federal Party congress produces a clear compass as a broadly based left People&#39;s Party, new cohesion + intra-party solidarity and self-confident social democracy!"
"During the plenary debate on Jewish life in Schleswig-Holstein, it was very uncomfortable how much space the right-wing radical AFD took up. What is important is the signal that all democratic groups are united in the fight against anti-Semitism. Who attacks synagogues attacks us all!"
"In the state parliament, Jamaica once again demonstrated total disagreement in the agricultural debate. I am curious how long G√ºnther &amp; Co will let the &quot;diversity is so great&quot; go through. Not with PR, but in terms of substance GroKo is a harmony event."

"The disagreement of the Jamaica coalition in Schleswig-Holstein can be seen in all its glory today in agricultural policy. This characterizes this coalition more than anything else, despite the sugar-sweet &quot;How great our diversity of opinion is&quot; government propaganda."
"Debate on the state of agriculture in the state parliament. Great speech by my colleague Kirsten Eickhoff-Weber on a modern, sustainable, economically reasonable + socially just future. CDU speaker: Applause CDU. Green speaker: applause green. FDP speaker: applause CDU / FDP OR FDP / green. Jamaica üòÇ"

Scientific study shows a worrying picture of youth vulnerability to right-wing extremist attitudes. Prevention work and political education must absolutely be intensified in order to dig the political rat catchers from the right!
The dismissal of the right-wing radical agitator Brandner as chairman of the legal committee in the Bundestag once again showed how the AFD arsonists try to stage themselves as biederm√§nnen and persecuted victims. Only a few jerks fall for this greasy comedy.
"Donald Trump once again showed his special soft spot for dictators + potentates during the Erdogan visit to Washington. He insulted the Europeans and certified his friend from Ankara ‚Äúa fantastic job‚Äù. For the show-off + liar in the White House, this is a natural connection."
Numerous appointments on the edge of the plenary. In the evening a ceremony for the 70th birthday of the DGB in Hamburg.
Yesterday evening at the celebration of 50 years of political education in the social democratic Gustav Heinemann training center in Malente. Funny speech by J√ºrgen Weber.

For me it&#39;s back to Berlin this afternoon.
Hopefully tonight the last round of tugging about the basic pension. This is neither advertising for the GroKo nor for politics in general.
Deserved draw yesterday at the northern derby of the HSV in Kiel.
Nice birthday party yesterday at Bj√∂rn Engholm in L√ºbeck. There was a lot of talk about the difficult situation of social democracy. Members decide on the chair team. That is the smallest of the challenges. Public recommendations from celebrities are useless.
Much reporting about 30 years of the fall of the Berlin Wall and German unity. Reason to celebrate and reason to work hard on further unification process.

"Today, the parliamentary groups meet in the Kiel Landeshaus and, in addition to various meetings, a party event in L√ºtjenburg is waiting for the evening."
"Instead of hyperventilating the CDU, because Heiko Maas answers a journalist&#39;s question truthfully, @akk&#39;s taboo breach of sending German ground troops to the Middle East (which is the quintessence of their &quot;security zone&quot;) should also not provoke UN (!) Outrage within the NATO framework. üëé"
"Intolerable rapprochement between Thuringian CDU people and right-wing extremist AFD (&quot;open-ended&quot; talks). Democrats don&#39;t pact with Nazis like H√∂cke &amp; Co. - If CDU Spitze cannot prevent this, it is politically responsible!"
"Government parties do not decide on GroKo&#39;s mid-term review. Thanks to the SPD, some things have been successful, such as parity in health insurance, family support or good work. Other things like basic pension, socially acceptable climate protection, disarmament initiatives, basic child protection are pending."
"Correct judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court on Hartz IV sanctions. SPD has presented a new solidarity-based welfare state concept that actively combats long-term unemployment. For the rest, the subsistence minimum must be granted without sanctions - for me this results from Art 1 GG!"
"Today council of elders to prepare for the next parliamentary session. In addition, various interview appointments in the Kiel State House and later to Stuttgart."

Anyone who wants to hold open-ended talks with right-wing radical AFD and Nazi crooks is not politically tight and is definitely no longer a partner for social democracy! Thuringian CDU and federal party should stop this political rampage immediately! #NieWiederRechts
The external image in the debate about the basic pension is very negative and promotes all clich√©s that are against democratic politics. It is about the simple matter of course that decades of work must bring more than the basic security for everyone.
"Yesterday there was another conversation between the SPD and SSW, as has been a tradition in our cooperation for years."
"Today is the second day of our budget exam in the SPD parliamentary group. In addition, various interview appointments in the Kiel State House."

CDU claim that political &quot;borders&quot; with which one should not cooperate are strengthened in Thuringia is Mumpitz. Bodo Ramelow is as much Rand in Thuringia as Winfried Kretschmann in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Comparison with Nazi H√∂cke is defamatory. R2G is good government!
"When Gauland says H√∂cke is the ‚Äúcenter of the AFD‚Äù, he confirms the truth for once. The notorious Nazi H√∂cke is the center of a radical right-wing party that should have been under surveillance by the secret service. The goal must be to drive the AFD out of parliaments!"
H√∂cke has probably received a notice from the Reichsschrifttumskammer. https://twitter.com/EnricoTokarEU/status/1188815617031360512‚Ä¶
"After very intensive weeks of intra-party competition for party leadership, the run-off phase is now coming. In the end, we need more cohesion and solidarity within the party and a federal party congress that succeeds as a departure into more successful times."
"The executive committees meet today in the Willy-Brandt-Haus. Then it&#39;s back to Schleswig-Holstein. With the clear re-election of Ulf K√§mpter as mayor of Kiel, there was at least something good yesterday!"
That the right-wing radicals with a notorious Nazi at the top in Thuringia get so many percent remains a huge challenge for the Democrats.
"The election in Thuringia with a single-digit result for the SPD is of course very unpleasant. In the end, as in Brandenburg and Saxony, there was a polarization between the Prime Minister (this time Bodo Ramelow / Left Party) and the right-wing extremist AFD. Now it&#39;s getting difficult."

"Before going back to Frankfurt this evening, there are a few foreign policy talks and media talks on my visit program. Overall, I am returning with many impressions, also with regard to the high expectations placed on German social democracy."
"The dinner with journalists also brought some insights into the situation in Russia, the conflict over Ukraine and other issues."
"Later I met Fedor Voitolowsky, head of the Primakov Institute for World Economy and International Relations, an experienced and knowledgeable observer of international politics with whom I had a very interesting conversation."
"In the afternoon, in addition to a television interview, there were again talks about German-Russian youth exchange and the alumni portal &quot;Hallo Deutschland&quot;."
The interest in better relationships and the expansion of economic and political cooperation with Germany can be felt everywhere. That&#39;s what lunch at the German Embassy was about.
"Exciting day in Moscow. Breakfast with Veronika Krashenninnikova, an up-and-coming government advisor, dealt with all bilateral issues. This also applied to the conversation in the State Department with head of department Oleg Tyapkin. Significantly more positive signals than in 2015."

"Stop downplaying the right-wing radical AFD! We do not need any further attacks as a warning sign for those who make fire speeches and hate and incite them. H√∂cke, Gauland, Weidel, Meuthen &amp; Co. bear direct political responsibility for terror from the right!"

Then back in the afternoon in the north.
"The SPD members can choose their top duo for another 5 days. I will do that soon. It is crucial that the chairing team, together with the entire party leadership, can also lead our party well! With a clear profile as a left-wing People&#39;s Party and new cohesion!"
"It&#39;s a good thing that Mr. Wendt cannot become State Secretary in Saxony-Anhalt. Fortunately, the SPD and Greens have shown the red card to such really adventurous and absurd plans by their conservative coalition partner."
"Today, the SPD management bodies meet in the Willy-Brandt-Haus. It is about the preparation of the federal party congress after the members have decided on the party presidency next weekend."

"For just under a week, our members can vote who should lead the SPD in the future. For this they do not need any recommendations or advice, no negative social media campaigns against a team and no other public personnel debates."
"Congratulations to the re-elected Juso chairman @KuehniKev We need strong @jusos in the reorganization of our @spdde as a clearly profiled left-wing People&#39;s Party, which radiates new cohesion and new self-confidence after the presidential election and federal party congress."
"At the CDU party conference, @akk has won a stage - probably not more. Friedrich Merz made satire-ready comments in his speech on the topic of loyalty and tried to distract from his &quot;grotto-bad&quot; performance mit with the attack against the SPD."
Today I go with my boys to the HSV home game against Dynamo Dresden in the Volkpark Stadium in Hamburg. Three points have to be won! #only the HSV
