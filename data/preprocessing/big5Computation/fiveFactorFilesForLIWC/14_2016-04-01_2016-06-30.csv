Negotiations with # Turkey must be ended immediately and a fair partnership agreement with the British instead.
The new #CSU clubhouse was inaugurated today. The address has changed - the order remains! https://t.co/L7LmhMoWQv
# Brussels probably didn&#39;t hear the wake-up call. #London threaten and #Ankara court - that cannot be the future of Europe.
#Europe will become stronger if we remind it that it is made up of strong and sovereign nations. For a Europe of Nations.
An intensive partnership with Great Britain is more important than one with Turkey.
Prudence and fairness with Great Britain! That is the right answer in difficult times.
"If you want to throw UK out of #EU as quickly as possible and still hold on to Turkey&#39;s accession, you are on the wrong track."
Closed conference of @CDU and @CSU in Potsdam has started! Heaven white-blue! https://t.co/8z72vP9YPJ
@ AnjaReschke1 @ CSU Ja. Super super mega!
Scandalous that the funds for the # childcare allowance in other federal states are used to plug budget holes.
Families are better off in Bavaria! Bavarian families will continue to receive childcare allowance.
#Bavaria supports its #families like no other federal state - in 2015 and 2016 alone with around 3 billion euros annually.

Supporting our boys with the national colors is part of the summer fairy tale and is healthy patriotism. # EURO2016
Federal Minister of Justice @HeikoMaas must act urgently! https://t.co/OXwebFaPJB

"Seehofer looks at the situation in flooded areas. Over 5000 buildings affected, 7000 helpers are deployed. https://t.co/UHGPgdPGjN"
Seehofer makes it clear that Bavaria will do everything humanly possible to help those affected by the flood quickly and without red tape.
Now it says: #Groko must finally be able to implement many topics. The next few weeks will be crucial.
Only with a clear course and convincing future topics will the Union regain trust against the mood of protest.
"If the CDU and SPD align more and more, it will harm everyone."
"Stable surveys, great approval for @CSU in #Bayern! And the #GroKo in Berlin is descending. That must be a warning sign!"

Anyone who speaks of troublemakers after a constructive discussion in the Chancellery admits that he has no idea of reality. @Ralf_Stegner
RT @CSU:. @ Andischeuer: # Turkey must not become a member of the #EU and complete visa-free travel is not possible with this Turkey…
RT @CSU: # Clear text by @andischeuer: Erdogan&#39;s policies have nothing to do with the values of enlightened Europe. https://t.co/BtxaZT...
We cannot exchange the refugee wave for a visa wave. We are against importing the domestic conflict into Germany.
"Fundamental and #human rights are trampled on in # Erdogan-Turkey, the #EU must not close their eyes to it."
@CSU is against complete # visa freedom for # Turkey. Turkey is far from meeting all visa criteria.
@ Wahl_beobachter am still trying out. Exciting medium!
RT @CSU: Today is the day: Our Secretary General @AndiScheuer answers your questions on our Facebook page. #fragCSU https://t.co/…
Prime Minister Horst #Seehofer opens the state exhibition 2016 &quot;Beer in Bavaria&quot; in Alderabach. https://t.co/16nuj0dwYy
@AuswaertigesAmt &quot;It is strongly discouraged to make political statements against the Turkish state in public.&quot;
"Erdogan Turkey moves away from European core values. In the meantime, everyone must be clear: Erdogan Turkey does not fit in with enlightened Europe"
#Erdogan has to be careful that his brutal approach to freedom of expression does not lead to the absence of German tourists.
The travel warning from @AuswaertigesAmt means red alert for freedom of speech for German holidaymakers. There is no warning for no reason
@AuswaertigesAmt: &quot;It is strongly advised not to publicly pol. To make statements against the Turkish state. “# Turkey
The @AuswaertigesAmt has issued current travel and safety information for Turkey.
"We cannot and do not want to accept that other, sometimes extreme, values are imported from abroad."
All imams must be trained in Germany and share our basic values.
"The financing of mosques or Islamic kindergartens from abroad, for example from Turkey or from Saudi Arabia, must be stopped."
We have to take a more critical look at political Islam because it hinders the fact that people integrate with us.
For @CSU and the entire #EU it is clear: there is no discount on human rights. Erdogan # Turkey is moving further and further away from Europe.
Visa relief can only be granted if # Turkey finally respects human rights and freedom of expression. That is a clear decision.
# Turkey must consider whether it stands by its commitments.
Full house in Lower Bavaria during the basic dialogue with Horst #Seehofer. How to get involved! #SeehoferDirekt https://t.co/K9dU7B0l0A
"If the number of refugees decreases, the police force at the border can be reduced, but in no case can it be withdrawn completely. #klartext"
Talking about an end to #border controls is the completely wrong signal being sent here - also for security reasons.
"The style is bad, the approach wrong and it doesn&#39;t do justice to the sensitivity of the topic. # Border controls # Asylum"
The Federal Minister of the Interior de Maiziere brings an end to the # border controls in the discussion into the Austrian media without discussion.
@CSU is strictly against EU membership of # Turkey. The basic Turkish understanding does not fit with enlightened Europe.
"Freedom of expression, press and religion are trampled on in Erdogan # Turkey."
# Turkey has moved further and further away from the values of the #EU in recent years.
