Anyone who remains an official or voter of this party after (!) It is clear that they are working with right-wing extremists is lost to democracy. Hamburg shows that consequences can be drawn

"Agree if it was about an effective integration into the income tax. But I criticize those who really want to relieve top earners of EUR 10 billion a year. I don&#39;t want that, this money is used for investments, more staff etc."
"1. If you always focus on this point, then already 2. I am simply in favor of an appreciative choice of words in the discourse"
"That is why we exempt 50-95% of the highest incomes from solos, which costs about 10 billion euros per year. It would cost that much again to relieve even the highest incomes. This is about six-figure amounts per individual case. The money is missing somewhere else"
50% do not pay today because solos only start from a certain amount of tax payment. 90% of the remaining 50% are also fully relieved by raising this limit. Together makes 95%
"1. Did FDP in plenary today and 2. Save yourself words like &quot;nonsense&quot;, that&#39;s undemocratic"

"Dear @ChrisKuehn_mdb, in Schleswig-Holstein you decided in the coalition agreement to abolish the rent brake. In Hesse and BaW√º it was implemented so badly that the implementation regulation fails in court ... And yes, with CDU / CSU, no time limit is possible"
"First, the rent brake should only apply to existing buildings, not to new buildings. Second, the &quot;hole&quot; obligation to provide information is now closed. The question remains as to why Greens in the federal government call &quot;H√ºh&quot; and in the state (eg Schleswig-Holstein) &quot;Hott&quot;, ie abolish the rental price brake"
Why are you in the federal government for more # rent brakes and then abolish them in state governments?
"Oh, in my constituency, I actually did quite well to be very honest on the one hand, but at the same time to focus on the issues that count and not on the wave of outrage"
"The SPD officials can do that too. But I expect them to use their strength to talk about our successes and suggestions in daycare, housing, retirement, health, education, infrastructure"
It is fundamentally wrong
"Because we don&#39;t have to sound at all, but sell our SUCCESS. The Federal Cabinet has just passed a bill on the proposal of the SPD so that the federal government can give a further 5.5 billion euros to states and municipalities for daycare centers"
"Sure, whoever disagrees with you, does so only to protect his &quot;post&quot;. Exactly the kind of discussion I meant :-("
So you want to make the rental price brake even more stringent in the federal government than the SPD could achieve in a coalition. Speaks for. But nothing has been heard from you that the black-green state government is lifting the price brake completely and wanted to leave Jamaica unchanged !? #GrauistalleTheorie
It is a success because Maassen no longer leads the protection of the constitution. That was the most important thing. It is not an advertisement for democracy because Seehofer wants to keep it around him.

"The regulation is for five years, a respite. You feel like you&#39;re overdoing it"
"It is about a regulation that the rent for existing buildings can not be raised arbitrarily, what harm does this do to the new building?"
‚ÄúHate makes ugly‚Äù is an insult at the very most for those who radiate hatred. Did the AfD then admit this in a highly official way?
The term was indeed chosen incorrectly by the colleague. He meant landlords and only the part there that uses the housing shortage to massively increase the return
You shouldn&#39;t be so strict with yourself
"I know. The coalition agreement does not only apply to CDU / CSU MPs, but also to CDU / CSU MPs"
Let&#39;s put your cheap populism aside: where do you see the problem with other landlords? Yield is retained if you can adjust inflation.
"You&#39;re right, the @schneidercar took the wrong term. We both know that he meant landlords by the way. And there only those who have used the emergency for excessive increases in yield"
"They do not go into the main argument: In the five years, the return = pension does not decrease, since you can compensate for inflation. I&#39;m not going to go into your populist game with the parliamentary pension scheme"
I am a landlord myself. I don&#39;t see myself discriminated against if rules are introduced under the landlords to protect against black sheep. May rent increase only five years as high as inflation? This is not a burden # rent stop
"Well, whoever goes out has to come in again. Herbert Wehner already knew that"
You üòù
"Why do you absolutely want to be able to increase rent and yield at 40 million existing apartments depending on the market situation? This does not even create an incentive for new construction, since this crumb theory has long since been empirically refuted"

"Flat-rate? If you avoid the same (!) Question six times? Well, if only it is possible for you to reject everything ... üôÑ"
"So far planning paper, bill is still coming. Preservation statutes will play a role"
And for the sixth time elegantly circumnavigated answer that GDR regulation (freeze rent and thus eventually losses) and SPD proposal (5 year increase just like inflation) are not comparable at all. So you are a failure as a serious partner. Pity!

"This pack takes to the streets, goes to people, others march along, secret sympathizers sit in parliament, a CDU prime minister downplayed that, the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is blind or seduced. It is not irrelevant"
"Thank you, but only corrected the area error. A sum of the years 2018-2021 still shows on the left, only a single value 2021 on the right"
"Doubly dubious: Firstly tricked with the area ratio, that is not relative to the numbers. Secondly, in the case of additional income (incl. Inflation), the sum will be taken until 2021, but only the individual value of 2021 if there is relief. This is not done, please correct"
And you seriously say that a five-year limitation on rent increases to inflation would bring GDR conditions to the state of the building? That is grotesque
"IMF ‚Äúexpert‚Äù claims that #leasing freeze would lead to more conversion of rental apartments to condominiums. Proves that he has not really examined SPD proposals, it contains regulations that make such conversions legally more difficult"
"Also nonsense in fact, since you are comparing a regulation without inflation compensation with a regulation that provides for inflation compensation. And then criticize the lack of inflation compensation in the text. But you notice it yourself, don&#39;t you?"

That was not agreed in the coalition agreement. But we are now introducing the new pension formula required for this. The SPD-led Ministry of Finance will explain the affordability and then someone has to dare to worsen the pension formula again
"Stabilizing pensions, improving disability, lowering social security contributions for low earners are &quot;real improvements&quot;"
The change in the pension formula in such a way that pensions now rise again like wages is decided today in the cabinet and then goes into the Bundestag as a bill :-)
"Oh, we are proud that we defended the Republic against these guys at the time and will do it again this time against those with the fool&#39;s cross"
But only if you want to be wrong
CDU / CSU were opposed to the change in the pension policy and wanted the pension level to decrease. SPD has prevailed 100%
"No, you can already look at an expert opinion and refer to it, for example, if the members of the advisory board have not even properly understood the law. If they still want to publish then they make themselves ridiculous"

"Fact check: Members&#39; salaries are also increasing, as is the general wage trend"
"Not correct. Under Schr√∂der, the tax subsidy for pensions rose particularly quickly. Nachlesbar. What is your misstatement based on?"
"Stupid cross in the account name and facts do not get along: The tax subsidy to the pension fund is higher than the so-called &quot;non-insurance benefits&quot;, which incidentally also includes the mother&#39;s pension"
"Not the lowest denominator. The stabilization mechanism will now become law, guaranteed until 2025. And the SPD-led Federal Ministry of Finance will work out a proposal for what the guarantee will look like until 2040"
That someone with the cross in the account name quotes the enemies of the republic (&quot;who betrayed us&quot;) is not surprising
And now it&#39;s going to be law
"Come down. Yesterday decided that the law is in the Federal Cabinet today, then it goes to the Bundestag, and it will be valid this year"
"Yes, but the problem was not virulent before. We have to regulate for technical reasons, but of course technology-neutral"

"I was not concerned with whether it was hot or not (didn&#39;t feel that way), but rather that the reaction that I shouldn&#39;t criticize another party&#39;s broadband policy because my party wasn&#39;t doing everything right was unpolitical"

"Analog distribution of digital security. I like it. Unfortunately, the BSI does not get the resources it needs"
"This is not an answer, in 2013 the money was already in the household and was not spent"
Not correct! The EP explicitly rejected the EP&#39;s negotiating position proposed by the CDU rapporteur Voss
It&#39;s not OK. The majority of the council took decisions in 2007 and 2013 (both times with CDU) to renovate the baths and then failed to act. Citizens can now vote freely and should not be held responsible for ten years of downtime #Bonn

"Agree: Largest pan short, second largest pan Seehofer and then third place Laschet"

"Without getting too close to the former BfDI :-), there is the whole spectrum: State Secretary as secret minister to breakfast director. And let&#39;s wait and see # Bavarian election"
I say the same thing as yesterday: he cannot remain head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution
Not every discourse is a &quot;blow&quot;
"It was an answer, not a statement. And yes, I think it&#39;s a good thing that # Maassen is no longer the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, but State Secretary until the minister changes #Bayernwahl #CSU #NachtderlangenMesser"
"No, it&#39;s not okay, but at what function in a ministry would you no longer ask the coalition question?"
"Yes, because of this, he couldn&#39;t remain the chief of one of the most important security agencies. Whom Seehofer hires in his ministry can only be decided by him as long as he is a minister. When do you want to ask coalition questions: State Secretary, Head of Department, Head of Subdivision?"
The ministerial representation takes over the representation of the minister in the cabinet. I wonder now whether you really didn&#39;t know that or just wanted to turn the revolt wheel
"And: The term ‚Äúhead gardener‚Äù shows that you don&#39;t even read the reports. Of course, # Maassen does not become responsible for the secret services, ie not the &quot;superior&quot; of the next head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution"

Very right. And because he lied to Parliament

There is a difference between a change in the law (we can prevent it) and nonsense from a person&#39;s mouth (we criticize)
"So we are also responsible for the departmental work of coalition partners? I see it very differently. We provide funds and enforce priorities. The CDU / CSU are responsible for their own work. If you want more SPD, you have to choose SPD"
Example Bonn: From 2020 there will be massive construction sites to remedy the renovation cases and to expand. The problem is rather the large number of construction sites as a result of years of inactivity
"For example, to lay down the necessary investments for this in the coalition agreement and in the federal budget"
"CSU-led since 2009. Got a lot of money for broadband for four years, but done nothing. All theory is gray"
Anyone who publicly doubts press reports should be able to provide their evidence. Tagesschau has experts watch video (s) that do not question the authenticity. There are also a number of eyewitnesses to similar incidents. You confuse something with discourse quality

"One suggestion: in Berlin-Mitte, when building on buildings, do not (almost) always make the bypass road a one-way street for all road users, but leave it open for cycling. Saves dangerous detours, works in other cities. Otherwise: good job!"
"Air traffic does not work, rail traffic does not work, freeway bridges are closed, broadband expansion lags behind and funds available are not spent. A CSU-led ministry for 10 years, but prefers to &quot;take care of other issues&quot;"

Solidarity and justice are fundamental values of the SPD. This leads to the commitment to comprehensive and timely #climate protection. In order to give / leave the same opportunities to all regions of the world and future generations. This must not be played off against social issues
"If you repeatedly raise the same, long since refuted claim / question that the Holocaust did not exist, then you are not critical / curious, but want to deny an unprecedented mass murder"

Apples and pears. A party exclusion attempt has already failed because the German party law requires that you have to prove that the party has been harmed

"None that you accept is plausible, so again: An introduction for all existing pensions in one fell swoop would cost many billions of euros annually"
"Because the majority of councils from the CDU, the Greens and the FDP always demand further savings from the municipal utilities and therefore there is a lack of vehicles and drivers"
The pension increase always applies to the individual &quot;pension point&quot; and thus to everyone
"The CDU rejected the 48% stabilization, the SPD used it to campaign. So bad memory?"

Nonsense. Why don&#39;t you ask @cducsubt like us what &quot;transit zones&quot; are supposed to be?
Once again: Bonn won the top position mentioned in the days of the SPD mayors. The newcomer from the CDU just didn&#39;t lose him :-)
"That would be nonsense if it did, but it doesn&#39;t"
"This is not a question, it is speculation"
"Where are the journalists actually asking what exactly the &quot;transit centers&quot; should be, instead of simply adopting the term?"
"What exactly are the ‚Äútransit zones‚Äù, dear @ZDFheute? Please don&#39;t fall for words, but check what exactly is meant"
Well then. What exactly is a transit warehouse according to your compromise? Closed or open? For individual travelers or families? For how long maximum? Access to legal advice from the start? And what do you do if Rome and Vienna reject the agreement? You call it PROFESSIONAL WORK
What do you think about publicly strengthening your back to the SPD instead of threatening to leave and thereby playing along with the CSU? We are now forcing them to explain your suggestions in detail and will then respond.
