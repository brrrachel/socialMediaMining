"With Donald Trump it is clear: this man is irrational. Europe must now move closer together. I urge Angela Merkel, the CDU and CSU to move here, as we decided in the coalition agreement. Europe can and must be the power for peace in the world."
Europe is high on the Macron agenda. Today he also receives the #Karlspreis for his foresight that we need a strong foreign and security policy of our own. For: félicitations! Europe is also at the top of the coalition agreement. We have to tackle that now. pic.twitter.com/lJ8Lbu3rwK
"By protecting Israel, we protect ourselves - from the demons of our own past. Therefore, not only do we have a duty to safeguard Israel&#39;s right to exist, we also have every reason to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the State of Israel."
"Without a strong Europe, the populists win - and then there is war. In Germany it is up to the SPD to prevent this. In the coalition agreement, we decided to move to Europe. It has to come now. I want to continue to contribute to this in the future."
"Keep your fingers crossed for our boys, everything is still in there! #GERSWE"
"The CSU plays with fears to distract from its own problems. Only Europe can solve the challenges of our time. If we distribute the refugees fairly in Europe, a country like Hungary would have to accept 1290 refugees. This is not an overload."
Time for more literature. Tonight I can present Arthur Koestler&#39;s &quot;Solar Eclipse&quot; in the literary quartet. I am happy if you tune in. Either way: very clear reading recommendation! pic.twitter.com/nyhH6PPtLX
"At a time when Europe needs a stable Germany, the CSU willfully causes a government crisis. Not because of the migration, but because of the Bavarian state election. Irresponsible. At 10.30 p.m. I discuss it with Maybrit Illner. Turn on."
"Donald Trump is a real crime statistics expert: hush money for porn stars, illegal contacts with Russia, and a jailed campaign manager."
It&#39;s time to fight for Europe! It&#39;s not about billions more or less in households. It&#39;s about an epochal model of peace and the survival of free democracy! http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/martin-schulz-ueber-europa-es-ist-zeit-zu-kaempfen-a-1211286.html…
"Ambassadors are representatives of their states and not political movements. However, US Ambassador #Grenell is not acting like a diplomat, but like a far-right colonial officer. We cannot tolerate such behavior."
