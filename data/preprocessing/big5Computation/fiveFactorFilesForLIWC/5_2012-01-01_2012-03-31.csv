"Why doesn&#39;t the constitutional treasury monitor the CDU / CSU, which have sympathy for the democracy reduction of their party friend Orban in Hungary?"
"@ pgk1966 Oh, no more steel beams or gold jewelry &quot;Made in Germany&quot;?"
It is good that we are talking today in the plenary about the brainless observation / sniffing out of the Left Party

"@tomaschek But if there are 1.1 divisional business trips per ministerial official, few have to commute all the time, right?"
@tomaschek 1.1 flights times travel time = effort per year. I use time to work. PS But business trips from BN to Brussels are faster

@kogekisha But set priorities. Increasing education expenditure and lowering new debt in 2012. Can red-green in NRW. Don&#39;t fret!
"@tomaschek I haven&#39;t canceled the dialog, I&#39;m still waiting for your first argument (!). Or did I miss something?"
That&#39;s how you do it. NRW increases expenditure on universities and research by 6% to a record level. SPD shows how to keep campaign promises

"@ralphmakolla @jkahrs Pointlessly pulverizing billions is hardly in the interest of the state as a whole, is it? Where are there really problems?"
"Very good speech by the CDU / CSU MdB Herrmann, that&#39;s also the attitude of the SPD. The MdB Kahrs only gives his private opinion :-)"
"Quite right, the expenses (not costs) for the division of labor in Berlin / Bonn are falling (now already below 10 million), costs for moving billions !!!"
"CDU / CSU spokesman Herrmann is right, Berlin / Bonn application of the left, repeated annually, is a pure show event"
6 Left MdB are interested in their own application to end the Berlin / Bonn law. Yawn!
