What is sustainable? Too spongy to really change the life situation of those affected. #Cocoa conference http://www.taz.de/!5497448/
Nothing.
"Doctors against # malnutrition! Even more support so as not to leave those affected alone. Too much sugar, too many processed foods on the go."
The compilation of the guests already says which mess the show wanted. #hartaberfair is now the right boulevard. Too bad about the good time.

Unfortunately very apt. If you experience politics today and debates in the Bundestag today.
The project is called: Overtake AfD right winger. But it is already boiling in the soul of the decent former CSU voters!
"The difference, however, is that the cards are then shuffled from scratch. Because then the #CSU is outside"
Strategy: Either #Merkel delivers 100% then victory CSU = Merkel + #Union broken. Or #CSU goes it alone + Seehofer holds Merkel Messer in front of his chest: his security authorities supposedly demand the same! How can Merkel instruct them differently? #AfD laughs.
