Right. That is why it is also about climate justice. https://350.org/de/was-ist-klimagerechtigkeit/‚Ä¶
"https://350.org/de/was-ist-klimagerechtigkeit/‚Ä¶ Climate justice means to consider climate change as a complex question of social justice and not just as an environmental problem, as a product of social inequality and an economic system that is characterized by growth as Is an end in itself."
"&quot;#Climate change could force millions of people to resettle, it says in a current report from the #World Bank.

It&#39;s about the same payment for work of equal value. The question is e.g. For example: Why does a kindergarten teacher earn less than a VW worker. Are children worth less to us than cars? And: Of course we are in favor of upward alignment. You know that :)
"The picture fits. Because in typical women&#39;s jobs, men earn less than in typical men&#39;s jobs. The lower pay for these professions is one reason for the gender pay gift. We therefore demand: Equal pay for work of equal value."
Is female work worth less? Women receive 21 percent less wages because jobs in which a lot more women than men work are paid less than ‚Äúmen jobs‚Äù. We demand equal payment for work of equal value! #EqualPayDay #EqualPay # Equal2018 pic.twitter.com/5SjaHEeBJN

"Instead of collecting what does not currently want to be collected, we should work together to strengthen the LEFT. Because the LINKE is a very successful collection movement that has the potential to continue to grow and become stronger. @b_riexinger"
"If we give that up for a kind of collection movement - for which I honestly don&#39;t hear much enthusiasm from the ranks of social democrats, Greens or trade unionists - we run the risk that the left will be weakened. @b_riexinger"
"But it&#39;s not about becoming like the old or the new social democracy. As LEFT we have a different core, a broader perspective. We want a different social model that real democracy realizes. @b_riexinger"
"The idea that the poorest are threatening our prosperity and not the richest is wrong. Wealth is divisible. Our solidarity includes everyone affected by neoliberalism: employed, refugees, unemployed and pensioners. @b_riexinger"
"We will enable an orderly, solidary and constructive discussion in the party. We will do this in the next few weeks with a number of regional forums. Because that&#39;s how it is with the LEFT: the positions are created by the members. @b_riexinger"
"We need infrastructure socialism, that is, well-developed public services and services of general interest that are organized as needed - social structures that ensure that everyone can live as well and safely as they want. @b_riexinger"
"It was easy to see from the diesel debate: Where was the obvious suggestion to immediately make the # public transport free of charge in all polluted cities? Then half of the commuters would immediately switch to environmentally friendly means of transport, driving bans would be superfluous. @b_riexinger"
"We say to the colleagues at @IGMetall: All the best! Two years is a start and we want to go much further! We are fighting for a new normal employment relationship, a short full-time job for everyone with wage compensation and more staff. @b_riexinger"
And the bad thing is: Neither the Union nor the SPD have a plan for how the upheavals can be designed in such a way that the employees do not end up paying the bill again. For us as LINKE it is clear: Whoever makes profits must not be fired! @b_riexinger #Siemens
"We have stabilized at 10% in truly difficult times, while the progressive warehouse has become smaller overall. Now it is time to think the left bigger. @katjakipping"
Connect and not split - this is how every real collection and every departure begins. So we stop playing the milieus against each other. Let&#39;s bring together what divides society! @katjakipping
We have had a parliamentary group in Hessen for a long time that does great things. I don&#39;t even know if there are still strikes and large-scale demonstrations in Hessen without the left-wing parliamentary group and specifically @Janine_Wissler. @katjakipping
2018 will be an important year for the LINKE. In Bavaria it is high time for a left-wing opposition in the state parliament. A #CSU that competes with the #AfD for a right-wing abomination simply needs a left headwind - even in parliament. @katjakipping
"As a party on the move, we should try to lift the dividing line. It is up to us to bring together what constantly divides this capitalist society. @katjakipping"
"The electoral successes of the right have changed the climate. The inhibition threshold for racist outbreaks of violence has dropped significantly. On average, there is at least one attack on the life and limb of refugees every day. Our party opposes it. @katjakipping"
"If there are to be new left-wing majorities, then this is only possible via a LEFT, which is larger and more powerful. So we rely on our strength as an active member party. @katjakipping"
"We are the social opposition from the left in the Bundestag. That doesn&#39;t answer all of our questions, but it&#39;s important. Because there is currently no left progressive warehouse. @katjakipping"
"The way in which two people&#39;s parties, which have become sluggish, distribute power leads to a dissatisfaction with democracy. The #GroKo is a government of the losers. In a vibrant democracy, after elections, those who won should rule, not two losers. @katjakipping"
Now the party starts the year with the party leaders @katjakipping and @b_riexinger: https://www.facebook.com/linkspartei/videos/10154881015020683/?notif_id=1515834282710428¬¨if_t=live_video_explicit‚Ä¶
