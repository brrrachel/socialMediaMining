"@tweecix @Scheidungstipps @fdpbt An international declaration of intent for a balanced handling of migrants and migration, as is the migration pact is good and important. More important for Germany to control asylum and immigration at last by national, transparent legislation."
"@tweecix @fdpbt @fdp D meets the standards formulated in #Migrationspakt now. Also why the migration pressure is so high. Would be others, as many countries are committed to certain standards, which would reduce the pressure. As for the IQ: Stay but please objectively."
@medbuer @fdpbt global standards applicable in our view about human rights protection of migrants and the global challenge of migration coordinated to face the right way. To provide an impetus is concern of the UN Migration Pact. We support that.
@shirisreeli @DrKassandraPari @fdpbt D already meets the constitutional standards that formulated the migration pact in its policies and objectives. A worldwide achievement of specific standards is appropriate to limit the migration flows to Germany and Europe and to submit clear rules.
"@mngsra @fdp @fdpbt Migration is a global problem that requires a global response. The pact with its recommendations is making an initial approach. In D, the recommendations have already been met. There is little reason to be against it. What we really need is an immigration law!"
Global standards for migrants - as they already are here - protect migrants and reduce the migration pressure on D. The @fdpbt supports the #Migrationspakt. but he does not release the #GroKo of the urgent need to finally submit a #Einwanderungsgesetz. https://t.co/0ngrRxXxae
@Momimausilein @fdpbt Unfortunately you may have right about the voting behavior ...
@AlexPrStgt @fdpbt These doubts I have. The Union has promised during the election campaign in 2017 to abolish the solos and to relieve the middle class in income tax. The SPD had a flattening of the medium-sized belly in the program. what has happened so far: nothing.
@ Journalist262 @Diplo_Peter @ThomasOppermann @MOFAUAE @LangeMdB @berlinliebich @UAE_Berlin @GermanEmbUAE you mean the UN migration pact? In tomorrow we will have a debate in the Bundestag. Of silence can be no question.
