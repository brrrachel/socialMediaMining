@Volker_Beck Excuse me: with the many defamations we can hardly keep up ... we do NOT incite Islam! See election program.
"@Volker_Beck We already have that! Isn&#39;t Mr. Sarrazin SPD, Mr. Beck? Are all right who disagree with you?"
@Volker_Beck Why not on the election program? Isn&#39;t discussion the basis of democracy?
@Volker_Beck Not true: Anyone who becomes a member must provide information - those who answer untrue are excluded. Already happened.
"@Volker_Beck Please refer to our election program, not media statements. We can hardly influence them."
@Volker_Beck That is not true: we delimit ourselves. We are overrun at the moment and can hardly keep up. What does PI mean? What exactly is right?
@Volker_Beck Why exactly do you call us right-wing populist?
