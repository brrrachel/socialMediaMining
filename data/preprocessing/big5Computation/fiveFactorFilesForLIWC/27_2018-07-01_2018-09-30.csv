You finally have to open something and escape your tunnel vision.
Earlier dictators could not have relativized the curtailment of freedom of expression better!

The AfD has only emerged from the observation of the other parties and their political failures.

You mean the Greens were active again?
1. What sexuality exactly now? 2. When and how much tax should I have paid?
"But tell me, the &quot;intelligent&quot; in your name here is pure mockery !?"
Of course we have suggestions and they would work too. They just don&#39;t like multi-cultural chaos and haters of Germany.
What exactly should I judge?
"Oh so ... because the comment or post is not directed against the people you hate, is it a &quot;hate comment&quot;? Nonsense."
"I wrote about migrant groups, which can include the perpetrator with a &quot;German passport&quot;. Forget it, it was another typical left-wobbly attempt to deny the truth."
"Daily individual cases are &quot;generalization&quot;? Do you actually still notice what you are saying about yourself? And no, &quot;turnip off&quot; is more likely to come from your Islamic buddies, we just want to send these chaots back to where they come from. Home!"
So your aluminum hat is a complete suit? Just as you refuse to perceive daily # individual cases.
"Oh, pointing out and criticizing such violent crimes is a &quot;hate comment&quot;? Does that apply in general or only for the reference to crimes with a migration background? And would the criticism of arson in an asylum home also be a hate comment?"
Iraqis according to other reports ...
"Everyday newest serious crimes by migrant groups. It is getting worse, the total (left) political failure is becoming clearer every day.

"Which ‚Äúright-wing extremist‚Äù, that is, at least the party observed by the US, do you mean exactly? Or can it be that you just didn&#39;t know what you were talking about?"

"No, it&#39;s out."
Well at least she&#39;s hit it hard! #linksbillig
"What do you write again for a stupid left-wing rubbish. You don&#39;t know how to help yourself anymore, right? We said that firearms use is a matter of course for authorities in the event of violent invaders. Just as it is also regulated by law."
Neither.
"No, but criticism of violent, illegal immigrants is. And since when have left wing dictators dictated what is opinion and what is not?"
"Yes, he was. 22 years self-employed, bought estate without loan, trained in 2 professions, never been bankrupt or insolvent. Think that fits, right?"
"Firstly, I never faced bankruptcy, or can you name any process opening, and secondly, how do you figure out that I wanted to evade taxes? And do you realize that such wild claims can be very expensive for you?"
Is it &quot;pointless&quot; just because it doesn&#39;t fit into your contorted mindset? But that&#39;s very left-flat!
"Are you talking about differentiation like that between national and nationalistic? Or between center-right and #Nazi etc.? Yes, you should start."

"Nice that you notice the nonsense! There is always talk of # individual cases of violence against foreigners, even though they take place on a daily basis."
"For us there were and are, of course, &quot;real refugees&quot;. A vanishingly small number of immigrants who also suffer from left-wing politics."
"And yet it is exaggerated and the term is used over inflation. Bad, you&#39;re right."
"Take a look at the Duden, it&#39;s about biological characteristics."
"You cannot reach Mr. Harr here, you have to understand. And to fight supposed fascism with fascist methods means: fascism! Left-wing chaots just don&#39;t understand."
Left is legitimate but does not correspond to my opinion and harms our country and its people. The constant incantation: right = Hitlerism - would also mean: left = Stalinism and Maoism. They don&#39;t understand ...
"The exaggeration and falsification of the term racism is not democratic, but leftist propaganda."
Make it clear everywhere that #metwo is only multi-cultural propaganda and real racism is clearly defined in the Duden.
You should be able to distinguish so many things. Also real refugees from economic refugees or illegal immigrants.
I have several ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a migration background. We also have a lot of members with a migration background!
Clearly defined in the Duden.
"But no, at most criticizing with reference to daily, unfortunately real # individual cases."
And now you have also convinced the last of your left-handedness.
"You should open up more ... Well, everyone as he wants and can."
"Generally inhumane just because I don&#39;t like YOUR highly criminal favorites? Nonsense, you notice yourself, yes?"
As long as you can still laugh at your inability to make comments ...
"You can only fecal, right?"
"Well, I definitely don&#39;t touch your left-wing populism."
Does an intolerant left-wing fascist say?
And you want to be able to judge that?
Why not?
"Maybe, but why are you so full of me? I totally reject Hitlerism. Just like Stalinism or Maoism, don&#39;t you?"
Just because I don&#39;t love your highly criminal immigrants (next ones)?
And was that all?
What is the left stammer now? Something taken over when trying to justify your own senseless comment?
Why please? Are you a bit of a racist?
Did you just want to prove your left-handedness? It worked.
"You are not blessed enough spiritually to be able to grasp the difference yourself, yes? Then help: the ‚Äúrefugee‚Äù or illegal immigrant can DECIDE for himself whether he wants to be smuggled or not, the animal in the parked car obeys his master and has no choice."
Yes yes ... the shift to the left has lost momentum and now it is back to normal because people wake up and the truth can be told again.
No why? Explain times.
They may park their bikes in the shade and the dogs run away howling. Another stupid stupid red-green commentary.
So where you are right ... üòâ
"It can of course not be documented at all, since it is fictitious and simple (left) agitation, as (almost) always. So again: ZERO substance"
"How do you come up with this? 1. If a lot more AfD offices are attacked by left wing scholars than vice versa 2. Let&#39;s categorically reject something, no matter by whom and against whom 3. You have completely missed it, please contact the right and left wing with it."
"1. Offenses are not &quot;okay&quot; no matter where they come from. 2. We always say that lighting and self-lighting in asylum homes should be completely rejected. 3. Here it was not against &quot;film&quot; but Trump, who does not recognize the political context ..."
"Have already looked in the post to America, right? If you get out of your unreal left bladder first, then we can continue talking."

Brainless agitation and insult is more your comment!

How do you think the AfD wants to &quot;shoot down&quot; refugees? Left-wing stupid propaganda again?

"Either way, he &quot;didn&#39;t make it&quot;. But you probably know this well enough."
"And the left-wing stupid and intolerant whine of the multi-cultural gossip also annoys Germany and Europe every day. Finally get used to real national politics, far from unreal social experiments."
Oh? You have a strange understanding of history ...
"Yes, over centuries and through the process of secularization! But I don&#39;t want Germany to become the test field for an equally long process in Islam!"
"Oh, I&#39;m supposed to be bankrupt? Where did you get this &quot;info&quot; from and which court found my &quot;bankruptcy&quot;?"
"It wasn&#39;t even cheaper, was it?"
"There are always people who just don&#39;t want to recognize it before it&#39;s too late, just like back then ..."
"You want to see Islam spread here, but we are the eternal yesterday? üòÇ"
"1. I don&#39;t hate 2. Yes, the Bible also contains paragraphs that did not conform to the GG, BUT Christianity has undergone its change (secularization etc.) for centuries, Islam does not"

Justified criticism is baiting for you? Are you a Stalinist or something?

We now all know that nothing becomes ‚Äúclear‚Äù to you and that you live fully in your left anarcho bubble.
Exactly ... are not just daily facts.
Which AfDers are supposedly supposed to rape and stab with knives every day?
Are a disproportionate number of migrants ... Did you mean that?
All of which have been withdrawn and are therefore irrelevant to this ...
"Yes, trouble with the law and targeted by prosecutors because left-wing ads are constantly hailing. I have already been rejected hundreds of ads without any process. That is of course not in the article."
Which &quot;right-wing lies&quot; exactly? So what was a lie please?
"Well, you only read and hear what you want, typically left-wing."
But only in your sunstroke-driven dreams.
"And their peers have nothing else to offer the Germans other than daily # individual cases, identity failures and payment management for Europe. Great left performance!"
I honestly say what I mean: Germany out of the Germans - seriously criminal foreigners.
Says a left-wing cheater? It&#39;s too funny.
"Now, however, the Dresden public prosecutor&#39;s office has already rejected all the notifications in the preliminary examination and found that there was neither an insult nor incitement on my part. What allegedly racist statements do you mean exactly?"
In Germany and Europe.
What exactly did &quot;Italy&quot; do?
Oh? Which one exactly?
Why do you call Libya &quot;hell&quot;? Do you have no respect for foreign countries and peoples? Can you only measure everything against German standards and do other things badly? Are you a bad racist?
Oh you will not understand so much ...
You seem rather shameful and shamelessly uninformed! How long have I been the &quot;authority&quot;?

Oh? Why do you think that?
"Franziska Schreiber did not get any further in the #AfD, could not make a career, only worked in our AfD group for a few months in 2016, as a Petry supporter it was all over after she left and now she contemptuously follows the press, nothing more. https://m.bild.de/bild-plus/politik/inland/alternative-fuer-deutschland/diese-frau-packt-aus-56460946,view=conversionToLogin.bildMobile.html?ref=fbpa‚Ä¶"
Typical left-hand simplicity ...
The next tweet will be as true as this one. Another question is whether it will match your left tunnel vision.
"What are you writing for left garbage again? Of course I have a heart for people, for example the many innocent victims of illegal mass immigration or extremist acts of violence. Of course, these are usually the very people who don&#39;t care about their peers!"
"Please remember that having animals means having responsibility! Not only toddlers, also pets have no place in the weather in the parked car! #AfD #Poggenburg pic.twitter.com/H45z2Bagzm"
Does it feel good to rather hate the critics of the crimes than the criminals?
Where&#39;s your compassion for the victims? You&#39;d rather rush against politicians who want to end this daily left # individual case madness.
"But fighting crime also includes analyzing and identifying perpetrators, even if you don&#39;t want to get it."
"If people in Germany had thought that way after the war, our country would still be a ruin and you and your kind could not let go of your left-decadent nonsense every day! And those who actually flee from need and poverty do not assassinate in the host country!"
Combating crime also requires perpetrator and group analysis! But of course you have no idea.
"Did I complete and understand a minute later, didn&#39;t you look properly?"
How can a mere assumption based on experience be racist? And who was reduced because of biological characteristics?
And you&#39;re doing Klugsch today ... right?

What exactly is wrong?
"Why not? Then I won&#39;t let myself be smuggled on, I promise! Where is the Problem?"
"No, I didn&#39;t say so. However, smuggling on may be a criminal offense."
"Of course I look pretty good there, but the smear is left-wing agitation, nothing more."
"Well, let&#39;s say &quot;ready to use violence&quot; is just an assessment. Rather, acts of violence and tendencies are more important. So don&#39;t just fool around left-wing, but a little fact check, even if it&#39;s hard for your peers, then maybe it will be something."
"No, nonsense. Why should 24,000 right-wing extremists be good? Are you a bit clever? Should be an expensive copyright issue."
"Obviously, getting locked is illegal! Sea rescue alone, of course, not, the forwarding to Europe very well."
"#Acts, please"
"Thank you for the offer, but I can&#39;t really keep up."
"So if you &quot;help&quot; a bank robber it can also be punishable. Of course, &quot;assistance&quot; can be a criminal offense. You may mean saving drowning people, which is of course not a crime, but smuggling them back to Europe."
"More and more often, the thing is also called by name: it is about smuggling, i.e. illegal acts! And everyone who somehow participates in it behind the fig leaf of #Seenotrettung also commits serious crimes. #AfD https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/fluechtlinge-mittelmeer-route-1.4066135‚Ä¶"
"What does the diagram tell you? Dramatic increase on the left, decrease on the right. Now we subtract 1020 propaganda offenses from the right (swastika smearings where often nobody knows who it really was) and we hardly have a difference left and right. Well, facts."
"They tell nonsense again. We stand against left, right and religious extremism! BUT: a lot is already being done against right-wing and religious ones, so we are tackling the so far neglected left-wing extremism. Is it really that hard to understand?"
And why are you so impudent to trivialize National Socialism?

The end is not near! There is AfD now.

"Then read the Islamic scriptures, evaluate today&#39;s Islamic (abominations) and see how Islam works in the countries where it has rule."
Something is slowly happening! &quot;Islam is not part of Germany&quot; - because it is a religion that runs counter to our values and our Basic Law. We don&#39;t want Islam&#39;s landmarks and symbols of power here. #AfDwirkt #NoIslam https://www.compact-online.de/volksentscheid- gegen-moscheebau-erolgreich-kaufbeuren-vergleich-wie-mans-machen-muss-und-dass-die-linken-schreier-auf-der- street-no-majority-‚Ä¶
"Didn&#39;t he ... You&#39;re wrong again, but you know that."
Where should I &quot;integrate&quot; into? In your left view of the world?
"How so? What do you have against this job? Don&#39;t you respect time-honored professions like camel drivers or cow boys? Is that because you may be generally reluctant to work? Or more precisely, are you perhaps a left-wing populist and constant agitator?"
"And not just that! Art. 3 Para. 2 is very interesting, against Islam and anyone who promotes its spread!"
"Yes, with the inclusion of so-called &quot;propaganda offenses&quot;, for example smearing a swastika, where you often do not know who actually lubricated it. Nevertheless: right offense."
"For example, because left-wing extremists devastated my business and private rooms in 2015 and turned my documents into &quot;leaflets&quot;? Maybe they were your buddies? In addition, paying late with fees and interest is not a crime at all. What was learned again?"
"Oh, where and when and how exactly?"
"1. Rigorous repatriation of all those who are not entitled to asylum and foreign offenders and perpetrators 2. Functioning external borders - European or, if necessary, national 3. Immigration law 4. No tolerance for further Islamic missionaries and parallel societies"
Art. 1 GG - human dignity is inviolable Why do we then experience such degradation of the Germans through the consequences of illegal mass immigration? Because left-wing contemporaries want exactly THAT in their hateful anti-German endeavors! http://www.schwaebische-post.de/1687992/
"Have you &quot;taken in&quot; people from the GDR? But I still live in the same region and have never ‚Äúimmigrated‚Äù anywhere! Well, let go of nonsense again, yes?"
"I never claimed and I don&#39;t think so either. Nice try, but ultimately just clumsy left-wing agitation."
"Not correct! Because 3. How did this come about and how can we prevent this in the future! And now you come to the analysis: which group does the perpetrator belong to, etc."
You mean the illegal immigrants now?
Could suit left-wing haters of Germany like this.
Are you alluding to the compressed troll claw? Why don&#39;t you rather count the likes to the post?
"With an Iranian migration background. I didn&#39;t write otherwise, so of course I was right."
here
The proof of your kind has long since been provided!
"From where to where should I have migrated? Let off the left stupid again, right?"
"There would have to be some first! And if there were, we wouldn&#39;t have this stabbing here."
"Of course one looks for parables in such crimes to prevent further. It is logical and has always been done this way. The commonality of the so-called # individual cases is also the act by migrants. Don&#39;t you want to hear, right? #LinkerIrrsinn"
"Well, I&#39;m not going to learn left nonsense either."
With an Iranian migration background!
Why dead end? What does that change about the slaughter?
"Of course there is something ‚Äúin between‚Äù and no, I don&#39;t just think black and white. But those who often leave left-wing agitation completely unqualified here are what I sometimes call radical left or radical left. Whereby I even differentiate to extreme left."
"First, take care of your comrades with # Nazi Tourett, you have a lot to do. Always in order!"
"And with your radical leftist attitude you count among the heirs and advocates of Stalin, Mao and communism? How many tens of millions of dead did they owe again?"
"Yes, exactly, because we are against left-wing social experiments, we automatically want a new ‚Äú3. Rich&quot;. You just can&#39;t get out of your previous day&#39;s thinking, right? Nazis and supporters of Hitler everywhere - of course only in your blinded soft brain."
Where did I say that would be a &quot;forbidden&quot; statement? Have you ever dreamed too much of the day instead of working? It&#39;s just an &quot;outrageous&quot; statement.
There are differences!
"When did I ever say left-green-dirty? N / A? Again just stupid left-wing agitation? You don&#39;t know more than that. Good thing, election campaign for the AfD."
Which words exactly please?
I sometimes point this out when I am asked about German culture. üòâ
But you lack some historical knowledge.
"Yeah, he would have chosen &quot;Die Germany&quot; on the left or what? They write a left nonsense ..."
"Yes exactly, Stauffenberg would then be a station clap and scraper from Germany, right? What kind of fabric do you take !?"
"Honor and admonition today. Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg had the courage to act for his country on July 20, 1944 and went with the last words: &quot;Long live holy Germany!&quot; Clear proof that patriotism and love of the fatherland are not the same as Hitlerism. #AfD"
You as a left troll also work with pictures behind your name !?
"Today we should clearly point out everywhere that the judgment on the &quot;broadcasting compulsory contribution&quot; is not only questionable in the matter, but also a shameful farce with regard to (nepotism)!"
I don&#39;t really have a ‚Äúfavorite animal‚Äù. I am a general animal lover.
"Constitutional judges and reviewers are brothers, which damages the credibility of politics and the rule of law even more than the judgment itself did. #AfD #KeinAbGEZocke https://www.journalistenwatch.com/2018/07/19/gez-urteil-verfassungsrichter/‚Ä¶"
It is even completely sensible and coherent! It&#39;s good that you understand that bit by bit.
"So I already differentiate between extreme left, radical left and populist left ... you with &quot;right&quot; too?"
Where does it say that I spoke out against Israel? That is what the comment referred to.
What was that mentally devastating verbal outpouring now? Just throw some nonsense around? Are you getting too little attention in real life?
"But you think you can make a final judgment about me? Unfortunately, imagination is all your education!"
It came about with a lot of resistance and I don&#39;t know if it could really calm the situation there.
"Where did I formulate &quot;against Israel&quot;? Again rushing without arguments, right?"
"Where did I supposedly formulate &quot;against Israel&quot;? Efficient left-hand weaknesses, yes?"
"Of course, with protection you are right, I just don&#39;t know whether the chosen route ultimately ensures more balance and tranquility in the region."
"I do not know whether it really captures the perpetual tensions between Israelis and Arabs, but I also do not allow me to make a final judgment # the facts lie bleeding on the street"
Clearly we have solutions that left ideologues and the establishment do not like because they mean their loss of power.
"Nationality law in #Israel! Even if I am skeptical about this law and the politics of Israel, I am now waiting for one thing in particular: the # Nazi accusation against Israel by German left ideologues!

They are rather deep red!
YOU are standing permanently with your constant agitation above politically different people! Then you and your kind are the greatest &quot;enemies of the human being&quot; !?
"The speech, which the public prosecutor&#39;s office declared neither offensive nor offensive? So what is &quot;misanthropic&quot; about it? Are you perhaps a little hypersensitive and left-wing?"
"And you have so difficult to tell apart sea rescue and smuggling? But criticize other people&#39;s minds, isn&#39;t that a bit &quot;stupid&quot;? And of course people can behave illegally and one can and should take action against this."
"As a district councilor, I have to deal with affected parents and the annoyance of the closure of special schools here on site and I have always worked. What have you already done?"
"What kind of narrow-minded nonsense are you writing here? Had political classes again? Integration is realistic, inclusion purely ideological - and, incidentally, not required by the UN convention."
I also wrote about &quot;clear&quot; turning away.
"It&#39;s about &quot;healthy&quot; people&#39;s bodies, stay nice."
"Again: YES! I was also at town meetings of parents of affected children and they, sometimes with tears in their eyes, scolded the left insanity."
"You&#39;re really the day before yesterday, right? You can not do anything other than 1933 1933 1933 ..."
Left-cheaper is almost impossible ...
"Of course! And spoken to the parents as a district councilor, loathing the inclusion and closure of special schools as left-wing madness on their children&#39;s backs."
Or your verbal effusions ...
Not bad! üëçüèªüá©üá™üòÑ
Don&#39;t always infer yourself from others! https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksfaschismus‚Ä¶
"But they have huge gaps in education. First inform, then criticize! https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksfaschismus‚Ä¶"
"And everyone who disagrees with you is a Nazi or racist, right?"
How do you get this nonsense? Had political classes again yesterday?
Left-wing radicals and extremists repeatedly insult normal people as Nazis and thus play down National Socialism. Why are they doing this?
"1. Why via &quot;DU&quot;? Are you in the right place as a ‚Äúport bitch‚Äù? 2. How should I know if @ralphruthe had lost the sense of humor and had to wedge out so &quot;racist?&quot;, Ask him himself."
Personal educational emergency? Then here: https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksfaschismus‚Ä¶
And what is so strange to you: https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksfaschismus‚Ä¶
"But no, I only found it so wonderfully intolerant."
"Just like me before, or how?"
"Another misunderstanding? Happens to you a lot, maybe even based on it your left view of the world?"
"Your peers say that - and that you declare them as &quot;everyone&quot; shows your complete loss of reality. In addition: the AfD consists of people, how can we be &quot;misanthropic&quot; there?"
I didn&#39;t write left-wing extremist! Some (political) education would do you good.
What exactly do I have in the article ‚Äúvice versa‚Äù?
"That is your extremely humble opinion, you may of course have. And no, the daily Nazi allegations by left trolls and spinners don&#39;t annoy, they rather amuse."
Don&#39;t you know what I would have lost? I&#39;m fine!
Is this the custom with your peers? Do not infer yourself from others!
My pleasure!
Not at all ...
Of course. The radical statements clearly reveal.
"Well, let&#39;s say you don&#39;t like ‚Äúour plan‚Äù for Germany, which of course doesn&#39;t include any social experiments such as multi-cultural, gender or inclusion. And also: you are on the left! But I understand well that you don&#39;t want to admit that."
The previous speaker did NOT focus on migrants being responsible for EVERYTHING. The leading question does.
"All good, clear sky, free reception."
"We demand: trainee ticket, minimum training allowance, strengthening and support master&#39;s degree and education campaign for dual vocational training and away from the madness of academia. But nothing comes from the old parties."

"Alarm call from #IHK &amp; #HWK for vocational training today in Halle: the government is inhibiting the work of the chambers and the companies!

Ah ... a left class pasper!
Oh? Where is that SO in the program?
"That&#39;s enough! This left-wing, constant agitation again. I have never asked for the abolition of the statutory pension. Do you really have any arguments apart from these lying stories?"
"I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;re really not interested in your &quot;rating&quot;."
"Why should I? Look, leftists really have more (free) time for that."
How do you come up with this? Who spoke or wrote about a country in Africa? Do you have reading or processing problems?
"Poverty in old age has long been a bitter reality! Instead of leftist social experiments and utopias, the money has to be spent on realistic social policies. After 40 years of working life, a basic pension of ‚Ç¨ 1000 must be possible. #AfD #Social Justice pic.twitter.com/frctmqOUe5"
"Nevertheless, you wrote garbage first. And have you ever been self-employed? And with you Linkschaoten have devastated the company and the house and you were allowed to collect your company documents outside again as &quot;leaflets&quot;? You are a stupid leftist, that&#39;s all."
"The fact is: no arrest warrant was executed, everyone was hired, I was never insolvent or bankrupt - so I&#39;m not a bankrupt - so you just dumped left-wing debris!"
"Well, there was already 24.3% in Saxony-Anhalt! You will have to pack at some point. A little tip: then behave respectfully abroad, pay attention to the values there, otherwise you do not want to have long, is completely normal!"
"Would you now like to point out the bad policies of the old parties, which has caused a lack of doctors in certain areas? I&#39;m completely with you!"
"It IS one of our biggest problems, as the daily # individual cases clearly show."
"Oh, the criticism of the sometimes rude and violent behavior of the cultural enrichment is &quot;xenophobia&quot;? You were just fresh in left-wing political classes, right?"
"No more arguments and now rush into private life, very cheap left!"
Well then please: where and when did I wish &quot;Biodeutsche&quot; or raised Germany above other nations and reduced them - THAT would be nationalistic. We are excited! Or just left-wing populism of yours?
Nothing at all if these people want to be German and integrate and assimilate here instead of producing daily # individual cases.
&quot;Hope&quot; is the only thing you have! No performance can be seen.
"You mean, like most leftists obviously think about rights? And if you looked at my profile ‚Äúevery day‚Äù, you would know that we have a lot of topics! First inform, then criticize, otherwise it will quickly become ridiculous."
So AfDler !?
"Yes we did it again with caraway traders and camel drivers to the Turkish Community Association ... mh ... according to the public prosecutor&#39;s office neither insult nor incitement to the people, just a Ash Wednesday speech! Any further questions or does the left-wing mind have to work first?"
Please come out of your left ideology bubble !?
And you limit yourself to insulting and rushing because your mind is limited? Am I right with that?
Because you are one of the left-hand tulips that remain eternally blocked the day before yesterday and wouldn&#39;t know what to do with simplicity without a boss (Neo) Nazi?
"Yes, yes, the red spinners have learned nothing and are violently haunted as they were in the Weimar Republic. Let us hope that this time we can prevent the violent brown counter-spook, because we have learned from history! No red, no brown, rather blue!"
"Yes, these are the methods of Stalinism and Maoism that you and your like would like to use as soon as possible! And that is exactly why we do not allow the left-wing mob to continue to be granted without resistance as in the past decades."
"Well, let&#39;s say it doesn&#39;t match your deep red ideas. But that&#39;s a good thing."
The left delusion: &quot;Multi-cultural at any price&quot;
"You are on the left again, so wrong, informed! We speak out clearly against violence and property damage as a political tool, always and everywhere. This then uses the left-chaotic baggage you are attracted to."
Who says anything about German and nationalistic apart from you? You have a radical left-wing tunnel vision.
So now the content of the post is not correct and you know it better of course?
"Very right ... @youngworld is also a left, Marxist organ. You should take a look anyway."
Didn&#39;t know that the AfD threatens or even inflicts violence on others. That fits more with the ‚Äúcultural enrichers‚Äù described in the article and also with left-wing chaots from the ‚Äúblack block‚Äù etc.
"Good article by @Junge_Freiheit on the frightening effects of illegal mass immigration and the left-wing multi-cultural craze. At some point Germany and Europe will free themselves of this scourge, we are working on it! #AfDwirkt #NoMultiKulti https://jungefreiheit.de/debatte/kommentar/2018/fussabtreter-der-nation-2/‚Ä¶"
"But no, this statistic has so far mostly been &quot;read&quot; very nicely ..."
"Who says that you can only practice the profession in parliament or in committees? A real politician also does this on the street and directly with the citizen! Well, nice try but completely wrong again, you shame the magpies ..."
"Exactly, you are only a professional politician if you and your peers fit into the stuff and not if democratic elections decide that. Problem with politically different thinkers, yes? Intolerant, undemocratic - radical left, that&#39;s you!"
"Now you&#39;ve given it to me. Efficiently uninspired, but nice and insulting. You are on the left, right?"
I argue with the namesake of the barracks. Hold the ball flat and drive the Nazi craze down a bit. One day they&#39;ll talk about what nobody actually wants!
"And so with you? Multi-cultural gossip and personal insults, nothing new, from where ..."
The picture was taken in 1942 and the barracks in which the left spinning mill was located is now called the Rommel barracks. The fact that your peers are now spinning the outbreak of National Socialism again shows their eternal affliction the day before yesterday.
"There we have our &quot;cultural enrichers&quot; again, who are really &quot;crime enrichers&quot;! The deportation of hundreds of thousands of social and criminal parasites to their countries of origin would be a real asset for Germany. #AfD #NoMultiKulti https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article179015304/Berlin-Menschen Quantity-attackiert-Paar-mit-Stuehlen-und-Flaschen.html?wtmc=socialmedia.facebook.shared.web#‚Ä¶"
"Are too uniformed to know that I was never bankrupt, but trumpet it. Do you want to be able to &quot;wipe&quot; pigsties? So even then you have no idea. It all sounds like a non-expert with a big face ..."
"But I paid with interest and fees, just a little over the deadline, so what? You simply have no idea what bankruptcy or bankruptcy etc. means! Some education would help, especially you."
"Well, you Stalinist don&#39;t get along with democracy, do you? And listen to downplaying National Socialism is disgusting!"
"So in my &quot;blue&quot; eyes, physically and mentally disadvantaged people are very well worth something, which is why I am there for integration and special schools. Inclusion is a left-wing social experiment and leads, among other things, to the closure of special schools!"
When was I supposed to be insolvent and which district court found that? Or maybe it is not true and you are just a left-handed rogue?
Oh it&#39;s so funny. But what do you know about my &quot;masculinity&quot; or whether and when I &quot;piss my pants&quot;? Maybe nothing at all and you just let go of stupid agitation and personal insults?
"Well, they try, but less and less fall for this leftist doctrine."
"So to understand: I am a shame for Germany because I have a French first name? ü§î My God, what racist garbage there is!"
"It is being discussed and demonstrated here and there on #Seeno Rescue. Sea rescue and first aid are mandatory, what is there to discuss and demonstrate? However, those who have been rescued must be brought back from where they come, everything else is illegal # smuggling! pic.twitter.com/n8SQs7TGO0"
"Then you &quot;believe&quot; wrong, it will happen to you often."
"That you are not ashamed of it is shameful again! Left arrogant class pass, nothing more."
Current VS report ...
"And then we subtract the 1020 &quot;propaganda offenses&quot; on the right, etc. ... Yes, we tend to have the problem on the left, well recognized!"
"Well now it was slowly handled differently, by the VS but also by the SGB, so we seem to have been right by the AfD ... Even if it doesn&#39;t fit left-wing incitement like you, of course."
"If you subtract so-called &quot;propaganda offenses&quot;, neither of them takes much. However, it has increased extremely on the left and decreased slightly on the right."
Where did I find it &quot;really great&quot;? Maybe I took it or how do you get it? Or just stupid left-wing agitation?
"They are not the same, but succumb to the same dilemma - the misconception that everyone plays the game, or rather the left-hand spinning, suddenly and at the same time. And your completely inappropriate arrogance looks ridiculous ... as a little tip."
Says who? A communist and a Stalinist?
But have you already understood that it was about the &quot;Rommel barracks&quot;?
That our army is increasingly exposed to ridicule.
Because you say left troll? üòÇü§¶üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è
"It was about the current state, didn&#39;t you understand the article?"
"Of course. It was a good man, valued by many to this day and the namesake for several institutions."
The attitude to the soldiery of a man who is still valued by the enemy to this day and is named after barracks and the current state in our defense army ...
"Thanks, the answer says it all! And after that, working communism would break out, right?"
"I only question &quot;defense&quot; on foreign soil, in all cases equally. Do you find this uncomfortable?"
Spongy suspicion? Take a look and you will quickly find what you are looking for. And ‚Äúarsonists‚Äù are more likely to be the ones who take care of the daily individual cases and isolate Germany in Europe.
That would still be our chance. So it could be a nifty defense strategy?
Then you know what you should do yourself!
"You should, the Rommel barracks is still called that today, so the comparison with this person is also legitimate."
"This state of affairs is a shame for our country and at the same time treason, because it tempted every opponent to attack our country! #AfD #Poggenburg pic.twitter.com/fC2iGNNv4d"
"It&#39;s just as bad. However, we see the increase, especially the willingness to use violence, on the left."
"I even want to believe that the left wing are just a diversion. Everyone knows that they are intolerant, violent and fascistoid."
Are you talking about the 41% increase in left-wing motivated crimes according to the VS report Saxony-Anhalt? ü§î
"But you and your kind have been stirring up fear of National Socialism, which is supposed to be lurking everywhere, and are doing cheap-left politics with it? Then that&#39;s different, isn&#39;t it?"
"Right, constant talk on the left. The countless ‚Äúindividual cases‚Äù are not so relevant as long as they are still called stubborn individual cases. Who says something against it is #nazi, always the same lyre ..."
"No, I think everyone knows the answer."
"And you are not ashamed of such crude statements before the victims and survivors of the Islamic-motivated acts of terrorism in Berlin, Paris, London and elsewhere? What are you just for an empathetic left-wise ... Stalin, Mao &amp; Co. would be delighted with you!"
So how does the left baggage always cry out for anti-fascism?
And you have once again really left-confused with something?
"Oh? So I&#39;m not laughing at it, I rather loathe people who are constantly fueling this whole wave of migration and only bringing about the victims."
But of course. You can&#39;t let the would-be moralists spread their left garbage without contradiction.
The leftists only prepared the way for the Nazis with their world communism craze and the rampaging ‚Äúred guards‚Äù! Form something and please think.
"Let&#39;s put it this way: Yes, we will continue to straighten out your left unreal &quot;facts&quot;. The country has had enough of fine talk on the left, it is enough!"
"If a left wing attest to me, I&#39;ll do everything right, thanks!"
"According to your thesis, a third of all prisoners are foreigners? And that, although only a tiny fraction of immigrants live here? Then this fraction would have to be highly criminal, right? Think something!"
"But yes ... we hear the cries of the victims of steadily increasing # individual cases! As you know, left-wing ideologues skilfully listen away. And we speak the unpleasant truth - because we have the &quot;courage to truth&quot;."
Oh? Who exactly &quot;monitors&quot; me?
The drowned people have their own conscience with their call for even more illegal immigration!
"Far-fetched? If your mere ‚Äú0.2 percent‚Äù causes such damage and fills the newspapers with daily individual cases, that says a lot! We owe it to station gossipers like you! #NoMultiKulti"
"That&#39;s the whole truth! And today&#39;s wannabe do-gooders and antifas are the stroke of people who ran without thinking at the time and who, with moral arrogance, conjured up the disaster. Shameful baggage! #AfD #GegenFaschismus pic.twitter.com/KE8seU4U5D"
"Censorship scandal over shirt from @COMPACTMagazin: &quot;Ami go home&quot;! For me, #Steimle is a real Saxon and a German, someone who still has a backbone, a free thinker, an ossi. Big mouth and a lot behind it! #AfD #Compact #Poggenburg pic.twitter.com/HrfTNJPuCN"
Lindner #FDP criticized in the BT grad that #AfD does not yet have a pension concept. It&#39;s a good thing that on the last weekend on the BPT the application of the &quot;wing&quot; on the social question was brought in and accepted!
Correct: &quot;Some borders ensure peace&quot; - that is exactly why we are calling for a secure external border against illegal mass immigration. You understood it!
And here is another red Kasper.
This is more likely to apply to you !?
"Aren&#39;t we going to get any further, factually argumentative? Does the left-hand mob have to do it again? #linksbillig"
It went well for half a century! Not careful?
That is your extremely humble left-wing opinion.
"Islamization with all your might !? We reject this way of indoctrination, Islamization is not a trivial offense! #AfDwirkt #NoIslam https://www.wochenblick.at/wissenschafts-nacht-in-berlin-uni-bietet-kopftuchbinde-kurs-an/‚Ä¶"
But we are creating a mood against these other party conventions.
We have never voted against holding a party conference of other parties! # Democracy
The government is responsible for criticizing the government. Ever heard of it?
"This is what intolerant rushers look like, who notice that their ideology runs away every day. # They only know solidarity in the sense of their globalist doctrine, these leftists do not know solidarity with the past and future victims of their multi-cultural idea. #AfD pic.twitter.com/CAXYsFXB8z"
Better than constantly boiled-up multi-cultural uniform porridge or left-wing nonsense of the whole asylum chaos.
To the pallets.
"No! We don&#39;t need more unqualified specialists, not even more economic refugees, not even more Islamization, foreign crime, sexual assaults etc. ... #AfDwirkt #NoMultiKulti https://www.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/landespolitik/integrationsbericht-integrationsbeauftragte- saxony-anhalt-100.html‚Ä¶"
"Oh so ... Then everything was different with Stalinism, Maoism etc. ... understand ..."
Because a left hollow bulb wants that?
Are you now addressing the small number of these &quot;citizens&quot; in relation to the very high number of acts of violence? And do you want to illustrate the danger out there?
"ECELY how some left-wing haters whine the criticism of another multi-cultural crime more than the deed, the perpetrator and the whole situation itself!"
"Pegida and identities are &quot;terror&quot;? Then you are taunting real terror victims who have been killed or seriously injured. You&#39;re ashamed of nothing, not even yourself, right?"
"Right, otherwise everyone who finds ‚ÄúRommel barracks‚Äù good would be ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù ... On the other hand, everyone who doesn&#39;t mourn Stalin and Mao is automatically with link ideologues like you - #Nazi."
"So they weren&#39;t demonstrating the right to protection and security of German citizens, right?"
You mean the Iranian-born?
Which terror or which Nazi should we applaud?
"You mean the &quot;guests&quot; side now, right?"
"And again the same reflex with the multicultural clappers. The people who stupidly criticize such an # individual case instead of taking a clear and negative stance against the perpetrator and himself, as co-responsible!"
"Do you get a &quot;wet panties&quot; when your gold pieces and cultural enrichment really go out of their way and assassinate in the host country, yes? I find it rather disgraceful, like the people who &quot;clapped&quot; this development."
"Should I be &quot;silent&quot; on my profile? You don&#39;t have any other opinions, do you?"
"And again #Individual case, i.e. attack of a perpetrator with a migration background. ‚ÄúGerman-Iranian‚Äù knife stabber injured some 10 people in a bus. We wish the victims get well soon and the multi-cultural gossipers an understanding. #AfD https://www.merkur.de/welt/luebeck-messer-attacke-in-linienbus-haftbefehl-wegen-mordversuchs- gegen-angreifer-erie√üen-drei-schwerverlelte-zr-10050416.html‚Ä¶"
"Don&#39;t tell such nonsense. Have I ever called a CSU or FDP &quot;left&quot;? Maybe as a fraudster ... I differentiate very well, but anyone who uncritically defends left-wing social experiments is simply &quot;left&quot;, that&#39;s it."
"Yes, we would like that from the government too!"
"0: 3 in your imagination? And we probably have different ideas about ‚Äútaking apart‚Äù. For me, rather helpless attempts at left trolling, nothing more."
Now imagine that. I have never said that swastika smearings or threats from right-wing extremists are ‚Äúisolated cases‚Äù. Read more - think less!
Where did something break up? Was there a bang in your head or how is the comment to be understood?
"Your tweet was not about the horror of such an act itself, but about the comparison with Islamic attacks, which raised the question of how serious the threats to the swastika are to be taken. I made a statement about this, stick to the topic!"
"It is of course not wrong, because it was about vehicle attacks."
"Also means the police. But we are wrong, of course, and the left-handers know all this much better."
"No, unfortunately the real attacks on vehicles by Muslims are no longer # individual cases. Or what were you trying to do?"
Where else do I diligently comment? Except for answers on my own page. Something left confused maybe?
"This is a huge mess of a spiritually smeared finch. However, your comparison and your outrage are limping! Because there have actually been several real Islamic terrorist attacks with vehicles - so the danger clearly comes from this side."
"Very left-flat. You don&#39;t like our solutions, in contrast to left-wing utopia."
Where do you have a problem? Don&#39;t you like &quot;healthy&quot; or the word &quot;people&#39;s body&quot;? Left MiMiMi?
Did you read and understand the post correctly? Please try again.
"But I was never &quot;bankrupt&quot;, bankruptcy or bankrupt - so far your comment is completely out of place and just plain left-handed agitation."
Are you alluding to Juncker now?
Maybe you&#39;re right.
Until then we should try it differently and give the police and judiciary a chance.
"But that&#39;s very different in the article ... Well, quickly point to others so that you don&#39;t have to commit yourself to the content, that&#39;s for sure."
"So that&#39;s your only concern, not the content !? Left, yes?"
Do you have problems reading or understanding? Read my post again EXACTLY and then explain to everyone here where the call for a &quot;right martial arts troop&quot; becomes clear. We are waiting eagerly.
"Incredible conditions and a declaration of bankruptcy by the judiciary in front of the left-wing, criminal haunt in Berlin. These conditions are the precursors for vigilante and vigilante groups.

1. What do you have against my nickname? Does he stir up your fears? 2. Why do I have to be &quot;tough&quot; when someone else is writing nonsense in a group? Please explain the connection. I think the only connection is the left delusion in your head.
"I never read ‚ÄúMein Kampf‚Äù, but instead I read the communist manifesto. So you are as wrong with this &quot;safe&quot; assumption as with your whole radical left ideology."
"I have no taxes evaded and therefore do not have to pay anything, very simply. Don&#39;t always start from yourself."
"Are you politically unqualified? As chairman and top candidate, I led the AfD&#39;s best state election campaign with 24.3% and 15 direct mandates. What have I lost there please? Maybe just left some stupid left-hand bum?"
"But that &quot;your&quot; Ruthe just started poisoning and writing such a Fascho rubbish doesn&#39;t count, of course !?"
"I don&#39;t either. But they mess up the life of others and, unlike you, for me it&#39;s not just about your own health."
"DON&#39;T you see it or don&#39;t you want to see it? We are by no means misanthropic, but represent more and more people with our politics. And to constantly call politically dissenting people &quot;enemies&quot; or &quot;Nazis&quot; would also be &quot;misanthropic&quot; again."
What is this fuss about &quot;gentlemen&quot; and Landolf? Bissl celebrated too vigorously? Then steer clear of Twitter.
So you did not understand it ... then another way: I am not in the least affected by this criticism of a left-wing radical. I also feel more like laughing than crying. But of course I would like to point out how intolerant left-wing tolerance preachers themselves are!
"Oh, had little contact so far, but an interesting thing."
"I&#39;m a big animal lover, so I also like ducks. It also means: duck good - all right, right?"
"Well finally! First clear departure from the completely failed inclusion madness. Special schools are protected and supported again, children are neither overloaded nor underused.

What exactly did you not understand?
Just wanted to adapt to the good-skinned people ... wrong again. So only they can.
Oh yes ... but the fact that politicians are allowed to be satirists on Ash Wednesday doesn&#39;t count anymore ...
You are completely wrong and just follow dull anti-AfD incitement.
Upper Nazi @ralphruthe? Is it even a shame not to have a ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù first name? And that proclaimed from the left-wing radical side looks as ridiculous as it is questionable. Is that left fascism flashing through? Everything was definitely just satire and not meant ... pic.twitter.com/VU5LXZUi3G
I have never &quot;tumbled&quot;. Even if you remember it from your bad left dreams.
If you want to trivialize National Socialism !?
Do not infer yourself from others!

"I or we have never relativized the Holocaust! What are you telling left-wing insolent nonsense here? However, you downplay the horror and uniqueness of National Socialism by calling politically dissenting people today as National Socialists!"

You trivialize National Socialism! Disgusting.

"Oh yes, I answer something ‚Äúsimple‚Äù because I want to adapt to the level of the relevant comments to better understand them. How else do you want to react to leftist agitation, personal insults and # Nazi accusations. Still, I don&#39;t just &quot;use&quot; it. #Anstand"
Do not always draw conclusions from your own ideology!
So the unreal beautification of the world is now rather the thing of constantly left-handed enchanted people and multi-cultural gossipers!
"According to the &quot;logic&quot;, we could completely abolish the army, right?"
"It was not about the personal ‚Äúorientation‚Äù of the individual soldier, but rather about ridiculing the entire unit through politically wanted and publicly presented transenas. First think something before the motzen."
"But no, it is the shift to the left that has lasted for decades, with results such as street battles at the G20, acts of terrorism such as in Berlin and daily individual cases due to multiculturalism at any price. We need #right pressure to normal again."
"You mean now like your paranoia before the 4th Reich, which is constantly on the brink of eruption? You&#39;re one of the day before yesterday, too? That&#39;s right, it&#39;s not very constructive."
Are you now talking about the namesake of the barracks concerned? And what is supposedly wrong with our &quot;ideology&quot;?
Oh there are so many things you don&#39;t understand. Education helps!
"By the way, of course we think a lot about Stauffenberg. What is this stupid and completely nonsensical agitation, please?"
So that one gets sick? Why do you have to exaggerate everything new to the point of vomiting and then be surprised by criticism?
"Strangely, when I see reports about the US Army, it is always about the latest weapon technology, powerhouse and deterrence - I have never heard of politically staged transexual spectacles from there ..."
Very well-founded and reasoned left comment!
&quot;Any figurehead&quot; - you are not talking about the namesake of the barracks concerned and can not understand that I chose this good man as a comparison?
Which GG article am I allegedly violating?
1. Who did I ‚Äútake‚Äù? 2. Perhaps since politicians with formulations like ‚Äúpack‚Äù or ‚Äúon the face‚Äù have been regarded (and should be regarded as serious)?
"I have shown the namesake of the barracks concerned as a positive example. But you probably didn&#39;t strap that at all ... left, right?"
"You can even assume for sure, not just &quot;believe&quot;."
"It was 1. in the media before, because I found out about it and 2. something has to be made public and criticized if you want to prevent something else."
"Exactly, and talk in Arabic !? You also learned to tie the shoes yourself very late, right?"
"So you determine who is a professional politician and who is not? Doesn&#39;t that determine the voters and the election? In your extremely humble opinion, professional politicians are certainly only full professionals like Roth, Nahles &amp; Co., right? You have a clear tendency to the left dictatorship."
"Right, you seem to be completely missing the line. And yes, something must go wrong in Germany to produce such intolerant link ideologues as you. But we&#39;re working on it, I promise!"
"Yes and? Arrest warrants are quickly issued, but all have been dropped. I was never bankrupt. The next time you have to inform properly, otherwise it will just be a clumsy baiting ..."
I am not an illegal immigrant. Nice that you understood that!
&quot;German citizens&quot; who speak in Arabic ...
"Can&#39;t you read + understand? COUNTRY OF ORIGIN I wrote. Now guess where I come from and where I live now. And then you think and start over, okay?"
Didn&#39;t you read the article? They spoke ARABIC.
But don&#39;t you mean the asylum homes that were ignited by the staff themselves?
&quot;A little&quot; different culture? Is information not your thing? Would you rather talk and drool on my page so that you get any attention at all?
The problem is that obviously SO will not happen and most SO is not intended to do so.
So you want to abolish professional politicians and perhaps also parties?
I think most of the time in German history we never &quot;came in&quot;. Your extremely limited knowledge of history is worrying me again.
"And left-wing spinners and chaots struggle on the Nazi day before yesterday in order to be able to prettify their left-wing attitude, which ends in systems such as Stalinism, Maoism, etc. An end to the shift to the left in Germany!"
"Since I have never been bankrupt or bankrupt, I am not a ‚Äúbankrupt‚Äù. But how should Linkschaoten know about business, they usually only know one economy - left mismanagement."
And we prefer in a blue world ...
What have you lost on the bridge?

I never claimed anywhere. But stupid left-wing trolls already know that the barrack in question has the name &quot;Rommel&quot; and is the comparison therefore logical? No of course not. Logic is not their strength.
The AfD is a wake-up call and the only salvation for Germany after decades of turning to the left.
"1. The AfD is not right-wing extremist, or do you have other insights than the VS? 2. The quotation mentioned is absolutely correct, by me and was also not classified as right-wing extremist, even if the left chaotic does not fit. 3. You are nothing more than a left-wing incitement."
"Well, and in some people&#39;s heads, the light never seems to burn, pitch-dark, so anyone can be at home! üòÇ"
"First of all, radicalism is not immediately extremist, and we also have an increase of 41% in left-wing extremism in Saxony-Anhalt, so we have to take care of that."
"Well, that&#39;s how it is in a democracy, not your thing, is it? A strict left-wing regime after Stalin or Mao would be much more preferable to your kind."
"You link ideologists say that, nothing more! None of us want to revive National Socialism, take a look at our program - first inform, then criticize!"
I want an army that offers protection and radiates strength to deter rather than wage war! What&#39;s not to understand there? What doesn&#39;t suit you? Where do you have your mind? Have you ever had any?
"You don&#39;t think so with bissl, do you? Two trannies are courted by the Bundeswehr and there is a lot of public relations work on them. What kind of statement is that supposed to be? It is not about the fact that there were two trannies on site, it is about much more."
"Can&#39;t make a useful comparison between National Socialism (and that&#39;s what it was about if you didn&#39;t notice) and Communism? ü§î But you already have a minimum education, right?"
Even a left-wing stupid troll should be able to understand that as a defense army you have to be DEFENSIVE to the DEFENSE.
"New main route of illegal mass immigration !? And left trolls keep telling us that there is no illegal immigration anymore. For a free Europe, we need functioning external borders! #AfD #NoMultiKulti https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Frontex-Chef-warnt-vor-neuer-Hauptroute-article20518182.html‚Ä¶"

"How do you come to speak about my ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù? Can you just rush, personally insult and not even stick to the topic of the post?"
At least one less than you!
And how do you come from my reference to rather disadvantageous conditions in today&#39;s army on ‚Äútotal war of aggression‚Äù?
Oh ... could we actually do away with the army altogether?
Then have a nice weekend!
"No, someone who has to leave such comments."
I only pointed out the state of the ability to defend and did not &quot;wish back&quot; this time! Stick with something!
"You mean because they have lit their homes so often? Giant mess! Like any kind of ignition, by the way."
The same left nagging as always?
It is treason of the country to shame your own defense army with ever new left-wing raptures all over the world instead of demonstrating and deterring strength.
I thought wrong. Think longer.
"We ‚Äúdefend‚Äù our freedom in the Hindu Kush today, don&#39;t we?"
But when it comes to the Rommel barracks?
If only it were a little make-up.
"I specifically addressed the present and yet, real opposition is also provocation!"
"Do you know that yourself, yes? So bissl left wimp, flaring cars outside and tracing mom without contradiction at home?"
"And your kind are the left successors of Stalin and Mao, right? How many tens of millions have they killed? ü§î"
"But no, I&#39;m more proud to be an AfDler and to be among those who have finally declared war on the shift to the left in Germany in recent years. Nobody can hear the stupidly exaggerated racism and Nazi abuse."
And especially with left-motivated crimes!
What old Nazi slogans do we have in our program? ü§î
Let&#39;s say: your left-ill mind doesn&#39;t like it! Voices do it.
Right! That is why intolerant left-wing fascism must be stopped today!
"If you don&#39;t need a glass ball, a minimum of reason is enough."
Nazi regime? Just because you are fighting against illegal immigration and daily attacks by foreigners and growing left-wing extremism? So do you trivialize National Socialism in its uniqueness through cheap inflation?
"Oh? Such a person was, for example, Ernst Th√§lmann ... he would be insulted by his kind as a Nazi today with his clear commitment to people and nation! Your lying left ideology is just pitiful, off to the rubbish heap of history!"
"What mischief do we supposedly conjure up, simply because we demand greater participation by the people and reject illegal immigration by largely outrageous and violent people?"
Says a left-wing station clap who is responsible for the many abuses and victims? Shameful!
Does a left troll and persecutor say?
And we&#39;re not interested in your stupid left-wing talk either ...
Do you have a reading disability? Where did I write about daily Islamic terror? Please a little more education and less education in the future.
Neither! Not like your left buddies !?
"Exactly, and the whole Bamf fraud, the daily &quot;individual cases&quot;, the Islamic terror - everything is not true, is it?"
"But not yet, it is only increasing again through the AfD! Finally, there is a #state party again, one likes to see that abroad."
"What are your wishes here as a radical left-wing agitator? You and your kind are the real undemocrats. Preaching tolerance all the time, but not being able to keep it up. Fortunately, more and more people are seeing through this left-wing fascism."
Do you have a democracy problem? Or are you hard to get along with politically dissenting people?
"&quot;Upright against right&quot; - that says it all! A leftist class pass, no more and no less ..."
As peaceful as in the second half of the 20th century! What don&#39;t you like about it?
"And you also believe that communism works, don&#39;t you? ü§¶üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Left-wing fascists and unreal moralists have destroyed Germany&#39;s reputation in Europe and the world. Everywhere you shake your head at the German flagellation and culpability.
"You don&#39;t really get along with those who think differently, do you?"
"No, everyone withdrawn, nothing convicted and criminal. Disappointed?"
Are you saying as a stupid left-wing clerk?
"But no, more left-wing people, Islamists, economic refugees and a lot of criminal immigrants."
"#Altmaier: &quot;It&#39;s about the reputation of our country&quot; (ntv) Right, let&#39;s finally restore Germany&#39;s reputation! Away with the Merkel squad, here with a real, national policy in a peaceful Europe of the fatherland. #AfDwirkt"
But! Your ridiculousness beats everything!
"#Merkel speaks of a &quot;very serious situation&quot; - and means her own political survival. In fact, we have had a &quot;very serious situation&quot; for our Germany for years - caused by irresponsible policies by the Merkel government! #AfD #GoMerkel"
"Right, I can&#39;t argue with your arguments - you don&#39;t have any!"
Why can&#39;t the answer be nationality? Why do we have to take experimental reference to communism with its constant leveling? That is from the day before yesterday!
"Union in the &quot;final battle&quot;? Merkel has run down, Seehofer has played poker, now he has to show - #merkelmussweg The left-wing Merkel era is coming to an end. Long live Germany! üá©üá™"

I have not.

"Completely okay for Ash Wednesday, since other parties had not lagged behind in the past. # K√ºnstlicheAufregung"
"When did I ever march with Nazis who saluted Hitler, you left-wing dreamer?"
You need help? I like to believe that.
"You are welcome to stay where you want. However, they will not prevent the shift to the left from recent decades from being healed by a strong shift to the right. As a real democrat, you don&#39;t mind that we do it, do you?"
"If I don&#39;t come across as a &quot;lamp&quot; for left-wing chaots, then that&#39;s rather good for me !?"
"Since I have not been arrested or convicted, I am not a criminal. Linksd√ºmmlich?"
Yes and? Shouldn&#39;t the Russians speak Russian now because Stalin did that too?
What do you have against it?
"Because you are just stupid maybe? You have to slowly learn to differentiate between right-wing, right-wing radical and right-wing extremists. But I know, learning has always been difficult for you."
Don&#39;t we want to go on and on?
When did you dream of it?
And always the same stupid lyre ...
