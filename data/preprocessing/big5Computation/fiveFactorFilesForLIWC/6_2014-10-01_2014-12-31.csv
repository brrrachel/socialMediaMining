@ErhardScherfer my thesis: football is more important than a mirror story about kohl
@ Government4tel @ErhardScherfer there was more important!
@ Government4tel this can be interesting in the word
the mirror story about the minutes of the conversation with helmut kohl is very worth reading and interesting.
