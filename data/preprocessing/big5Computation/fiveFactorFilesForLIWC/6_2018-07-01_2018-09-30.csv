CSU general says AfD only differs in party name from the NPD. CDU parliamentary group leader Hartmann does not rule out coalition with the AFD. - Could you clarify your relationship with the AFD dear Union? Ideally with a clear stance against populists and right-wing agitators.

"The AFD took to the streets in Chemnitz with violent neo-Nazis. Union leaders are now openly considering a coalition with the AFD. Where&#39;s the power word from the party chair Merkel? Where&#39;s the stance, @CDU?"

It is perfectly clear to the SPD party leadership that Maassen has to go. Merkel has to act now.
I have made no allegation. But that&#39;s exactly the problem ...
Yes I do. That is why I am so grateful that such a strong signal was sent in Chemnitz on Monday.
It wasn&#39;t a joke for me.

"In Germany, they continue to go through a normal asylum procedure."
There are no centers.
"If there is no identifiable identity, the whole procedure cannot apply anyway. Only applies to the Eurodac1 group. Are about 5 people a day."
"It is an existing legal framework, there are already rejections (12,000 in 2017). This is about alleged unilateral rejections - without the consent of the host country. That does not exist and will not exist."
It is about checking where the asylum procedure is running.
