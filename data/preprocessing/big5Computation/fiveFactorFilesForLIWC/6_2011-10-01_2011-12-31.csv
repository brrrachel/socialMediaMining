@Alex_Mitrakas the planning is at 8:15 p.m. but can still move a bit backwards.

@hildwin where does peter altmaier say?
@BendlerBlogger that&#39;s right
@BendlerBlogger for 2011 there was no majority. it didn&#39;t fail because of us.

@Geywitz listen carefully!
@ Raketenmensch you are well informed
@ Raketenmensch of course damaged the SPD. I don&#39;t deny that.
"@ Raketenmensch unfortunately you have very wrong information. the CDU still wanted that, since we had long ago introduced a repeal law"
@raketenmensch @peteraltmaier is not true. but didn&#39;t have a majority until late
@peteraltmaier delete instead of block goes. Maybe one should therefore first talk about how such debates are actually conducted here.
@peteraltmaier had to listen to network blocking opponents incredible allegations and allegations. in the end we were right.
@peteraltmaier vllt you just have to take the arguments against vds seriously. today we decide on network locks. For 2 years ...
@peteraltmaier does the CDU wrestle with vds too?
@Schmidtlepp @mathiasrichel we will not decide on vds. we will reject them. I hope.
@mathiasrichel in contrast to @schmidtlepp and you can&#39;t sing either.
@Schmidtlepp @mathiasrichel three of us should perform wonderwall!

ui. Breakthrough reported at coalition summit. gives a new start again. looking forward to the decision to vds.
the article http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/erklus-der-piratenpartei-netzwaerts-1.1181574… from @HannahBeitzerSZ somehow fills my TL. I&#39;ll read it now ...
thanks to martin kind and hannover96. have invited 50 relatives of soldiers who are currently in afghanistan to the stadium today.
so what? @vonKlaeden: Interesting how former chancellor Gerhard Schröder tries to determine the SPD on Peer Steinbrück as candidate for chancellor.

at the association meeting of the district fire brigade in wietzendorf. uwe quante re-elected as chairman. Congratulations!
@Volker_Beck @dorobaer @peteraltmaier and I would like to ask why quellen-tkü / skype / trojaner shouldn&#39;t be in #uanm ...
"@kleinbenny yes, but I even understood the FDP so that it still needs clarification"
@hschmidt no household exam on Saturday?
it goes ahead!
@oswaldprucker at least not the topic
"@YousefHammoudah well, us too. we follow up. there are still too many open questions ..."
"coalition has announced that it does not want to advise trojans, quellen-tkü and skype on the new media committee. am amazed ..."
&quot;maybe a few things about the general&quot; - werner bartsch opens the meeting of the newly elected district council as the old president
weak answer to quellen-tkü http://bit.ly/st76CP - SPD will apply to invite skype to the new media subcommittee #uanm #spdnetz
@UllaRamone 79 and 80
@ criticism culture you never know with your government;)
in Parliament&#39;s Question Time. wait for the government&#39;s responses to skype #state trojans #Ozapftis
@NickLeifert @dorobaer what may be the reason?
the press has the information again before politics. annoys me: http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Politik/Deutschland-Welt/Bundeswehr-schliesst-deutschlandweit-31-Standorte…
"@jkahr&#39;s locations? yes, many and it stays that way!"
on the way to the Bundestag. De Maizière will soon join the Defense Committee and announce its site concept.
Bundestag now decides on tkg amendment on Thursday! I&#39;m curious how cdu will behave with universal service and net neutrality.
exciting fraction meeting. good debate. Heavy decisions.

@DoroBaer further away you can&#39;t sit
@DoroBaer @tj_tweets @petertauber @manuelhoeferlin @jimmyschulz @ walli5 at my end of the table it was bet that you would tweet first
the comments made by google representatives on pseudonyms did not sound exactly positive. do they row back? #uanm
@horax has a lot to do ...
"aigner has made data protection your topic?!?!? Facebook profile deleted, nothing else. #uanm"
lively debate in the democracy and state project group about swords and transparency #eidg
"@Nico hm, then go more to the people?"
@Nico I can&#39;t do everything. i have to take care of the internet. could perhaps prevail.
"@Nico no, you don&#39;t"
is there already #occupyenquete #eidg?
@NickLeifert @dorobaer @konstantinnotz the first success is already there: googleplus removes the need for a clear name. that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about
today #ff for soci-mdbs: @ThomasOppermann @UlrichKelber @jkahrs @KerstinGriese @EvaHoegl @LischkaB @schneidercar @FrankSchwabe @garreltduin
good contribution from @schneidercar in the SPD parliamentary group meeting. he has more idea than the whole government together.
we just wanted to sleep in @UllaRamone: Why do the groups have to start their meetings at 7:30 or 8:00 ...?
@petertauber I had no bizarre interjections
did not recognize mister uhl at bitkom # bpa18 today
