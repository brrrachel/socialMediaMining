@DerBruesseler @kieliscalling this reading is a little selective
@DerBruesseler that is ne idiosyncratic logic.

"Before the free trade agreement can be negotiated with the Americans, the surveillance scandal must be cleared up! Consequences!"

@ ge12345ge @MGrosseBroemer nobody should be happy too early; what Merkel &amp; Rösler &amp; Seehofer have delivered together - deselection?
@MGrosseBroemer wait-it is settled at the end-the opera ends when the fat lady sings-it says in the USA. She hasn&#39;t sung yet ...
@danielmack this good.
"@danielmack we also remain different parties, but policy change is only red-green against conservatives &amp; egoists!"
@danielmack that&#39;s not true!
"Fight @ChrisMichalak in terms of content = prevent through program profile yes - but the electorate should decide, not party strategists who are nine times clever."
Fighting is necessary. It is wise to be prepared for a lot. Tactical games underestimate the electorate. You should never do that!
Partial fatalism moves me. the Güllners &amp; Co. right on. Voting will only take place in September. We have a choice!
That&#39;s how they are !!! “@G_reichenbach: #CDU #CSU and #FDP voted in the Bundestag in particular against the criminal liability of bribing # MPs.”
Exclusivitis before elections does not lure voters. Fighting for red-green policy changes is the order of the day. Nobody wants a grand coalition here!
"Grand coalition is big crap and narcotic for our election campaign. That might fit Merkel, who wants to put the electorate to sleep anyway."
It is wrong to remove the freedoms we want to protect for fear of threats!

Because of a lot of feedback: I do not assume that pirates are politically close to the NPD - but I sharply criticize the joint participation in the process.

Fractional law regulates what factions may spend tax money on.
Kubicki &amp; Arp openly admit that the FDP and CDU parliamentary groups have paid government regulations on gambling law and claim that this is legal!
Was the financing of the black and yellow gambling regulations legal? Exciting questions for the parliamentary arm of the online poker lobby.

"@ArminLaschet the punitive self-disclosures, which are morally questionable, are then dispensable - that&#39;s the point!"
And the tax havens (= deserts of justice) must be put under pressure. USA shows Swiss banks how to do it!
@ArminLaschet You have to increase persecution pressure and thus substantially increase the probability of detection!
"Furthermore, it is no problem to differentiate between errors + mistakes or systematic tax fraud via money transfer abroad!"
It is a mistake to believe that fines deter millions of tax criminals - that only fears imprisonment!
@ArminLaschet Better they are snapped-paying and humming. Tax CDs and tracking pressure via media also increase the chance of detection!
The remains of our feudal past have been in the legal system for too long!
"Like confession, voluntary disclosure should only be mitigating and not exempt from punishment. Regulations can be found for errors and minor cases."
"The SPD has always been the backbone of German democracy, just as other parties have failed to assume this responsibility."
"What a nice 150th birthday in Leipzig. Proud and thanks to everyone who fought for freedom, justice and solidarity!"

Mitigation of penalties when confessing is okay - but buying a penalty just because you have the money for it ??? Tax CDs and fear of imprisonment help.
"As far as the punitive effect of self-reporting fraud is concerned, there is no other form of crime - this is unfair!"
There are no better arguments against the CDU / FDP tax evasion favoritism deal with Switzerland than Mr Höness&#39; interviews.

Good morning from Bordesholm. The parliamentary groups meet today to prepare for the April session of the state parliament. Plus office and press appointments.
@ Projekt108 @wolf_sti with the logic you don&#39;t seem to have it - my tweet said the opposite!
Falling height by Uli Höness is also related to his powerful verbal attacks on moral questions - he himself set the standard!
Neither glorification nor the general demonization of video surveillance is effective. Reflex-like debates after attacks are annoying!
What is not possible is to use the Boston terrorist attack for domestic political debates like the CSU likes to do!
A sense of proportion is required when it comes to video surveillance. In public places such as train stations + airports or ports this makes sense - otherwise not!

Mommy doesn&#39;t like trouble #tatort
"Even if Nazi criticism is unsustainable, the Merkel government is to blame for the bad German image. Kauder: German is spoken in Europe."
"Instead of being a people of good neighbors, Merkel Germany is unpopular in Europe as it has not been for decades. Politics of the economic. Boot."
What nonsense - only a lawyer can argue! “@Shz_de: Kubicki:&quot; NSU process is not a reality show &quot;: http://bit.ly/11FIcv2”

"Lively debate about the government program with the Jusos, now about an editorial visit to the Turkish newspaper Zaman."
"Now interview at Deutschlandradio Kultur on the subject of tax policy, then over to the Jusos in the Willy-Brandt-Haus."
"When it comes to tax evasion, black and yellow politics is more than hypocritical - there can really be no question of serious fighting!"
It&#39;s strange that FDP politicians are now pretending to fight tax evasion shortly before the election. #fail
"Apart from that, the commentator&#39;s opinion is nonsense: the majority of Germans are in favor of good work, fair wages, fair tax policies etc."
"Willy Brandt already knew that if there is a price to be borne by the government, not a social democrat, we should not want to govern."
Good morning from Bordesholm. Happy Whit Monday everyone!
