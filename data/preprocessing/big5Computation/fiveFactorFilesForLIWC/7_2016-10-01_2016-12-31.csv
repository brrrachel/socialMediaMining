Refugee policy: CSU wants to send boat refugees back to Africa http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/fluechtlingspolitik-csu-will-bootsfluechtlinge-nach-afrika-zurueckschicken/19189256.html‚Ä¶
"More security through more police officers, exhaustion + application of existing law + selective, targeted adjustment instead of legal gravel (t)."
This is just the right cardboard mate that socialists are allegedly against public security. We are only against exclusion + stupid laws!
99.9% of the refugees are just as bad as 99.9 of the locals. SPD makes policies for social cohesion.
"We do not stir up sentiment against refugees, but we are against resentment for security. That distinguishes Social Democrats from rights!"
"Curious, like me rights, who always caricature the SPD attitude, want to change the mind. SPD is not against &quot;threats&quot; against refugees."
"I wish everyone a happy new year and a happy, healthy and peaceful 2017! Make something of it! pic.twitter.com/S8XVkM6pAB"

"Happy New Year everyone! Enjoy those you love and show them. Happy, healthy 2017 Jahr"
There is reason for gratitude and satisfaction for many things. So I have positive expectations for the new year as a whole.
"Political hostility + criticism from the right, especially on the net, do not particularly affect me - they are the price for political attitudes."
"With me personally, the past year was generally rather good. Fortunately, the family and my private environment are doing well."
"Now an overall difficult year is saying goodbye with many challenges, sad occasions and setbacks - also good sides."
Good morning from Bordesholm. Yesterday evening with Filius at the traditional FDP price cat in the neighboring inn.

"&quot;Intelligent&quot; comments from the media &quot;One will still be allowed to say parliamentary group&quot;. The danger is &quot;politcal correctness&quot;, not intolerance + violence."
"SPD is also in favor of more police officers and workable return agreements with North Africa. Nevertheless, detention pending deportation remains necessary. https://twitter.com/l_petersdotter/status/813801027925344259‚Ä¶"
@L_Petersdotter We are talking about a small number of asylum seekers whose application has already been legally rejected and could go underground.
Detention pending deportation against asylum seekers whose application for asylum has been finally rejected is quite another matter. Protect communities from real danger!
"You don&#39;t even become a &quot;threat&quot;. Islamists who have radicalized themselves, for example, offer themselves as suicide bombers."
"Stegner wants deportation detention for endangered people NDR.de - News - Schleswig-Holstein http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/Stegner-will-Abschiebehaft-fuer-Gefaehrder,abschiebehaft148.html‚Ä¶"
"Again to write down: Rejected asylum seekers do not automatically have to be deported. Endangerment that could go into hiding, but it does!"
Union in SH has not understood anything again: Refugee families do not belong in prison. Danger with rejected asylum application already!
"What sets us apart from the CDU is that we don&#39;t want a policy against refugees, no general suspicion, no harassment, no detention pending deportation."
"Nord Union pretends to suddenly follow her in the right triad of isolation, deterrence and deportation, which they would like to have."
Good morning from Bordesholm. Time to do &quot;between the years&quot;. A little relaxation before the start of the busy election year.

Prudence appears to be a rare commodity in the political response to this terrible attack. Respect for the victims would be the least.
"Results of the investigation are zero, but Seehofer is sometimes calling for a complete realignment of Merkel&#39;s refugee and security policy"
The newspapers are full of coverage of the Berlin attack. Martial rhetoric of the Saarland Minister of the Interior.

"The SPD will oppose the tight legal course of the Union, which wants to redistribute less welfare state and from bottom to top."
&quot;Less for everyone&quot; - true motto of the CDU federal party conference. Not Merkel but Strobl&#39;s father-in-law Sch√§uble is swinging Union scepter.
"CDU wants deportation records, longer work for falling pensions, tax cuts for the rich too. Merkel Trojan horse for redistributors."
"If you choose Merkel, you also get Strobl, Kl√∂ckner &amp; Scheuer and tight right course. Deport sick refugees so that the people&#39;s soul cooks."
