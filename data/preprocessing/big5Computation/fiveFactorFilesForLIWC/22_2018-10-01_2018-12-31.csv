Günther Oettinger on Nord Stream 2: &quot;The truth is .. that the pipeline .. can no longer be stopped so easily.&quot; Not easy! His New Year&#39;s wish: &quot;A fair agreement&quot; with Gazprom on further use of gas pipelines by Ukraine. Very easily! Just because!
"How long do we think the topic will remain? Quite a while. &quot;Nord Stream 2: print from all sides&quot; https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/mecklenburg-vorpommern/Nord-Stream-2-Druck-von-allen-Seiten,nordstream310.html…"
I&#39;m accused of homophobia - along with anti-Americanism! - because you &quot;cannot be so completely certain&quot; that I use idiomatic English without mastering it? You&#39;re joking. I don&#39;t want to think of other alternatives.
"No, you don't get it. :-P"
I guess you're right. It is going to be terribly difficult.

"When you get out of coal in Saxony, you don&#39;t fight alone. It is a nationwide struggle. And a European one. Nobody knows what it will be like in three quarters of a year. Can you &quot;calculate&quot; that? With all due respect! Therefore: First fight before you reject the bearskin without being asked."
"It has long been true that governance is not an end in itself. But neither is non-government. And at a time when the once large parties CDU and SPD are increasingly failing, we Greens cannot be quasi automatically for non-government when the going gets tough."
"Okay, don&#39;t whine if someone takes your tweets seriously instead of cuddling. Who wants to rule at all costs? But how do you know what the price would be before the fight took place? You are signaling that we will never be so strong that the price could be right."
"The difference is: I was talking about &quot;parts&quot; of the Saxony CDU, not the whole. A little care can not hurt. And Kretschmer is not dark blue or anything."
"Anyone who speaks for Saxony in view of the reality of R2G does not want to make politics, but dreams of romances. Anyone who says you only make an &quot;ideal&quot; coalition or opposition is - a fund of Christian Lindner. https://twitter.com/fabiovelour/status/1076484035193520129…"
"I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about that. These numbers don&#39;t give that either. Without pushing back the AfD, nothing reasonably reasonable will be possible."
"If the question is allowed: Which coalition would you like to have? And, second question: Do we really want to play the coalition guessing game now? Can&#39;t think of anything better?

Anyone who has the damage defies description: &quot;After the election disaster in Bavaria: SPD promises ruthless excuses&quot; https://www.der-postillon.com/2018/10/bayern-spd.html#.W8SCz1Clk6w.twitter…
"Well, with #digitization, we Greens would have put more pressure together with the #FDP in the federal government than the Union or SPD are currently doing. Not completely unimportant."
"If the SPD could bring itself to take responsibility, that would be a different matter. But she is responsible and at the same time constantly thinks that she has to apologize or run away. It can&#39;t be anything."
"The most important conclusion from the #bavarian election result probably means: The #middle is actually moving towards us Greens; from center-left, from center-right and from the non-voter camp. For green, this means that we not only have to # open, but actively # reach out."
"# FDP-Lindner describes the 5.1% of his #bayrische colleagues as &quot;success&quot;. He can see it like this. But in the 2017 federal election it was 10.2%! In between? Lindner&#39;s # Jamaica Escape. Escape from responsibility doesn&#39;t pay off. In my opinion, this also applies to other parties."
Look at the numbers and face reality! 59% of all Bavarian voters want the Greens to be in government.
"Wonderful slip by Annalena Baerbock: In her statement on the #Bavaria election, she spoke of &quot;our top candidate Ludwig Erhard&quot; to correct himself right away - &quot;Ludwig Hartmann&quot;. She is right because Greens often understand more about a social market economy than the Union."
"Green vote share in the country side 15%, in small towns 17%, in medium towns 20%, in big cities 27%. Greens to be biggest party in Munich, the state capital. #Bavaria #LederhosenRevolution"

Hartmann: &quot;No farmer gets up in the morning and thinks about how he poisoned his fields and tortured his animals that day! It is the wrong structures that stand in the way. Healthy food does not come from a sick environment.&quot; # GrünMitDenBauern
"Ludwig Hartmann: &quot;We are not supported by our election campaign, but by the people of the country. They want a different policy in Bavaria. Our topics are well received. So many we meet have the tackle gene and do not want the CSU be prevented from doing so. &quot;"
"Schulze: &quot;Call everyone in the next 7 days, grandpa, grandma, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend, they should vote!&quot; Somewhat shy contradiction. Schulze: &quot;You mean that doesn&#39;t help if you call your ex-boyfriend? Then I might call him for you.&quot; Big hello! #VollerEinsatz"
