"@vzbv But in a different form. Black and yellow creates huge gaps for the warning industry. Better listen to the suggestions of the SPD countries, right?"
. @ Gerdbillen complains that the Federal Government has not acted on the issue of warning letters. 4.3 million Germans received exaggerated warnings # dvt13
@vzbv Our request for # financial market watchers is in the plenary on Thursday. Elaborated and funded # dvt13
@Gerdbillen diplomatically reprimands the refusal of black and yellow at the # financial market guard. Thursday SPD application in the plenary Bundestag # dvt13

. @ saschavogt wishes #jusosontour good luck. Thank you for your commitment. Hopefully we&#39;ll see you in Bonn # jusos + # spd +
vzbv boss Gerd Billen: Consumers are the really &quot;systemically important&quot; # dvt13
A rough estimate is 2/3 of the politicians present at the # dvt13 Sozis
"Siebenkötter is cautious: praises Merkel&#39;s statements on &quot;rent brake&quot;, but demands regulation &quot;rightly in this legislative period&quot;"
"# dvt13 vzbv head of the board of directors Siebenkötter praises working relationship with #Aigner, mind you not her work :-)"
"In the Bundestag, I am allowed to present what I want to Merkel&#39;s chair. At # dvt13, BKA searches my entire luggage :-)"
Commitment to the &quot;responsible consumer&quot; is not enough. The state must help ensure that people are not cheated. Agreement with @vzbv

"CSU parliamentary group leader resigns after abuse of taxpayer money. Not enough, get out of parliament"
"@Volker_Beck, that&#39;s outrageous. We have asked for a decision for months. Nothing happened. At some point a parliament has to vote"

"Why is Merkel disappointed by Hoeneß? Had it prevailed, it would never have been known. Or just because of that?"
@DerOwie divided. Throttling is a competitive decision. Preferential treatment of individual services is politically relevant
