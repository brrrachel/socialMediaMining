"I&#39;m honestly surprised, because I really thought that the black traffic light would hold out until the Bavarian state election in 10 months."
The result of the Bundestag elections has not changed for the SPD due to the long exploratory weeks and statements by other parties. SPD election tactics (a &quot;keep it up&quot; by extending the grand coalition) would be on 24.9. was wrong and it stays that way on 20.11.
"The SPD did not tact after the election and the bitter defeat and it does not do it now if the exploratory marathon of the CDU / CSU, Greens and FDP fails."
"Apparently, all four parties failed, Merkel, Seehofer, √ñzdemir and Lindner."
The situation for the SPD does not change through statements by the FDP chairman.
Jan Lindenau and the L√ºbeck SPD beat the Popular Front candidate from left wing to right wing. Jan Lindenau will be a good mayor of the Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck. Great opportunity for the L√ºbeck social democracy!

We don&#39;t even ignore off-the-shelf advice that is supposed to be blows against our party chairman (as we say in northern Germany). Keep cool üòâ One thing is certain: Martin Schulz has a lot of approval and affection for membership of the SPD.
"Environment Minister Habeck describes himself as an &quot;SPD understander&quot; and insults the environmental policy competence of the social democratic group. In fact, he is the best CSU understander. His own faction pinches and prevents vote by name on the glyphosate ban!"
"Green speakers egg in the state parliament and shy away from voting by name to withdraw from the environmental toxin glyphosate, so that it is not clear that black and yellow is wearing the pants in the black traffic light in this regard."
"In the black northern traffic light, glyphosate is primarily black and yellow! üëéüòéüáØüá≤"
"Greens wriggle around a clear position when it comes to leaving glyphosate. Black traffic light beats around, praises its own lyrics and does nothing."
"Readable article in the ZEIT &quot;The double Kubicki&quot;. It&#39;s about &quot;the biggest tax robbery in German history&quot;, political change of heart, mixing roles as a lawyer, MP, PR consultant and would-be finance minister (Steinbr√ºck: &quot;Realsatire&quot;)."
