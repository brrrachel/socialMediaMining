&quot;The tax rain is the only precipitation that evaporates even before it has fallen.&quot; Quote from #Steingart #Handelsblatt #fdpbpt
&quot;Wolfgang # Schäuble has no more assertiveness - just more luck than Hans Eichel!&quot; #fdpbpt

&quot;The fact that Germany is doing so well is also a result of our government work from 2009 to 2013.&quot; #fdpbpt
