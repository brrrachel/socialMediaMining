"Return costs of 137,000 euros !? You really make a fool of yourself. Why are they not transferred by two officers in a scheduled flight? Because they could &quot;resist&quot;. Then the officials shouldn&#39;t be too squeamish! Such a theater ... https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/abschiebe-von-zwei-kenianern-137-000-euro-flugkosten,Rddh9bX?UTM_Name=Web-Share&amp;UTM_Source=Facebook&amp;UTM_Medium=Link&amp;fbclid= IwAR2MDn9KMzj2ENmlVYnB907C1hQo7fiJnPZZPtfqafDttGwtVsV94BKnIFU‚Ä¶"
"Well, I also assume that ‚òùüèª"
President and the secretaries? But that was a flimsy attempt!
Left lump and common pest.
And for that we have to live with all disadvantages in the multi-cultural craze? Constructive politics can do this without mass immigration!
"Making nursing careers more attractive, meaningfully spending money in your hand, then you will also find workers here on their own."
Has the content become outdated?
"of course, too much is too much"

"You apparently didn&#39;t understand the sense &amp; nonsense of political Ash Wednesday! Totally disguised linksproll, as more you can not come across and now please roll off ..."
"I have never &quot;dreamed&quot; of ethnic homogeneity, because they spin something for themselves. But a cultural and traditional identity is completely destroyed by too much &quot;multi-culture&quot; and THAT is the left-anarchic goal."
"Well, maybe the result of a people&#39;s transformation is clearly visible and therefore a fact"
"Now # specialists from Mexico and thus the next &quot;protection seekers&quot; to Germany? We have already imported millions of ‚Äúskilled workers‚Äù and most of them are unemployed. Why the next swing now? But #people transformation? https://m.bild.de/bild-plus/politik/inland/politik-inland/50-000-pflegekraefte-fehlen-brauchen-wir-pflegekraefte-aus-mexiko-64855152,view=conversionToLogin.bildMobile.html‚Ä¶"
"Of course, the left - who actually want to stand against turbo capitalism - are working against the large global industry with its spinning mills. I only say &quot;energy turnaround&quot; and &quot;diesel attack&quot;. Only strong sovereign economies could prevent this."
"Of course, nobody accused of violating the law, right?"
"Right, but the reasoning is meaningful and a reflection of the alleged ‚Äúleft tolerance‚Äù. Leftists have always carried your ideology on the back of children."
The next proof: the supposedly tolerant &amp; good are actually the intolerant &amp; bad. How can you refuse to take care of a child because the political view of the parents does not suit you? This is again a strong piece of left ideology. https://m.op-marburg.de/Mehr/Welt/Politik/Weil-die-Eltern-AfD-Anhaenger-sind-Tagesmuetter-lehnen-einjaehrigen-Jungen-ab‚Ä¶
"Apt presentation of our protest yesterday in @COMPACTMagazin.

"Exactly, because I do not constantly shout other opinions, do not want to silence politically dissenting people with aggression and speak out against violence on all sides, I am not a &quot;stirrup holder and fascist spokesman&quot;, well recognized. This is more likely to apply to others ..."
"Oh sooo ... you can&#39;t stick to it, you have to rush against certain people. You are right, that explains a lot and is typically left."
"With the violent leftist terrorists? Of course, always too many."
