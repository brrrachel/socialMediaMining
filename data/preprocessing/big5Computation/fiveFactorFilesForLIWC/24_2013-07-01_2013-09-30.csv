"A flock of birds was just moving south-west here Hello ornithologists, meteorologists - is it already winter?"
@HaakonWarner Yes @spd @Die_Gruenen
Ok we change the hashtag: # snowstorm22 now everyone: #Snowden Mr. Friedrich # 22candystorm
. @ bensogut The Germans are just as little as The Turks
. @ bensogut nothing for you! # 22candystorm is like #gezi against #nsa
@tmmd not an insecure one
Somehow you are sometimes snores # 22candystorm: Friedrich declare admission for #Snowden according to § 22 AufenthG
"@tmmd @ dingler_g4 yes, and Federal Minister of Justice decides - no automatism"
@TravelbugDE so you are not even campaign-ready? Suggest something better than output and not copyright counts
Will we get a #candystorm for #Snowden and his admission according to § 22 AufenthG by tomorrow? Hashtag suggestion: # 22candystorm
@trebbianos so far there is no application in the legal sense that #snowden can make # 22 Admission must explain to Friedrich! #candystorm
"@ AndreR241 @ DenizAy2nd not only, but also"

@macarne § 22 AufenthG # snowstorm22
@olpen @TobiasHuch $ 23 affects group admissions #snowden is one and not a group
@opilef @RAStadler No because in the end the BMJ decides
OK  #snowstorm22 läuft Let twitter fight for admission for #snowden to Germany section /  § 22 of German immmigration law
@opilef @RAStadler why?
@udostiehl if I could. I&#39;m not a lawyer
@Hoplit_IT because you have to be in Germany for asylum. 1x1 of the aliens law
@TobiasHuch But I don&#39;t care if the federal government does it through a different legal entity. FDP / Union decide that - not us
@TobiasHuch single recordings run over § 22 and not over 23 for groups. What nonsense do you tell?
@WGulde and the American market us No reason against # snowstorm22 @RDiesterhft
@DD_UntermSand Are you the spokesman for the people?
@ AndreR241 @ DenizAy2nd we shouldn&#39;t leave NATO now - exposing SWIFT and PNR would be correct
. @ DenizAy2nd with your attitude we would also have marched into Iraq - Merkel and Westerwelle also wanted #Snowden # 22
@ s0720072 Green or Red @ creeky78 @Geekpirat
You are wrong @ThomasOppermann: Federal government has to decide whether to include #Snowden according to § 22 AufenthG. #today #candystorm
Chatter from #Westerwelle rightly + law when #Snowden is included overlooks the fact that ball lies solely with the federal government. #candystorm
@ creeky78 ultimately decides on extradition requests from Federal Minister of Justice @ s0720072 @Geekpirat
@trebbianos he has submitted a request from #snowden to the s. E. Competent body forwarded. #Westerwelle #heroes
