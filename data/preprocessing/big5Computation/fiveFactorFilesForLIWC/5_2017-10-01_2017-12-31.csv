Don‚Äòt feed the troll
"Central Council of Muslims, as expected, more liberal than the AfD. Basic problem remains: Glaziers not on the ground of the constitution http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/zentralrat-der-muslime-raet-zur-wahl-von-afd-politiker-albrecht-glaser-a-1175004.html ..."
"Well, if I now apply your standards of the 18th German Bundestag to you, it just hurts :-) Now Jamaica vote"
. @ BriHasselmann is missing something in the SPD application for a livelier government survey. Where is the Greens&#39; amendment? Instead: adjournment :-(
The @BriHasselmann complains that the SPD in a (!) Coalition could not agree to a new form of government survey and rejects it itself
"Solms with at most passable speech, age president, Bushman with snooty speech. Botched start for the new FDP faction"
It is very good that @ArminLaschet is one of only two prime ministers to be present at the constitution of the 19th German Bundestag
The @TSchipanski races with @petertauber and the AfD colleagues for the most non-factual tweet of the morning
And the first Nazi comparison of the new legislative period comes from ... the #AfD. The greatest critics of the moose are themselves
"My God, is the internal party pressure on @petertauber so great that it insults demand for a questioning Prime Minister?"

"An election law reform must come. But, dear @cducsubt, only with the principle &quot;Every vote is worth the same amount&quot; #Democracy"

"Thanks, by the way, @EskenSaskia is also a computer scientist"
Is of course also a consequence of the loss of votes. Many new candidates narrowly failed
Is your wrong message still being corrected? 2016 budget surplus in NRW
"Oh, do you prefer to talk about household designs rather than real results? Well then ... üôÑ"

Tuesday first session. I have been for the underpass for a long time and have made a financing proposal http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/Schranken-in-Bonn-bleiben-noch-l√§nger-schluss-article3630913.html ...
Incredible! Ms. #Strenz and the CDU are cheating themselves through a corruption scandal and are now trying to silence political opponents https://twitter.com/frankschwabe/status/921035173847863296‚Ä¶
Is Mr. Kubicki now ready to comply with the transparency rules of the Bundestag? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7ccvtwBwjT0&amp;time_continue=2‚Ä¶ #minimum requirements
The advantage of the younger members is even clearer: 142 CDU students between 20 and 29 years have 294 peers of the same age compared to #Bonn
"According to its own statements, the Bonn CDU has 2,385 members; the SPD in #Bonn now has 2,455 members"
Over 300 Bonn residents have recently joined the SPD. Result: We are now the party with the largest number of members in #Bonn
There are even bills
How long should Europe wait? Three weeks without exploratory talks !!!
Very good analysis

Listen: complexity theory and stochastics and calculation models are nothing?
That&#39;s the way it is
A really good idea: Study commission on causes of flight and how D has to change #flight causes tackle https://fluchtursachen-enquete.com/
Not correct! This is trumping when unfounded views are presented equivalent to scientific facts

Pursue: Punishment - Delete: Victim Protection
Exactly!
Better still: delete more law enforcement and hate comments for victim protection reasons
"Before the election, the Greens and the FDP called &quot;Deselect GroKo&quot;. And now criticize the SPD for excluding GroKo? #wieesgeradepasst"
From today the #Ehefueralle applies and I can be the best man in #Bonn tomorrow
And we look forward to you! Welcome
Many &quot;reasonable&quot; decisions have also been prevented
"I&#39;m curious, eMails again from Monday, the rest of the weekend belongs to the family. Answer follows"
@BriHasselmann is currently taking apart the AfD. Mettigel fraction. Dual mandate fraction. Without speaking in committees and commissions. # Mimimi troupe
"I&#39;m curious to see which AfD member will publish his income and expenses. I just say: double mandates and ‚Ç¨ 10,000 tax money for editing in the AfD group"
Results with other political prisoners shows that it is government&#39;s turn. But not in a flashy manner on the open stage
