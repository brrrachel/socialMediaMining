"Education, education, education. We will invest heavily in education. Free of charge from daycare to master + master."
"We make education + training free of charge - the training as well as first degree to master, master and technician examination."
We create a legal claim to all-day offers in daycare and primary school. This also benefits single parents and mothers.
"We will abolish the ban on cooperation in the Basic Law. Wherever it makes sense, the federal government should be able to help make education better"
We invest more money in modern schools and daycare centers - without fees. And we end the German patchwork in education.
"We need more justice, for example generational justice when retiring: https://www.spd.de/standpunkt/eine-gute-rente-das-geht-so/‚Ä¶"
We are increasingly promoting social housing - especially in regions with a shortage of housing.
"Anyone who signs a lease must find out how high the previous lease was. If the rent has been increased too much, the landlord has to reimburse too much."
We will limit rent increases after an apartment modernization.
Housing must remain affordable for everyone - even in metropolitan areas. We ensure fair rents &amp; put more money into social housing.

Growing old with dignity. Decades of work should pay off. Therefore we want the solidarity pension.
All people deserve the best medical care. With the citizens&#39; insurance we end the &quot;two-class medicine&quot;.
The level of pensions will not continue to fall. The pension amounts will not rise above 22 percent. No increase in retirement age
We will limit rent increases after an apartment modernization. We will increasingly promote social housing.
We do away with the solos and relieve small and medium-sized incomes. The very rich and wealthy make a greater contribution.
"Those who care should not be left alone, but deserve our support. We help carers - relatives and nursing staff"
"We want to make nursing professions more attractive. Specifically, it is about better working conditions, better income and better education."
