"don&#39;t keep Afghanistan as safe as the US, as Palmer thinks. Very well!"
"As far as I know, the Free √ñcalan flags are not. But only sometimes as a requirement."

Now @FaridEsack is preaching against the existence of the Jewish state. Whoever invites someone like that is also responsible for his statement.
"Finding: Article 2 of the Hamburg Islam Treaty is at least not implemented by Schura representatives, quite the contrary."

Ayatollah asked Ramezani what he said about the Iranian legal system with the death penalty
Ayatollah Ramezani criticizes that our legal system protects freedom of expression even with Sartire &amp; cartoons on Islam. #izh
How do Ayatollah Ramezani&#39;s words against the war match the Iranian regime&#39;s announcement of annihilation against Israel? #izh
Now there was also a hate tirade by Prof. Farid Esack against Israel #ihz This Schura Hamburg really has a problem.
and
Esack seriously demands that the idea of an Islamic state be accepted as part of the democratic discourse.
Prof. Esack may present his apology for the democratic legitimation of Hamas at IHZ &amp; Schura.

I find it strange when the podium on Islamophobia does not mention the #IZH&#39;s role in hostility to Israel.
but speaking the Iranian dictatorship is inconsistent with the basic values of our constitution.
