To develop my previous point: 1 currency means we cannot live with 17 individual policies on the euro. Need one single euro governance.
"@Migs_Bru in order to change, we have to strenghten, not weaken, common institutions: EUparl&Commission. Unanimity principle = weak Europe."
@Migs_Bru I totally agree with you. But for that we need strong common institutions. States alone cannot deal with intl markets.
@MalindaUnder no but we need stronger and more united governance of our economy. No to re-nationalisation.
@Migs_Bru There is an alternative to Europe and it's going back to Nation States. Is that your idea?
