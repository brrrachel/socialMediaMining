"(The order of this thread follows the arbitrary arrangement of the teams on the website, which changes with each shop. Https://unsere.spd.de/kandidierende/)"
The SPD is the party that can hold a drifting society together. We like people and we are the anchor of democracy. The SPD is needed. Today more than ever. These are @klara_geywitz &amp; @OlafScholz. üêûüëå https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFhI2xOSEA‚Ä¶
We want to switch to renewable energies as quickly as possible to protect our livelihoods. The big questions are: what is unfair in our society and what can we do about it? These are @NinaScheer_SPD &amp; @Karl_Lauterbach üì¢üåç https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNCGAv9sVfY‚Ä¶
The compromise with the conservatives is in our way. The SPD has to translate its stance into concrete politics. People have to be able to be different without being afraid. We still have to open a lot of doors for this. These are @EskenSaskia &amp; @ NowaboFMüî•üöí https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL85IMmq0WVlTc0gnHwl5gMw-qh28GK5Da&amp;v=KyYg8_FpQek‚Ä¶
The SPD must be reliable. Germany should become the most family-friendly country in Europe. We have to strengthen the social systems and see structural change as the East has experienced as a future topic. These are @Koepping &amp; @borispistorius. üíè‚õ±Ô∏è https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GTeE59t93Q‚Ä¶
Already in? Clear.
"The SPD must once again become the home of those who encourage and improve the world. Sitting less on committees, being more outside. Fight against poverty and for the environment. Forging progressive majorities in Germany. These are all @c_kampmann &amp; @MiRo_SPD üíó‚öìÔ∏è https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwWDtc8fk64&amp;list=PL85IMmq0WVlTc0gnHwl5gMw-qh28GK5Da&amp;index=3‚Ä¶"
"The SPD must be THE party for human rights. For justice, freedom, solidarity. Hartz IV has rule sets from which nobody can live. Our main task is to be there for working people. These are @HildeMattheis &amp; @DierkHirschel. üõ†Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-O4wvQcfQ‚Ä¶"
"Work and environment, young and old, city and country. The SPD is an AND party, not an OR party. The SPD needs to be braver. And it has to help people find their place in the world. These are @Gesine_Schwan &amp; @Ralf_Stegner. üéâüíè https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zOanD5teGs‚Ä¶"
"It is about more opportunities, more security and more justice with the welfare state as a partner. For example, a solidary development of care. The goal: Everyone should be able to receive good and decent care without risk of poverty!"

"They talk about great visions, finance, work, the environment and health policy. They tell of Willy Brandt, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and terrible boys from the JU. But her favorite topic, over and over again: social democracy.‚ù£Ô∏è Our candidates in the video:"
We are very sorry. But has been on the website for a long time and we have also announced here that there will be a stream again tomorrow. :(
"A MUST - yes! Price is not always the best way to achieve this. Reduction targets are contained in the climate protection law in a sector-specific manner. In the event of a deviation, adjustment is made, also through regulatory law. On the waiver: It is not possible that only smaller incomes are affected."
"2. Alternative fuels are encouraged. After a transition period, regulatory law applies."
"1. That&#39;s right, the approach can only be based on alternative fuels for shipping. In order for them to be able to switch to electricity and low-emission fuels, it will be cheaper for ships to use electricity from land-based renewables (so-called shore power)."
"Massive expansion of public transport, support measures such as the exchange of oil heaters, construction of 1st million charging points for e-mobility, promotion of energetic building renovation, investments in infrastructure for renewable energies, ...."
Especially people with little money in rural areas rely on the car. You should not be burdened with the CO-2 price without an alternative. Only affects long-distance commuters over 20KM.
"Yes, that&#39;s right, the importance of the topic and above all the serious threat was underestimated. In 2000, the SPD launched the EEG, laying the foundation for the change in energy supply. The coal exit law and the 65% target by 2030 are fixed in the climate package."
The proceeds initially flow into the federal government&#39;s energy and climate funds
"For us, protecting the climate and maintaining social peace go hand in hand, @tsghessen clarifies. #Klimapaket pic.twitter.com/97JRovCV5b"
"We wanted the tax solution and we don&#39;t want the market / quantity model as the only instrument. Clearly, there are uncertainties regarding interactions or technology developments until 2030. That is why the climate protection law contains the control mechanism with regard to the target path."
"The climate protection law defines the reduction targets for each area, and we believe that a purely market instrument on price is the only control instrument that is too little. The Climate Protection Act is more binding and comprehensive."
A price with the right steering factor means to achieve different behavior over the price that people who are often without alternatives are pushed into a waiver. We see the state as being obliged to create alternatives to switch.
"Exactly, 2020 will be the decade of rail expansion, the package includes an additional billion a year for the expansion of public transport. VAT on the train will be reduced, 365-day ticket will be tested."
"By showing our neighbors that it works. Whoever produces low-CO 2 products, e-cars or hydrogen fuels creates work and added value. Companies need predictability and reliability for large investments, many wait with good ideas."
Discuss with us your questions about and criticism of the #Klimapaket! üëá https://twitter.com/larsklingbeil/status/1177166042826772480‚Ä¶
. @ tsghessen on the criticism of the CO2 pricing in the # climate package: pic.twitter.com/e8yZ1BeC4k
The entry into the CO-2 price would certainly have started faster with a tax solution.
"Steering effect means getting people to behave differently through price. Electric cars are still very expensive, and a new heating system costs several euros. Would that mean giving up for the non-wealthy? The state must also enable alternative CO-2 friendly behavior."
It&#39;s no secret that we wanted a higher CO-2 price. But that&#39;s just one part of the package. Now get out in public and in parliament and implement the climate protection law that has been achieved.
"That&#39;s true. In rural areas there is often no public transport, here you can not just turn the price screw. The state has to create alternatives for the change, ie massive expansion of public transport and, in parallel, increasing CO-2 prices."
"The CO-2 price is an important component, but the heart is the climate protection law. Not only leave climate protection to the market, but also regulate in a binding and reliable manner which area must reduce how much. This also applies to agriculture."

The climate package is an entry into CO2 pricing - and at the same time a clear signal that we don&#39;t want to leave anyone outside. But want to do it with everyone. 4.4
We have achieved something special with this #climate package: The Climate Protection Act introduces a regulatory mechanism that checks every year for each sector to see whether the goals are being achieved. And it enables us to readjust. 3.4
"We have an obligation to ensure that everyone can participate in climate protection. That is why the support measures are so important, for example when modernizing heating systems or buying electric cars. 2.4"
Malu #Dreyer at the #press conference on the #climate package: We have adopted a powerful package. It is important for us that we achieve the climate goals - but also that we stay together as a society. 1.4
"We act. With the #climate protection package, we are initiating a turnaround to achieve the 2030 climate targets. We will ensure that Germany&#39;s future is climate-friendly, socially and economically strong."

"We will make sure that people without a high income can afford an # electric car and that the charging stations are where they are needed. In this way, we will help # electric mobility to make a breakthrough in Germany."
"We want to massively promote a # CO2 price &amp; the switch to climate-friendly cars &amp; heaters. This means that those who drive large fuel-guzzling cars and pollute the environment more have to pay more. On the other hand, those who protect the #environment must also benefit financially."

"well, the streams are organized locally and not centrally. Therefore, they always turn out differently."
Economists usually base the CO-2 price on as the only steering tool. The SPD does not want to leave Klimschtz to the market alone. We rely on a climate protection law with binding reduction targets in every area and regulations on who has what to do.
"But politics has a responsibility to ensure that mobility is still possible, especially in rural areas."
"With a CO-2 price, which has an immediate steering effect, you push large parts into a waiver. In parallel to the rising price, alternatives to other behavior must be offered, including expanding public transport."
"That&#39;s not true, the Union simply couldn&#39;t make more than 10 euros."
"because the SPD ensured that we have a climate protection law, which is legally anchored and clearly states who has to do what in order to achieve our goals. In addition, we ensure that climate protection is socially just"
The reduction targets enshrined in the Climate Protection Act set the path for each sector annually - here it is not just a question of price control. Of course there are unknowns in technology development and interactions. That is why control of the target path is built in.
No
Later governments are bound by the climate protection law for the first time to the climate targets and can and must build on the current results. At the end of the transition phase there is regulatory law - if there are alternatives.
"The #Klimapaket: Too little, too slow, too late? Matthias #Miersch comments on the criticism: pic.twitter.com/HqygInk4cY"
It&#39;s just not true. We wanted more!
"Because the climate protection law is a great success. Finally, it is clearly regulated who has to do what and who is responsible, and it is also checked whether we are on the target path."
"We were also talking to him. O .E. wanted emissions trading is a pure market instrument. But we don&#39;t want to leave climate protection to the market. The state has responsibility, which is why a climate protection law."
"What do I do if there is no public transport on site? Unfortunately, it is very often the case that the bus runs once a day and not when it is needed."
"it&#39;s not that little. Until recently, the climate protection law was demonized as a planned economy and is now creating a reliable, verifiable reduction path. The CO 2 price is not the only effective tool."

People with little income benefit the most because they consume less CO2 on average than people with high income - so they get more money back from the # climate premium than they pay with a # CO2 price.
The idea is that all people living in Germany receive the same amount of money from the state from birth. # Climate premium # CO2
