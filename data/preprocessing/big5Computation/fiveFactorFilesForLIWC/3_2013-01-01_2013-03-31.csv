"Franzosen und Deutsche: einmal Freunde, immer Freunde / Germans and French: partners one day, partners always # elysée"
Bilingualism is a great vision for our region: the best we can do for our children and secure the future. #Saarland
Goal: #Saarland must be a competence center for dt.frz. Be collaboration at all levels.
"As the most French of all federal states, we also have to live up to our standards. #Saarland"
"Make Elysée Year # France. Over 80 events this year with many Saar countries, clubs, associations. Thank you!"
Can be proud of the work done at dt.frz. Understanding. But no need to rest. #Frankreichjahr
German-French history book has proven to be a great success. Makes an important contribution to dt.frz. Friendship.
Current events in Africa are closer than we think #mali. It is about defending fundamental freedoms.
In France children and families are a matter of course. An important cultural asset in F. I would also like that for Germany
"Until Cattenom shutdown can be realized, we should support every contribution that increases security in Cattenom."
The stated goal remains: the greatest possible security for people in the greater region. Therefore we are in favor of switching off Cattenom.
Dt.frz. Sentiment barometer: energy transition and environmental protection an important cross-border issue.
Competitiveness is a European. Question. Have to learn from each other when looking across the border.
Dt.frz. Friendship does not mean creating uniformity. Differences make dt.fz. Relationship exciting and keep it alive.
Germany and France must continue to drive the European To be agreement. Both have always given important impulses for this
"Have to deal with dt.frz friendship carefully and carefully, like with a best friend."
"Franco-German reconciliation has succeeded, dt.frz. Friendship is a matter of course today: it is extraordinary normality"
A look at the past shows: dt.frz. Reconciliation and European Agreement are of epochal importance.

Another important point from the coalition agreement implemented. New employee-friendly and yet practical tariff loyalty law is coming!
