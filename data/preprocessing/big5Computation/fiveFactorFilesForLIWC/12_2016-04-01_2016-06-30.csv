"@schaefer_j @dpa No. I was surprised that despite the balance of power, you are not considering that green, red and yellow have to help. #framing CL"
"@schaefer_j @dpa Uh, maybe wait and see what the FDP has achieved? ;) CL"
@wibkegt @FDPFraktionNRW I didn&#39;t. Greens like to ignore the context of climate protection. #pippilangstrumpf CL
@wibkegt your speaker Reiner Priggen even does the plenary. 😂 CL
@stahlwerke Cool ;) CL
@steelwerke Good question! TL
@Thomas_Wuest That&#39;s right. Police should take care of more important things. TL
In #NRW there is no need to worry about being flashed - you only stand in a traffic jam anyway ... CL #Blitzmarathon # StaulandNr1 #Blitzermarathon

@pehaus @fdp for that. TL

The problem is that #Kohl offers a platform for a politician who thinks again in national + non-European categories ... CL
The decision from #Kohl to #Orban is highly political + signal to #CDU. Apparently he wants his party&#39;s more conservative profile. CL
@Herr_Decker @ArminLaschet Have never seen a taxi from the plane to the gate. Would be something! ;) CL
@ MarkusObermeie1 @ArminLaschet Aren&#39;t you wrong .... CL
Just met @ArminLaschet in the airport bus in Tegel. There are coincidences;) CL pic.twitter.com/uLh2coKoMN
"Do you also find the picture #sexistic, @Angela_Dorn? Would report it to the advertising council. And don&#39;t drink the vodka. Is that # bourgeois now? CL"
#Digitization has long reached us all. We are just waiting for #Merkel. CL # FoGip16 pic.twitter.com/z36AuFepGn
#Merkel made Germany dependent on Turkey. #Erdogan is now taking advantage of this. #GroKo must swim politically free! CL # böhmermann
"Is a joke that #Erdogan in Germany uses the means of the rule of law against # Böhmermann, which he tramples on in Turkey ... CL"
"@ _fl01 @flueke Tweet is on. Regards, TL"
"Hey, if you think advertising is sexist: just don&#39;t buy. ;-) CL # no advertising #Maas"

After Guido #Westerwelle we lose a second of our great personalities. CL #Genscher pic.twitter.com/KXLPknSHqr
#Genscher made history and shaped our country. We have a lot to thank him for. Our grief cannot be greater. CL
"#Genscher died last night: the architect of unity, one of the founders of the EU and our fatherly friend. CL"
"# TeslaModel3 shows that it does not need a subsidy from #GroKo, but ideas .... CL #wake up # electromobility #tesla"
What is populist about who benefits from their policies? And who pays? CL
How much competitiveness is lost? What does grandma pay into the cash box of green investors? CL
. @ peter_simone Ask SMEs how he finds the EEG ... Greens want that few benefit and pensioners + Bafög recipients pay.CL
No ... CL

"Problems d. #Dairy farmers cannot be solved with subsidies for a long time. Structural change cannot be stopped, not even d. # Steuerzahlergeld.CL"
The #EEG money printing machine must finally be stopped by ending the automatic granting of permanent subsidies. CL
