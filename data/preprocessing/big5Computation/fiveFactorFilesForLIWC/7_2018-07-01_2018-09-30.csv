Tonight with the SPD candidate Jutta Kahler at the SPD summer party in Waldeck.
Back to the north today. Political groups in the Kiel State House today with the new Environment Minister Albrecht as a guest.
Numerous surprises in the first round of the DFB Cup. Fortunately not at the expense of the #nurderHSV
Today a walk through the town. Later back to Berlin for appointments.
"Today is the fourth stage of my summer trip. Public transport, which leads me to Bad Schwartau, L√ºbeck and Travem√ºnde."
Terrible calamity in Genoa indicates the importance of government controls and that public infrastructure should not be viewed only with fiscal glasses.
Now the first week of work after my vacation starts again. Last vacation week in Schleswig-Holstein.

"The budget debate in the state parliament follows today. The money comes from the happy government coalition. This covers a lot of conflicts and is covered with a lot of PR frosting. Nevertheless, there is plenty of murks to be seen in government work."
Today I&#39;m going to Fulda. I am a guest speaker at a rally against the right spirit in our country.

The first plenary day is on the agenda for the state parliament today. It&#39;s about inclusion and other important issues - but there are other things on the daily schedule.
"The change at the top of the Union&#39;s parliamentary group is a blow to the chancellor and CDU chairwoman Merkel. Despite (because of) her personal commitment, her long-time confidant Kauder is voted out. Troubled times in Berlin."
"At the annual reception of the state press conference there were the coveted ‚Äúpress ducks‚Äù this time for the three Jamaicans Buchholz, Heinold and Grote. When it comes to self-PR, the number of black traffic lights in the north is hard to beat üòé"

Nice theater evening yesterday in Kiel. There was the three-person play &quot;Art&quot; on a small stage with witty dialogues and acting finesse.
Later election campaign with the Jusos in Fulda.
"After a long day of meetings in Berlin yesterday, the parliamentary groups in the State House in Kiel again. In the evening, the open office with guests from health professions. Later the annual reception of the state press conference."
Reasonable solution to the personnel issue. A man who was intolerably in the office of head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is entrusted with other tasks and is not promoted. Now implement Koa contract 1: 1 and also clearly formulate as SPD&#39;s own profile as a left-wing People&#39;s Party.

Yesterday beautiful performance of Theodor Storm&#39;s &quot;Schimmelreiter&quot; in the version of the theater group in the Bruges village church.
"In any case, a sensible decision must now be made that will lead to a fresh start at the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, without rewarding the failed incumbent. Some other questions will probably be answered after the Bavarian election at the latest."
"In addition, patience with a grand coalition does not run out, but disenchantment with politics and right-wing populism are given extra stimulus if the focus is not on affordable housing, secure pensions or good work and education, but on Seehofer&#39;s escapades."
Just a radio interview with NDR Info about the Maassen affair. It was and is correct to correct a wrong decision instead of making it. Anyone who has made serious mistakes and undermined trust in the security authorities must not be promoted.
Market before breakfast. Very autumnal morning in the north. Afterwards to the opening of an educational policy event by the SPD parliamentary group and regional association in the Kiel State House.

"The patience with this grand coalition has become extremely thin. With Seehofer and his escapades, we got the plague on board. Shifting to the right everywhere is disturbing. There is so much to do with pensions, housing, work, day care centers, care, energy transition, Europe ..."
Despite all the satisfaction that the SPD has asserted that it cannot remain at the top of the protection of the constitution who has the political rights of AFD &amp; Co. protects more than the constitution. Personnel decision by Seehofer &amp; Co but oil in the fire of disenchantment with politics.
It&#39;s a good thing that we removed Mr. Maassen from his position as head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. It remains miserable and outrageous that Merkel&#39;s weakness and Seehofer&#39;s ineducibility made the goat gardener and promoted the propagator of right-wing conspiracy theories to the secretary of state.

The expectation is also justified https://twitter.com/aristokitten/status/1040129422106357760‚Ä¶

"Not correct. We certainly don&#39;t have enough passion in the fight against the enemies of democracy.

"Maassen is completely discredited for his behavior as head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Conclusion: credibility of the security organs massively damaged, Chancellor publicly snubbed, Minister of the Interior acts as the chief harmonizer of the right-wing mob, political damage to the land immense."
In the Bundestag @MartinSchulz showed how the SPD opposes a party that is far right and whose officials act as enemies of democracy. The agitators and racists and their pals from Pegida &amp; Co. must be resolutely fought politically!

"Bulwark for democracy and against nationalism for 155 years: social democracy! Politics for many and not for the few loud screams and hollow heads who want to make intolerance, racism and right-wing extremism hopeful in Germany."
Frau von der Leyen publicly speculates about German tornadoes over Syria. There will be no such thing. We support our Foreign Minister in his efforts to de-escalate and make peace talks for this region and its tormented people.
Cases surrounding the head of the constitution protection agency Maassen remain completely unacceptable. The extreme right must be monitored and controlled and must not be cheered on and friendly advice given by playing down the right-wing mob. Maassen&#39;s deadline expires.
Good starting position for the SPD candidate before the runoff election for the mayor&#39;s office in Heide. There is still something!
Rightward shift also in the elections in Sweden. Still a clear lead for the Social Democrats and only third place for the right-wing populists. Difficult government formation in sight.

Here again the suggestions of Andrea Nahles and @tsghessen how the SPD wants to restore the basic right to affordable housing.

"Freezing rents and fighting speculation with housing are just a few of Andrea Nahles + @tsghessen&#39;s suggestions with which we want to make the fundamental right to affordable housing a reality again. Whether it is secure pensions or social rents - many things are not possible with the Union, which is why #SPD"
Housing is a fundamental right. But you also have to be able to afford it. That is the task of a state capable of action that intervenes in the event of market failure. The SPD stands for safe pensions and affordable housing. @Tsghessen presents our suggestions today.
"If the market fails and the market economy becomes anti-social, as in the case of overpriced rents and priceless living space, social democrats have to act, even if the conservative and liberal do not like it. @tsghessen shows how affordable housing and social responsibility work."
"Affordable housing is a human and civil right. Speculation with housing, overpriced rents and privileges for luxury apartments, we Social Democrats are determined to fight. This is what @tsghessen and @NataschaKohnen stand for. The whole SPD fights with passion!"
"There is not much going on in GroKo on the most important social issues such as secure pensions or affordable housing. After all, this must be implemented 1: 1 according to the contract! @Tsghessen shows in our demands for a social housing policy what would be possible with a stronger SPD in elections!"
"The events surrounding Mr. Seehofer and his head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Maassen, as well as the populist rhetoric of encouragement, only allow the interpretation that blinking to the right takes place instead of making a strong effort to ensure that the right-wing mob is put in its place."
Market before breakfast. Today a few things to do on the weekend after a fairly turbulent week and before an equally busy working week.
The right-wing populist debate about public service broadcasting was more about our democracy. The AFD representatives in the state parliament are right-wing extremists who must be fought with all their might!
"The budget debate yesterday showed above all much self-praise in the government coalition&#39;s &quot;Bullerb√º&quot; speech by the finance minister. They have luck and money, but little sense of the social. North German solo action against daycare parents, employee and tenant interests."
The September session of the state parliament ends today and the autumn holidays begin in the north.

Passionate debate yesterday about new deportation prison to build black traffic light coalition for northern Germany. The response to our criticism is very significant: Green people have a guilty conscience and thin-skinned black people even wood on their social media pages.
"There is growing outrage everywhere about the intolerable outgoing head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Maassen, who was certainly not to become State Secretary.

Removing Maassen as head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution was a democratic necessity for the SPD + hurts right-wing democracy enemies. Parties decide on their staff in departments themselves. Unspeakable CSU decision to make Maassen State Secretary. GroKo patience becomes extremely thin.
"Maassen was a helper to AFD &amp; Co. As head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, it was not sustainable and was removed from office thanks to the SPD. Seehofer&#39;s brazen decision to make Maassen State Secretary promotes disenchantment with politics and hopefully his departure soon after the Bavarian election."
"Maassen has seriously damaged trust in security agencies + helped rights against which he should protect the constitution. He is out of office, as requested by the SPD. Seehofer&#39;s decision to make Bock a gardener (State Secretary) + Duo infernale Seehofer &amp; Maassen remains disaster"

Let us fight for progressive majorities in our parties so that the miserable shift to the right can be countered everywhere by a left-wing government majority of progressive parties on this side of the Union parties! This is much smarter than this PR project around Wagenknecht &amp; Co.
Collection movements can make sense in the case of peace or climate protection. But as an instrument of competing parties under the leadership of notorious separatists and proven SPD opponents like Sahra Wagenknecht and Oskar Lafontaine? Upright social partners don&#39;t fall for that.
"Sahra Wagenknecht and a few others speak up with the so-called &quot;left-wing collection movement&quot;. It would be more correct if all parties involved do something to win a progressive majority on this side of the Union. In addition, foreclosure and nationalism are not left!"
"Predominantly fair reporting or public comment on the change at the head of our state party planned for next spring. For me, however, this is not a retreat, as a group leader and deputy federal chairman there is still a lot to do!"
"Today, the executive bodies meet in the Kiel State House to prepare for the plenary session this week. In the evening a round with the district leaders of the North SPD."

Debate about alleged &quot;political correctness&quot; instead of &quot;talking about what is&quot; or complaining about &quot;political opinion cartels&quot; remains misleading as long as it means to hide lack of humanity + empathy as realism. Solve problems and respect human dignity!

"Seehofer today presents the so-called ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù, about which there had been unworthy theater for weeks, with abstruse undemocratic greetings in the Bavarian royal family. It&#39;s simple: the master plan is called the coalition agreement. Implement, Mr. Seehofer!"

Neither DFB nor hypocrites + racists have understood or done anything right in the disgusting √ñzil debate - no resentment! I also have little sympathy for millionaires who neither convince in sports nor outside. There are enough ambitious talents who want to be role models.
Shrill debate about √ñzil&#39;s withdrawal from the national team. Racist tones + anti-alien clich√©s completely wrong! Pity for millionaires who don&#39;t convince either on or off the pitch is also inappropriate. There are enough talents who strive to be role models.
