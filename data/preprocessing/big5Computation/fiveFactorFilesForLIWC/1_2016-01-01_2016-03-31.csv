@n_meter We only started compulsory German courses 10 years ago and they look great.
@ Xtazy13 do you also have factual arguments? I haven&#39;t found one yet.
"@n_meter We ensure compliance with the law, for learning German and working. If that succeeds, everything else will come."

"@ victor5679 We provide refugees with food, access to school and the job market. And we continue to accept refugees."
@ Nessie43 you have a wonderful language! You will be blocked for this!
Message to European friends in Brussels: Our feelings and thoughts are with you. We will do our best to protect the Union!
@TheHumbleJosh dark is meaning! What did i do
"All solidarity now with EU, Belgium, #Brussels! Terrorists will never win: Our European values much stronger than hate, violence, terror!"
"Dear @KonstantinNotz, amendment BND law is by no means on hold, it is intensively worked and maybe. in the end you also participate!"
Great success for Germany and Europe! All 28 EU countries + Turkey have unanimously agreed on a joint solution to the refugee crisis.
Guido Westerwelle has shaped the political debate and culture in Germany for a quarter of a century. Now he died far too young. RIP
@MK_Demiroglu What happened to your idea from 2015? Does the association already exist?
@KatherineSKS So it will happen!
@dani_brandt :-))
@dani_brandt Somehow I missed you! :-)
"@SueMaeSoong @ulfposh @welt Congratulations, you&#39;re blocked!"
@ 59karli82 But very teaching and helpful! Twitter forever!
@schillertschon Sometime is always the first time! :-)
@schieritz sic! :-)
@ TheBug0815 @schieritz It&#39;s Plan C! Just call my office and make an appointment: 030-184002070: Mr. Breit
"@horstKL And they&#39;re awesome, but blocked right now!"
@wegecon This is wrong. I have only listed what the federal government is already doing.
@TPfannstiel Those who mob like you deserve to be blocked! Bye!
"@EikeUkena I only see now: good idea! :-) As the audience ages, the image of the hero changes! :-)"
@Det_Malinkewitz I want the CDU BaWÃ¼ u Guido Wolf to get as many votes as possible! Continuing from red / green would be suboptimal!
"@ chrisschmitt94 Maybe not because the Saarland is so big. But how about NRW, Hessen, BaWÃ¼ and Bavaria ?! :-)"
"Dear @JuliaKloeckner, I keep my fingers crossed that you will become Prime Minister. Would be great for Rhineland-Palatinate and beyond!"
@ Haneri81 I&#39;m always honest :-)
"@schieritz As long as there is an influx from Turkey to the EU - more than 3,000 yesterday - the Balkan closure will not do anything because GR cannot carry the load."
@OlliLuksic ????? I was referring to the admission of refugees and only that.
@OlliLuksic I said that TURKING 3 MILLION REFUGEES to Turkey. behaved as some EU MS. Where is the connection?
@stahlwerke @schieritz Just call my office: 030-184002070. Ask about Mr. Breit.
@schieritz you should do quietly. The problem also has to do with the fact that those responsible have not dealt with it for many years
@chvoyage Heartlessness really doesn&#39;t suit me. Resettlement and relocation are often the last hope for those who have lost everything.
@schieritz It&#39;s not like this: Both need cooperation. Turkey has 3 million refugees and cannot sustain the burden alone in the long run
@Wolkenhorst @schieritz It won&#39;t be that way right now.
@lukasgehrke @schieritz Certainly!
@ TheBug0815 @schieritz But only if there is whiskey in the glass instead of water ...
@Tony_Cavallaro Of course! And greetings back home!
@schieritz @ TheBug0815 And that is exactly why the cooperation is in mutual interest!
"@Tony_Cavallaro The steel industry is currently experiencing problems worldwide, and we are guaranteed not to forget the Saarland steel industry!"
Look forward ! They have always been more the solution than the problem! https://twitter.com/MitterlehnerR/status/707202255091601408â€¦
@stahlwerke @schieritz For a Saarlander always and gladly. Come to my citizens&#39; office in Lisdorf
@chvoyage Dark is your speech meaning ...
Incomprehensible. The terrorists must never win! Europe&#39;s values are stronger than hate and violence! All solidarity for Brussels and the EU.
@kingscrossed @schieritz deportation is never voluntary. Completely wrong comparison.
@KaiserMedien Ja.
@schillertschon Relocation and resettlement are alternatives to escape. And sure.
@Azrooth @petertauber You will be puzzled about this for centuries. Perhaps: too nice in the end ...
"@schieritz We don&#39;t either, but it&#39;s better to fight causes and smugglers at the beginning of the &quot;chain&quot;. Therefore Turkey&#39;s approach is correct."
@ rowe316 You must have heard that wrong! I am never happy when people are harmed or killed.
"@FlorianGathmann @twitter Distance always works; Given the enormous impact of the new medium, my tweet was rather hypothermic! :-)"

"@J_Kirfel and then also for China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, ...?"
@J_Kirfel Why? The restriction shows that we take our humanitarian demands seriously and do not gloss over anything.
@DrKissler @BeaBaethge @NorgePrivacy Thank you! :-)
@BeaBaethge @NorgePrivacy @DrKissler Somehow I must have missed something ?! What was going on?
@ victor5679 @juergentuecks not at all: we corrected it. 9 billion more (London conference on February 4) reached again
"@irishjulian There are good accommodations for them in GR. From there, those in need of protection are then distributed to other EU countries. Even after D."
"@hennig_o @schieritz Yes, for those who are not in need of protection and whose asylum applications have been legally rejected."
". @ schieritz Only successful combating of smugglers enables relocation and resettlement, which helps those who are really in need."
"@ManuelaSchwesig Congratulations to the proud parents! Little Julia a carefree childhood and an exciting, fulfilling life!"
@StrautM Well thought out! :-) We will be very careful when talking about individual questions.
@Valencamueller Today is local elections and for all of Hesse it is important that cities and communities are well governed
Hessen has a great state government led by the CDU! I wish my friends a fantastic day there!

@may_jakob You have created an enemy image to fight it :-). Feel free to invite me if you are interested in a discussion of the subject.
"@tmg_bdh @netzpolitik That is even in the law. And I did not ask for a concrete change, but called for a discussion"
@netzpolitik 2/2 could be used for police purposes without jeopardizing the legitimate protection concerns of those affected.
@netzpolitik ... nu can do without tzrW protection level
"@ Network policy on toll data, I made no specific request, but discussed the question of whether such u other data 1/2"
"@netzpolitik I haven&#39;t seen Heise specifically yet, but I have seen various tweets. Do you have a link to heise?"
