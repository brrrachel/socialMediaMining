@ForcesReviewUK I called out Mr. Fallon's hypocrisy; lecturing European neighbors about spending hikes while cutting. @GeorgeOsborne #SLD15
"Fallon mentions Europe only 2 say: Brits ""pressure fellow European allies"" to spend more on defense. How much does UK spend >2% GDP? #SLD15"
"UK's Michael Fallon stresses several times: Britain is ""global player"". Advocates ""will and power to enforce peace"". Really boastful. #SLD15"
"UK MinDef Fallon: tensions in South China Sea & East China Sea are ""not just a regional consideration"", but global concern. #SLD15"
"PM Lee: ""So far"" China's rise is peaceful. Will that continue? Lee signals: Yes, if China defines its role within int'l rule of law. #SLD15"
"Singapur PM Lee calls China the 2nd economic power in the world. I think it is rather the 3rd, after EU & U.S.; how come he forgets? #SLD15"
Dr. Chipman in opening #SLD15 asks the one central question: Which kind of security order in Asia will allow best long term development?
Everybody still gearing up for opening of #SLD15. Singapore PM Lee will probably try to sooth some tensions tonite. pic.twitter.com/u9HAHSNyvp
#Putin wants to be able to treat the death of Russian soldiers in &quot;special actions&quot; as a state secret in the future. Then every critic becomes an enemy of the state.
@Michabl There are a few revolutions ahead that I would certainly be happy to help leading. Like the Green industrial revolution. ;-)
