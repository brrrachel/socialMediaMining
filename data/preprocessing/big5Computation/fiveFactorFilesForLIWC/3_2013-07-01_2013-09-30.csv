End of the duel #muttihatsmade !!!
@OlliLuksic so little confidence in your own strength?
Merkel wants an international response to the poison gas attack in Syria and reminds China and Russia of their responsibility!
"Merkel honest about data protection. Internationally, our data protection rights do not apply by far. This has to be negotiated hard!"
“@RZ_Brueck: Merkel doesn&#39;t attack aggressively and still hits #tvduell” That&#39;s right!
Merkel&#39;s answers to euro crisis understandable for people; Steinbrück&#39;s only for technocrats
"From vacation to the Schiffweiler village festival to celebrate 40 years of partnership with Greifenburg / Carinthia. Great people, great atmosphere!"
“@Sigmargabriel: Peer asks the better questions! #tvduell ”But people want answers from the chancellor. And Merkel gives it!
It becomes clear right from the start who the candidate and who is rightly the Chancellor.
