"Daul (EPP) in debate: without substance, &quot;heart-warming&quot; words, melodious goals, &quot;pools of excellence&quot;, sentences from the archive, evades concretion."
Barroso is proud to be European + is a little offended by advice from Washington + Beijing. Now let&#39;s see what follows the words.
"FORSA figures: # Pirate voters come from GRÜN (11%), SPD (10), Union (16), FDP (13), non / new voters (30). Only 6% pirate voters Program."
"Barroso: wants Europe to be active worldwide, so that there is no G2, because bipolarity was not a good thing in the Cold War. #soteu"

@christiansoeder Should only improve transparency. ;-)
Barroso now calls euro bonds stability bonds. Says some could also be introduced under the Lisbon Treaty. Announce that. #soteu
"Bisky (GUE): The idea of European unification is also a left one, at least by many. He says that correctly. ;-) I believe him."
"Barroso: Commission is EU economic government, we don&#39;t need new institutions. Big applause from the EP. (For real?)"
"If ratified, the EFSF must used effectively (means leverage?), ESM must be accelerated, ECB should do what is necessary. #soteu"
@christiansoeder This report on road safety was made by an East German CDU MP.
Barroso gives State of the Union speech in the European Parliament. First describes the drama of the crisis. Requires leadership. Says: gives way out.
Harms: criticizes &quot;forgetfulness&quot; europ. #Sustainability Policy. At this economically crucial. Barroso remains weak.
"@Lanzenheim Admit that it will be colorful. SPD interpretation (if there is no redeployment, then A100) is not acceptable for Greens in my opinion."
