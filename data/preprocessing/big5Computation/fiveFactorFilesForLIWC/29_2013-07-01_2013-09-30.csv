@PhilipPlickert there comes the great awakening / people and great regret / government / opposition And then the Germans take to the streets .. ouch
"@HollyGoMadly @Volker_Beck Self-actualization at work is an elite privilege. But the majority just toil, plow, malo."
#AfD #Euro crisis Berlin-Mitte is now AfD blue too. Poster campaign a complete success. Here are the pictures: http://url9.de/HTw
@thorstenreschke Because I want to change direction.
"Berlin is now AfD blue. What an action! I recommend a trip over the Alex, or past the CDU #AfD pic.twitter.com/zOu8WxtVG9"
... at the moment my election posters still look like this: #AfD pic.twitter.com/VgGrC14gL3
@Volker_Beck @groehe And one hundred percent!
... the countdown is on: Berlin-Mitte is sticking posters. It will be a HOT night !!! pic.twitter.com/68kxbezXuh
@Volker_Beck childcare allowance not higher than the average day care place. The same right for all financiers: Compliance with EU constitution = no bailout
@GregorGysi childcare by mother = 19th century? That means: only external care is good? Good mothers are on the assembly line?
@Volker_Beck I am in favor of not despising and ridiculing mothers&#39; performance as a # hearth premium. But to promote like external care.
"@Volker_Beck #AfD is against discrimination against women, which make the most important task for society 24h / 7days: bringing up children."

"SPON is titled, The climate does not warm up - for 15 years. So SPON now also denies climate change. Stop the EEG! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHx8zc0a7yk… #AfD"
@Volker_Beck Only women on the assembly line are good women? And women who look after strange children? In daycare centers. Just not your own?
@SPIEGEL_Top DUET. It is a DUET. No DUEL.
No military action in #Syria! Aggressive war against civil war is not the solution and not our task. #AfD

"@HollyGoMadly &quot;Merkel slowed down? The 1st Greek package, the 2nd, the EFSF, the ESM, the banking union, the Cyprus rescue - what exactly?"
Now the CDU is honest: &quot;Greece will keep us busy for 15 to 20 years - if it goes well.&quot; http://url9.de/JST #AfD
Abolish EEG! The EEG is at least as anti-social as the so-called &quot;Euro rescue&quot; and about as expensive. #AfD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHx8zc0a7yk&amp;feature=youtu.be…

#AfD - TV: Unfortunately not superfluous at all! And done very professionally. Look at! When do the ÖR bring something like that? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2u5kEoa4n8…
@saschaleib Well recognized. The fact that the Bible demands the euro is just as nonsense as the interference of the archbishop.
@OnlyPlayin @dneuerer Ja.
@dneuerer The Bible is crystal clear for the euro and the EU central government. So cath. Core area touched. Interference is a must. # AfD
@Volker_Beck What is not actually &quot;right-wing populist&quot;?

@franz_afd Nothing is stronger than the truth!

Fortunately there is no such thing as an #AfD. Just read the program :-)
@f_schaeffler @Volker_Beck Previously-financed banks deficits voluntarily. Now the risk is too great.
"@Volker_Beck And where does it now stand that all who care and take care of each other, have a marriage, otherwise would also be with 3 people o 7?"
@Volker_Beck @Beatrix_vStorch
@Volker_Beck And where does the BGB or GG state that mutual responsibility u stand for each other = marriage?
"@Volker_Beck Who is doing that? For whom marriage is not just about love, sex and care?"
@Volker_Beck @peersteinbrueck @rbbinforadio And before 2005? Nothing? #echelon? #BadAibling? #Griesheim
"Merkel: We are not a surveillance state. Me: But if EVERYTHING is recorded, every mail, everything, what is a surveillance state? #AfD"
@peersteinbrueck @rbbinforadio I&#39;m excited to see if US surveillance really started after the SPD government?

#Eurorettung #AfD So the CDU now wants the soli fund. The SPD the euro bonds. There is an alternative that is also called that!

Secretary of the Interior Friedrich must represent German citizens and not the interests of the US monitors. WE SHOULD BE FAIR? http://url9.de/GCc #Snowden
Showing a woman using a washing machine is hostile sexism? #Gender - stop fanaticism! Choose #AfD!
"Not to compare US espionage with the GDR Stasi? Of course not! At that time there was no TOTAL surveillance of ALL citizens, no internet etc."
A monitored government can be blackmailed. And the people are unfree. My comment on #Snowden on RussiaToday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqnCLuOaeQQ…

Anyone who really condemns our spying on the United States must also grant #Snowden asylum - everything else is lying. Choose #AfD!
#EU wants to soften deficit targets. No surprise that. Commitments do not apply. You can only rely on breaking all promises. Choose #AfD!
Who accepts the bet: # Debt Settlement Fund and #Eurobills reject government and opposition - and do it in the end?
I have the signatures for the #AfD and me together. They have yet to be confirmed. Fingers crossed! pic.twitter.com/BDz3rdLp9K
"State # vaccination requirement? demands a liberal minister? Or rather the pharmaceutical lobby? Is there no room left, the taboo for the state?"
President #Obama has to apologize to the German citizens for the #NSA scandal - and let it be spied on. There is no trust before.
#NSA Merkel says: Spying is &quot;unacceptable&quot;. I say: this is a scandal. Why? Read here http://www.beatrixvonstorch.de/19/
