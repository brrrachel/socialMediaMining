"In this respect, Anne Will&#39;s show yesterday was again the demonstration of different worlds and clear - the spirit is still on the left! QED!"
What is called pragmatism + transfigured as brave is rather right + yesterday&#39;s visions for more justice do not understand such people!
"With Anne Will, FDP-Lindner and media professor attack Margot Käßmann with undisguised arrogance of alleged political expertise."
MP Carstensen will be at the opening of Kiel Week. State political zero performance booed-tired jokes at the opening reception.
"The candidate for mayor, who was supported by the SPD and the Greens, prevailed in Husum. Congratulations! CDU is betting on the wrong horse!"
The FDP tax reduction fetish is indeed spreading back to the Union. Bright campaign panic and irresponsible politics!

"It would be sensible now, apart from the 7 old scrap piles, which remain off the network, the other peu a peu and to switch off as soon as possible!"
Making nuclear phase-out irreversible + with a clear end in 2022 is a political success of years of struggle! The phase-out must now be done professionally!

Black and yellow must correct itself in the case of atomic energy - not the SPD. Despite all the criticism in detail: Today it becomes true what the SPD decided 25 years ago.
SH SPD has been fighting for nuclear phaseout for decades. The atomic lobby has fought us bitterly for years.
Bad 2010 nuclear deal has to be revised = Union&#39;s energy policy waterloo. Fukushima + surveys do not inspire Union.
"Despite all the criticism of the details, the nuclear phase-out and withdrawal of the black and yellow atomic deal remains good, even if the cause is not clear."
We have been in favor of the nuclear phase-out for decades - CDU / FDP have always slandered + fought against it.
"In energy policy, the Federal Government presents itself as a &quot;silent reserve&quot;, Merkel &amp; Co in standby mode. Active energy transition is different!"

Good morning from Berlin. Still stunned by the Union&#39;s bold party-political maneuver yesterday in the constituency committee of the SH state parliament.
"The icing on the cake is that the Lübeck FDP deputy also votes against Lübeck, as in the government&#39;s attempt to dismantle the university."
CDU pretends to own the country. Grotesque constituency intersection to secure benefices. # Deselecting!
"Bad power policy of the CDU SH in constituency intersection. With the help of the FDP and SSW, unfortunately, also the election officer, a farce was decided."
"Anti-Lübeck has a long tradition with the government, the CDU apparently in a clear preselection panic - unfortunately poor support from everyone except the SPD, Green, Left."
Apparently outrageous party political deal in favor of the CDU in the constituency committee of the SH Landtag. Later more.
Good morning from Bordesholm. Different dates in Berlin today. Music tip: Helen Reddy &quot;Angie Baby&quot;. Happy Thursday everyone!

Good morning from Bordesholm. Today Kiel dates for culture and integration. Music tip: John Fogerty &quot;Henrietta&quot;. Nice Wednesday!
We will create policy changes in SH! Yellow and left out of state parliament?! Poll very encourages to work hard for change of government!

Good morning from Bordesholm. Music tip: Cat Stevens &quot;Morning has broken&quot;. You all a good Sunday!

"Educational and integration-political curd, which is otherwise represented by right-wing populists - SPD must not be used for that!"
One can accept an arbitration award; Sarrazin&#39;s intolerant push with which he makes money remains unacceptable. Has nothing in common with SPD values!
"@manomama is unfortunately correct, because this kind of integration and educational policy quark is otherwise only represented by right-wing populists!"
"@manomama even if an arbitration award has to be accepted, intolerant thrust with which he makes coal remains unacceptable - nothing to do with the SPD!"

"Nuclear lobby, health lobby and gambling lobby: Powerful financial interests threaten the common good and black and yellow opens the doors!"
@andreasberan Kubicki and von Boetticher hold the political umbrella over private gambling sharks. Self-interest before the common good!

May the Conservatives pound dubious black constituencies - the CDU &amp; FDP&#39;s singing in the north has begun. # Deselecting!
No one wants black and yellow anymore and the Left Party is not needed: SPD / Greens will also change politics in SH on 6 May 2012!
Nice election result in Bremen: Clear majority for red-green over 60%. CDU third party and FDP outside. Good prospects for SH: Policy change 2012

SPD parliamentary group takes part in &quot;Day of Care&quot; with one-day internship by fellow MPs. I&#39;m at the FEK in Neumünster tomorrow.
FDP has removed only woman from the management level - interesting departure signal: Brüderle instead of Homburger = FDP rejuvenation!
SH-FDP apparently has a particularly bad standing at federal level: head of state Koppelin voted out of parliamentary group because of Kubicki&#39;s sayings ?!
Open office with representatives of emergency services and civil protection was very interesting.
Good morning from Bordesholm on summer Tuesday. Today parliamentary bodies. Music tip: Sade &quot;Smooth operator&quot;. Nice day!

@aristokitten what is it?
@markushagge Them-Tweet!
Congratulations!
You just have to get involved in gags - went pretty well today - the soccer goalkeeper was really arrogant with glasses &amp; butt less!
Soothing @ sugar nose?
@krewor Yes!
@davidwelsch tomorrow!
@kleinkram?
@manomama worth reading and something to think about!
@GoethesMatrix if you don&#39;t become anything else would be pretty absurd!
Coming from &quot;Stuckrad Late Night&quot;. Very entertaining TV show with ex-colleague Schönbohm in Berlin.
My press release on Sarrazin: http://www.spd-schleswig-holstein.de/index.php? sp = en &amp; id = 78 &amp; aid = 1295
The one whom Klaus v.Dohnanyi calls &quot;lateral thinkers&quot; is at best a flat thinker. The SPD really doesn&#39;t need such right-wing populists!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today to Berlin. Music tip: Visage &quot;Fade to Gray&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone!
@knuddellove tweet it anyway!
@kleinkram sounds infectiously cheerful!; -}
@MichaSchilling unfortunately read every line. Review at SPON.
@Pillendreher read it and reviewed it early - online at SPIEGEL.
"It is not a question of continuing to offer Sarrazin publicity, but of averting damage to SPD reputation among those who are really important!"
"Lots of well-intentioned advice to let the subject rest. The problem is not S. is important, but the criticism of those who are concerned about SPD values!"
"Freedom of expression, pseudoscience + alleged facts (&quot;one can still say&quot;) are misused as a shield against basic values!"
"Intolerance, agitation against foreigners, contempt for human beings in language + program, elitist images of human beings - all of these do not fit right-wing populists to the SPD!"
Party order procedures are complicated + hardly publicly conveyable. Everyone understands that Sarrazin&#39;s theses do not fit SPD basic values!
That Sarrazin also sounds hard to bear. He could really do something good if he leaves our SPD as soon as possible!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Music tip: John Lennon &quot;Woman&quot;. Have a nice Tuesday!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Easter weekend as painted! Music tip: Deep Purple &quot;April&quot;. Have a nice Easter Monday!
Traditional Easter egg hunt by the Bordesholmer SPD in wonderful weather in the forest near the community center great fun for children + happy parents!
"@AngieDor is not about stage: S. should switch to his friends! SPD stands for educational justice, integration and human dignity - always!"
"Fundamental values of the SPD such as justice and solidarity are not compatible with anti-alien slogans, biological nonsense + men&#39;s language!"
Lots of reactions to the Sarrazine case. Arbitration or not - whoever propagates contempt for human right should be allowed!
@augensternchen_ I wish that back!
Music tip today: Ryan Paris &quot;Dolce vita&quot;. Happy Saturday everyone!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Sunny Easter weekend ahead. Newspapers illuminate Sarrazinthema: S. must not discredit SPD!
Music tip suitable today: Georges Moustaki &quot;Le meteque&quot;. Have a nice day everyone!
The volunteers who work for integration are really doing something. SPD must not tolerate that our party is misused for intolerance!
Repentance would be credible if book proceeds were used for integration projects. I have just seen such a Roma project in Romania.
"The decision of the independent arbitration commission is one, Sarrazin&#39;s waivers for future behavior too, book remains unacceptable!"
Good morning on Good Friday from Bordesholm.
"Basic values of the 150 year old SPD are not available: freedom, justice and solidarity! The S-Book breathes none of it!"
Good discussion about &quot;Tatort Zukunft&quot; with Jusos and Grüner Jugend in my office. Should be continued!
Agency reports about northern German SPD suggest SH criticism of federal SPD. I expressly support Sigmar Gabriel&#39;s course since Dresden.
Read something very special about &quot;spouse splitting&quot; in a large weekly newspaper today.
Newspapers report on the sticky lobbying activity of the gaming industry and its black and yellow friends in Schleswig-Holstein.
Today also Girls Day and visitors in the State House.
@GabiHillerOhm there he is ...
Good morning from Bordesholm. Today again different dates in Kiel. Music tip: Rumer &quot;Slow&quot;. Have a nice Thursday.
Tax concept of the SH SPD from 2004: Strengthening communities in a different way. 10 points for a simple and fair tax policy!
Wiegard is following in the footsteps of Bierdeckel-Merz and Heidelberg Professor Kirchhof with tax proposals: simple-unjust-ruinous!
MP Carstensen can be celebrated again with CCS law. It&#39;s better to read the fine print first: the country clause must be finally watertight!
Good morning from Bordesholm. A few more appointments in Kiel today. Music tip: Elton John &quot;The circle of life&quot;. Happy Wednesday everyone!
Good morning from Berlin. Back to Kiel for the parliamentary group meeting before Easter break. Music tip: Roy Buchanan &quot;Sweet dream&quot;. Have a nice Tuesday!
"Press review of the SPD state party conference in Husum offers interesting and diverse impressions, both regionally and nationally."
"Good morning from Bordesholm, now it&#39;s time for the Easter break, today again Berlin SPD bodies. Music tip: Hot Chocolate &quot;Everyone&#39;s a winner&quot;."
"The remaining term of the Carstensen &amp; Kubicki government has started. On May 6, 2012, the policy change in the north is coming!"
Good decisions and a much better mood than Miesepeter wants to make the public aware. SPD in SH goes to work!
"Back from the successful state party congress of the SH SPD in Husum, great trust for the new state board, orientation by Torsten Albig."
Music tip: Genesis &quot;I Know what I like&quot;. Have a nice spring Sunday from the not gray city by the sea!
Good morning from Husum. Successful first day at the state party conference of the North SPD. Today speech by Torsten Albig and further elections.

"Good morning from Bordesholm. Dates in Kiel, Regen and Kieler Woche. Music tip: Joe Cocker &quot;Sail away&quot;. Happy Saturday everyone!"
Nice ceremony in Bordesholm: Hans Wiesen awarded the SPD Willy Brandt Medal and honorary membership in the local association!
@tsghessen you you you!
@tsghessen toi toi tou!
@YoungSocialist knows that you can hardly believe it - but that&#39;s the way it is. Federal government is pretty bad-SH government at amateur league level!
I wish everyone in my timeline a happy and successful Friday and then a relaxing weekend!
"@ victor5679 You have mixed up something: Carstensen &amp; Kubicki are indeed doing well, but the country SH is not."
"Quiz question: When will the worst government in Germany be replaced? Answer: The CDU / FDP government in SH will be voted out on May 6, 2012!"
Black and yellow monument protection law in the neoliberal zeitgeist of yesterday. # Deselect! SH needs government again that knows the word common good!
CDU + FDP want to sell university clinic. State election must be referendum on privatization plans! Only SPD secures public UKSH!
Good morning from Bordesholm. Rain clouds announce Kieler Woche. Today&#39;s honor from Hans Wiesen. Music tip: Bryan Adams &quot;Summer of 69&quot;.
