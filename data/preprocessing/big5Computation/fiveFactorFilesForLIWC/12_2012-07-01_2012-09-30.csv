@TwittingThom Why pay the costs of the industry? Misinformation: Exceptions there financed certificate trading.
@peteraltmaier now also wants to reform the EEG. I wonder if there will be less subsidy and more competition for renewables.

@lassebecker I guess what&#39;s in there ...
@_KayaKi_ Neither nor. Public utilities can access their own sources in the model. Green energy policy is expensive and serves the solar lobby.
"@_KayaKi_ Model of the monopoly commission: Electricity traders are committed to volume, for example, in 2020 35 percent must come from renewables."
"@_KayaKi_ And there is a reason for this: This EEG has nothing (more) to do with the success of the energy transition, but only with interest in returns."

@stanglfr @ migrate89 Anything else is enough.
"@Pirat_Robert @joergimd What exactly do you mean about Mr. Friedrich, colleague?"
@ migrate89 I said it&#39;s a coalition compromise. And that I hope the CSU will not do so because of debts. That applies.
@junggruen There are no changing majorities in coalitions.
@ sundowner66 Unfortunately the Bundestag switched off faster than expected. Now runs.
@ Bocki4 Read the background on my website under biography.
"@drmfuchs Don&#39;t ask, do it! :-) The coalition should amend the EEG. The latest consensus on photovoltaics was counterproductive."
@ ReinhardSchult1 Quite your opinion. Therefore: EEG amend according to the model of the monopoly commission.
@ Bocki4 Uninformed. Read FAZ tomorrow. There #Meldegesetz is shown more differentiated.
@Volker_Beck And Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation and BeamtenG are we dropping under the table? We have to do this against the CSU.
