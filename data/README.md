# Data
This folder contains all scripts and files needed for gathering and preparing our data.
## Crawling
This project is all about tweets and their metainformation. To get them we have to crawl them from Twitter. How we do 
this is discribed [here](crawling/README.md).
## Translation
Since the model we are using for the big five factor calculation only works with english tweets, we translated all our 
tweets. More information can be found [here](translation/README.md).
## Preprocessing
After crawling and translating the tweets we have to make some preprocessing. What we do and especiall how you can find 
[here](preprocessing/README.md).
